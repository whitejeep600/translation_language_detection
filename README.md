# Translation language detection

The repository contains the code and report for the task we invented as the final project in Applied Deep Learning, 2022. In brief, it investigates the possibility of detecting the source language of text translated into English by SOTA machine translation models.

The `report` directory contains a detailed description of the task, previous work, our models, training and testing data, experiments, and results. The `models` directory contains four different models we have created for the task. `scripts` contains auxiliary scripts we used to gather and preprocess the data.
