[{"paragraph": "Cone cells (for color) and rod cells (for low light contrast) on the retina detect and convert light into nerve signals for vision. The visual signals are then relayed to the brain via the optic nerve. The eye is usually shaped like a ball, filled with a transparent gel-like substance called a clear body, with a focusing lens and often with a rainbow membrane; relaxation or contraction of the muscles around the rainbow membrane changes the size of the pupil, thus regulating the amount of light entering the eye, and reducing aberrations when there is sufficient light. The eyes in most cephalopods, fish, amphibians and snakes have a fixed lens shape, and focus the vision obtained with a telescopic lens - similar to the way a camera focuses. Compound eyes are found in arthropods and consist of many simple facets that, depending on anatomical details, can provide either a single pixelated image or multiple images per eye. Each sensor has its own lens and photosensitive cell. Some eyes have up to 28,000 such sensors, which are arranged hexagonally, and can provide a full 360\u00b0 field of vision. Compound eyes are very sensitive to movement. Some arthropods, including many Strepsiptera, have compound eyes of just a few facets, each with a retina capable of making images, creating vision. With each eye seeing something different, the images merge from all the eyes and a very distinct, high-resolution image is produced in the brain. Possessing detailed hyperspectral color vision, the centipede shrimp has been reported to have the most complex color vision system in the world. Trilobites, now extinct, had unique compound eyes. These animals used clear calcite crystals to form the lens of the eye. In this respect, Trilobites differ from most other arthropods that have soft eyes.", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "Millennials (also known as Generation Y or Late Generation) are the demographic group following Generation X (Gen-X). There is no definite time limit for the beginning and end of this group. Experts and researchers usually use the early 1980s as the beginning of the birth of this group to the early 2000s as the end. Millennials are generally the children of the Baby Boomers generation. Millennials are sometimes referred to as \"Echo Boomers\" because of the 'boom', birth rates in the 1980s and 1990s. Fortunately in the 20th century the trend towards smaller families in developed countries continued to grow, so the relative impact of the \"baby boom echo\" is generally not as great as that of the post-World War II population boom. The characteristics of Millennials vary by region and socio-economic conditions. However, this generation is generally characterized by an increased use of and familiarity with digital communications, media and technology. In most parts of the world, their influence is marked by increased political and economic liberalization; although their influence is still debated. The Great Recession had a profound impact on this generation resulting in high unemployment rates among young people, and led to speculation about the possibility of a long-term socio-economic crisis damaging this generation. About the characteristics of this millennial generation, in 2015, Pewresearch (pewresearch.org) had launched a report about this millennial generation or gen Y. 1. The census bureau in the United States stated that the population of the millennial generation in 2014 had reached 74.8 million people. It is estimated that in 2015 the population will increase to 75.3 million and become the largest generation group. 2. The millennial generation's immigration rate is higher than other generations.

In 2012, as quoted by livescience.com from USA Today, there was a study that showed that millennials are more individualized, quite ignorant of political issues, focus on materialistic values, and care less about helping others when compared to generation X and the baby boom generation at the same age. The study itself is based on the analysis of two databases of 9 million people who are in high school or who have just entered college. On the negative side, this generation is lazy, narcissistic, and likes to jump from job to job. However, on the other hand, they have a positive side. Among other things, millennials are open-minded individuals, supporters of equal rights (for example about LGBT or minorities). They also have good self-confidence, are able to express their feelings, are liberal, optimistic, and accepting of ideas and ways of life. Time magazine conducted a poll which showed that this generation wants a flexible work schedule, more 'me time' at work, and is open to advice and criticism, including career advice from their leaders. Authors William Strauss and Neil Howe are widely regarded as the originators of naming Millennials. They coined the term in 1987, at a time when children born in 1982 were entering pre-school, and when the media began referring to the cohort connected to the new millennium as graduating high school in 2000.

Gabriel told Mary to name her child Jesus, which means \"YHWH is salvation\". According to Luke 1:26, the Annunciation took place \"in the sixth month\" of Elizabeth's pregnancy with the baby John the Baptist. Many Christians commemorate this event with the Feast of Anunsiation or Annunciation on March 25, an approximate northern vernal equinox nine full months before Christmas, the ceremonial birthday of Jesus.Anunsiation was a major topic in Christian art in general, as well as in Marian art in the Catholic Church, particularly during the Middle Ages and Renaissance. A work of art depicting the Annunciation itself is often called an Anunsiation (Annunciation). In the Bible, this annunciation is recorded in Luke 1:26-38: 1:26 In the sixth month God sent the angel Gabriel to a town in Galilee called Nazareth, 1:27 to a virgin betrothed to a man named Joseph of the house of David; the virgin's name was Mary.1:28 When the angel entered Mary's house, he said: \"Hail, thou blessed one, the Lord is with thee.\" 1:29 Mary was astonished at these words, and asked herself what this greeting meant.1:30 The angel said to her: \"Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.1:31 Behold, you will conceive and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus.1:32 He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High God.", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "And the Lord God will give him the throne of David his father, 1:33 and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and his kingdom will have no end.\" 1:34 Mary said to the angel: \"How can this be, since I am unmarried?\" 1:35 The angel said to her: \"The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High God will overshadow you; therefore the child you will bear will be called holy, the Son of God.1:36 And behold, Elizabeth your kinswoman is with child in her old age, and this is the sixth month for her who is called barren.1:37 For with God nothing is impossible.\" 1:38 And Mary said, Behold, I am the servant of the Lord: be it unto me according to your word.

The company is one of the components of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index. The name \"ENI\" was originally an acronym for \"Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi\" (National Hydrocarbons Council). However, in the years since its establishment, the board has operated in a number of fields, such as contracting, nuclear power, energy, mining, chemicals and plastics, distribution and refining/extraction machinery, the assisted industry, and even the textile and news industry. In 2020, Eni ranked 113th on the Fortune Global 500 list and 24th in the energy sector. On the 2020 Forbes Global 2000 list, Eni ranked 468th. Eni was founded in 1953 from a pre-existing company, Agip, which was formed in 1926 to explore oil fields and acquire and commercialize oil and derivatives. In March 1953, Enrico Mattei was appointed chairman of Eni. Eni was originally an acronym for Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi (National Hydrocarbons Council). But in 1995, the company's name was officially shortened to just Eni.In 1952, the Eni logo was officially established. The logo featured a six-legged dog, to symbolize the number of wheels of a car and the legs of its driver. Starting in 1954, Eni acquired a number of exploration rights in North Africa, signing an agreement with the Egyptian government led by Nasser, while providing an equal and active role for the oil-producing country through the establishment of a joint venture.In 1957, Eni proposed a similar agreement, known as the \"Mattei formula\", to be signed with the Shah of Persia, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and the National Iranian Oil Company.In 1960, during the Cold War, Eni signed an agreement with the Soviet Union to be able to import crude oil from Russia at low prices.", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "On October 27, 1962, the plane in which Enrico Mattei was traveling exploded near Bascap\u00e8, while flying from Catania to Milan.

The 19th-century St. Gabriel of Our Lady of Sorrows was also born in Assisi. Around 1000 BC there was a wave of immigrants who settled in the valley from the headwaters of the Tiber to the Adriatic Sea, and also in the neighborhood of Assisi. They were the Umbri, who lived in small, fortified settlements on the plateau. From 450 BC, these settlements were gradually taken over by the Etruscans. The Romans took over central Italy after the Battle of Sentinum in 295 BC. They built the thriving municipium of Asisium on a series of steps on Monte Subasio. Roman remains can be found in Assisi: the city walls, the forum (now Piazza del Comune), a theater, an amphitheater, and the Temple of Minerva (now turned into the Church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva). In 1997, the remains of a Roman villa were also discovered in the form of several well-preserved rooms with a variety of frescoes and mosaics in a condition rarely found at outside sites such as Pompei. In 238 AD, Assisi was converted to Christianity by Bishop Rufino, who was martyred at Costano. According to tradition, his remains are buried in the Cathedral Church of San Rufino in Assisi.

The city, which remained within the confines of the Roman walls, began to expand beyond them in the 13th century. During this period, the city came under papal jurisdiction. The Rocca Maggiore, the imperial fortress on the hilltop above the city, which was looted by the people in 1189, was rebuilt in 1367 by order of the papal legate, Cardinal Gil de Albornoz. Assisi initially fell under Perugia and then under several totalitarian rulers such as Biordo Michelotti, Gian Galeazzo Visconti and his successor Francesco I Sforza, the dukes of Milan, Jacopo Piccinino, and Federico II da Montefeltro, ruler of Urbino. The city suffered a sharp decline due to the Black Death epidemic in 1348. Assisi again came under papal jurisdiction under Pope Pius II (1458-1464).

The site of Amarna includes several modern villages, as well as the archaeological site of a former capital built by the pharaoh Akhenaten of Ancient Egypt's 18th dynasty (c. 1353 BC). The region was occupied during the Roman Empire and early Christianity. Some structures from these periods have been found in excavations to the south of the city.

This site should be distinguished from Tell Amarna in Syria, an archaeological tell (\"mound\") from the Halaf period. The British Egyptologist, Sir John Gardner Wilkinson, visited Amarna in Egypt twice in the 1820s and identified it as Alabastron, following the sometimes contradictory descriptions of the Roman writers Plinius (On Stones) and Ptolemaeus (Geography), although he was uncertain about this identification and proposed Kom el-Ahmar (Nekhen) as an alternative location.

Squirrels have a relatively large brain. The ratio of brain size to body size in squirrels is the largest in living things, even beating humans. Squirrels were once separated from shrews and moon rats, which remained in the Insectivora, and moved into the Primates, which includes lorises, lionfish, monkeys and apes. This move was due to the squirrel's internal resemblance to the monkey, so it was considered an early primate group. However, according to the latest opinion based on molecular phylogeny studies, squirrels are now classified separately into the Scandentia; which together with the kubung (Dermoptera) and the Primates above, make up a group of animals called Euarchonta.

Before Sukracarya obtained the mertasanjiwani mantra, Indra sent his daughter Jayanti to thwart Sukracarya's asceticism. But Jayanti did not interfere with Sukracarya's asceticism. Instead, he served Sukracarya obediently for a thousand years. After a thousand years passed, Sukracarya obtained the mertasanjiwani mantra. At that moment he realized the presence of a woman who had been accompanying him to meditate faithfully. To return the favor, Sukracarya asked Jayanti's request, and she promised to fulfill it. Jayanti asked Sukracarya to marry her and live together, for ten years. From this marriage, Dewayani was born. The science of reviving the dead was known by Sukracarya so that if there was a dead giant, he would revive him.

A snood is a short length of line tied to the main line with a baited hook attached to the end of the snood. Hundreds or even thousands of hooks can be attached to a main line. However, according to the Big Indonesian Dictionary (KBBI), rawai is defined as a tool for catching fish made from stretched rope or rattan to which several hooks are attached. Rawai consists of a series of main ropes, buoy ropes, where on the main rope, at a certain distance there are several branch ropes that are shorter and smaller in diameter, and at the end of the branch rope is tied a branching fishing tool. One type, rawai layur, a device used to catch layur fish, consists of a float line, main line, branch line, barlen wire, float, sinker, fishing line, and swivel (kili- kili). The main line is used as a place to hang the branch line. While the branch rope is a rope that connects the barlen wire with the main line. Barlen wire serves to avoid breaking the branch rope due to layur bites. The buoy rope is the connection between the main line and the buoy. The buoy serves as a sign of where the kite fishing rod is operated. Weights are useful for keeping the fishing line from being carried too far from the fishing ground. Swivel serves to connect the main line with the buoy rope so that it is not easily tangled and can move freely (not entangled when operated).

Sundang is usually used as a traditional weapon by the Malay, Bugis and Sulu people. There are two types of sundang that are known for sure, namely sundang lipas in the form of a two-eyed sword and sundang in the form of a large kris whether it is hollow or not. Sundang is not used for stabbing like the nature of a kris, it is more about twisting, slashing and bulldozing. The size of the eye is larger and longer and somewhat heavier than a regular kris. Hulu sundang is also usually similar to a sword although it has its own characteristics. It is the sword of the sea people or the strait people, customarily used by the nakhoda or admiral class in ancient times. This weapon is popular in the southern Philippines, Borneo and Bugis, although there are sundang produced in Trengganu, Kelantan, Patani, Madura and Northern Peninsular Malaysia. The origin of Sundang is not known for certain, but it is certain that this weapon was used by the Suluk (Tausug) people for centuries. Keris Sundang is an adaptation of the Naga-patterned keris in the form of a sword commonly used in this archipelago. Historically, Sundang was brought by the Bugis Makassarese from Sulawesi to Riau and Tanah Melayu in the 17th century. Kalis or Keris Sundang is a traditional kris of Tausug since ancient times. Several types of Sundang such as Kalis Tulid (Straight), Kalis seku (Bersiku or berlok), Kalis Taluseku (Separa Lok) have become the pride of the Tausug people. Kedap or Keris Tausug is significantly different from the keris in the Land of Malay itself. The Tausug kris is larger and longer than the small and pointed Malay kris.

There are two common types of broadband, DSL and cable modems, which are capable of transferring 512 gbps or more, approximately 10000 Broadband Internet access became a fast-growing market in many areas in the early 2000s; one study found that broadband Internet usage in the United States grew from 6% in June 2000 to nearly 30% in 2003. Archived 2005-07-01 at the Wayback Machine. Some modern implementations of broadband have reached 20 Mbit/sec, several hundred times faster than the early Internet and less expensive; however, costs and performance vary across countries. The country with the highest penetration of broadband usage in the world is South Korea, where 23.17% (December 2003 data) of the population utilizes this type of connection. Broadband is often called high-speed internet, as it typically has a high data flow rate. Generally, connections to customers with speeds of 256 kbit/d (32KByte/d) or more are considered broadband internet. The International Telecommunication Union Standardization Sector (ITU-T) recommendation I.113 defines broadband as the capacity to transmit faster than the primary ISDN speed of 1.5 to 2 Mbit/s. The FCC definition of broadband is about 200 kbit/s in one direction, and advanced broadband is at least 200 kbit/s in both directions. The OECD defines broadband as 256 kbit/s in at least one direction and this speed is the most accepted worldwide.

As the bandwidth available to subscribers continues to increase, the market can expect that video on demand services delivered over the Internet will become increasingly popular, although they currently require specialized networks. The data rates in most broadband services are still insufficient to provide good quality video, as MPEG-2 still requires 6 Mbit/s for good results. The MPEG-4 format delivers high-quality video at 2 Mbit/s, at the tail end of current cable and ADSL modem capabilities. The Ogg Tarkin format is expected to deliver comparable performance. The standard technology in many places is DSL, followed by cable modems. Newer technologies for twisted pair telephone lines such as VDSL and fiber optic links. For areas not covered by cable services, many communities have started installing Wi-Fi networks. These links use a satellite in geostationary orbit to relay data from the satellite company to each subscriber. Satellite internet is one of the most expensive ways to get broadband internet access, but in rural areas it may be the only way. However, costs have been steadily decreasing in recent times and can compete with other high-speed options. These connections typically use the IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi radio system to connect distant points, but can also use other high-power radio communication systems.

Tzitzit are attached to the four corners of a cloth or prayer garment called a tallit or tallit katan. The Hebrew noun tzitzit is thought to be derived from the Semitic root N-TZ-H. The ending ith is a feminine word ending, used here to form a feminine singular noun. The original meaning is \"tufts\" or \"tufts\", as in the Book of Ezekiel when Ezekiel is picked up by an angel and carried with \"tufts\" (Hebrew tzitzit) of hair (Ezekiel 8:3). In English academic texts on Jewish ceremonial objects, the term is sometimes translated as show-fringe. In the Hebrew Bible, the singular form is used, but the feminine plural tzitziyot is found in later texts. The Septuagint translation of tzitzit is \"\u03ba\u03c1\u03ac\u03c3\u03c0\u03b5\u03b4\u03b1\" (kraspeda) in the plural or \"\u03ba\u03c1\u03ac\u03c3\u03c0\u03b5\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd\" (kraspedon) in the singular. The Torah states in the Book of Numbers 15:38, \"Speak to the children of Israel and tell them that they shall make tassels on the tassels of their garments throughout their generations, and in the tassels of the tassels shall be threaded a bluish-purple thread\". Wearing these tassels or tzitzit is also commanded in Deuteronomy 22:12 \"You shall make twisted cords on the four corners of your garments.\" \"Twisted cords\" here is translated from the Hebrew word: \u05d2\u05d3\u05dc\u05d9\u05dd (g\u0259-\u1e0fi-l\u00eem), which refers to the twisted part of the tzitzit. Tzitziyot are now attached to the tallit and tallit katan. The tallit katan itself is often referred to as tzitzit.

The part of the tzitzit that is twisted as a whole is called g'dil (English: braid, \"braid, twist\"; plural: g\u0259\u1e0fil\u00eem, as used in Deuteronomy 22:12), while the part that hangs freely is called anaf (English: fringe; \"fringe, edge\"). The tzitzit on each corner of the cloth is made of four strands of thread, which must be made with great care. The four strands are then inserted into the holes in the corners of the cloth and strung down so that they appear to be eight strands. (Usually each of the four strands is made of eight fine threads, known as kaful shemoneh). The four strands are inserted into a hole (or according to some sources, two holes) 1-2 inches (25 to 50 mm) away from the corner of the cloth. There are many customs as to how to tie tzitzit. The Talmud explains that Scripture requires a top knot (kesher elyon) and a bandage of three loops (hulya). The Talmud commands that between 7 and 13 hulyot be tied, and that \"one of them must begin and end with the color of the cloth.\" As for the knotting between the hulyot, the Talmud does not elaborate, and the poskim (Jewish legal authorities) have interpreted this requirement in various ways.

The word \"vanilla\" is derived from the Spanish word vaina, which means \"pod\", because the shape of the vanilla fruit is a pod. The plant was first cultivated by the Aztec people of Mesoamerica who called the plant tlilxochitl. Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s brought vanilla along with chocolate to Europe after his exploration of the Americas. Vanilla was used by the Mesoamerican people as one of the main spices for chocolate drinks. Early efforts to cultivate vanilla were difficult because vanilla requires Melipona bees, which are only found in Central America. A Belgian botanist was the first to discover this and tried to find a way to artificially pollinate vanilla, but his efforts were unsatisfactory. A simple method of artificial pollination was discovered by a slave on the island of R\u00e9union, Edmond Albius, in 1841 and led to vanilla becoming widely cultivated. The vanilla plant itself entered Indonesia starting in 1819 brought by a Dutch botanist named Marchal and first planted in the Bogor Botanical Garden. There are three main species of vanilla currently developed, and all of them are plants brought from Central America. Vanilla planifolia is cultivated in Madagascar, R\u00e9union, and other tropical regions around the Indian Ocean; Vanilla tahitensis, cultivated in the South Pacific, and Vanilla pompona cultivated in the western Indian Ocean, Central America, and Latin America.

Vanilla is widely used for its pods for spices and also for its aroma. The plant is widely used in the food industry (60%), cosmetics (33%), and as an aromatherapy ingredient (7%). Vanilla is traditionally used for the treatment of several diseases such as dysmenorrhea, fever, hysteria, dyspepsia, prevention of dental caries, treatment of toothache, cough, and stomachache. The plant is known to have antispasmodic, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic effects. Like most other orchids, vanilla grows by requiring other plants as a means of plant propagation or protection from direct sunlight. Vanilla grows optimally at a shade ratio of about 50-60%. These shade plants should be fast-growing, easy to prune, have leaves that do not fall easily, be pest-resistant, and have deep root systems such as lamtoro or dadap. In Reunion, these plants are maintained together with agroforestry. Vanilla is actually capable of self-pollination or is assisted by bees and hummingbirds. However, pollination is difficult due to the large size of vanilla pollen, so pollination is usually done by humans and is very labor-intensive. The plant only flowers for a day, so plantation workers have to check every day to carry out artificial pollination. In addition, the harvesting and packaging process is also still done by human labor, making it very inefficient. This is what makes vanilla plantations labor-intensive. Vanilla can grow at an altitude of 0-1500 meters above sea level. In its native region, vanilla grows in tropical rainforests with rainfall of around 1500-3000 mm/year with temperatures of around 15-30oC and high humidity. Rainfall and temperature are the determining factors for vanilla growth.

Kertabhumi is known as the king of Majapahit after defeating his uncle, Suraprabhawa (the 10th king of Majapahit), and as the father of Raden Patah. According to Pararaton, in 1468, Bhre Kertabhumi rebelled against Suraprabhawa (Singhawikramawardhana), Rajasawardhana's younger brother, because he was Rajasawardhana's son, who felt more entitled to the Majapahit throne than his uncle.

In Malacca and its surroundings and even in other areas of Malaysia, communities of Minangkabau, Javanese, Banjar, Bawean (in Malacca commonly called Boyan) and other ethnicities from the archipelago can be found. Since Malacca was a trading center at that time, it is understandable that economic factors drove people to migrate to Malacca.

At first, trade in Barus was dominated by Tamils from India, who made Barus a kind of Indian colony to control trade in natural products from Sumatra and the archipelago in general. The Tamil domination of trade in Barus was only broken by Minangkabau traders around the 14th and 15th centuries with the support of the Pagaruyung kingdom.

Both transsexual women and transgender women can experience what is called gender dysphoria, a condition that arises from a mismatch between their gender identity and the sex they were assigned at birth. Gender dysphoria can include gender roles, primary and secondary sexual characteristics associated with one's gender. The condition can cause a strong sense of anxiety or make it difficult for individuals to perform daily activities. Some trans people may judge that their gender transition is complete. Therefore, they prefer the word \"woman\" and see the word \"transgender\" as a term that should only be used for people who have not fully transitioned. Others may also not want to be seen as \"transwomen\" given society's tendency to differentiate between \"foreign\" people who fall outside the sex/gender binary. For these reasons, many see the use of a space between the words \"woman\" and \"trans\" as important because the word \"trans\" is thus only used as an adjective that is denoting one type of woman among other types of women.

Garut Regency, which is geographically close to Bandung City as the capital of West Java province, is a buffer and hinterland area for the development of the Greater Bandung area. Therefore, Garut Regency has a strategic position in supplying the needs of residents of Bandung City and Regency, as well as playing a role in controlling environmental balance. In general, the climate in Garut Regency can be categorized as a humid tropical climate because it includes types Af to Am of the \"Koppen climate classification\". Based on the secondary data study, the climate and weather in Garut Regency are influenced by three main factors, namely the monsoonal circulation pattern, the mountainous regional topography in the central part of West Java; and the topographic elevation in Bandung. Average annual rainfall around Garut ranges from 2,589mm with 9 wet months and 3 dry months, while around the mountainous areas it reaches 3500-4000mm. Monthly temperature variations range from 24\u00b0C - 27\u00b0C.

Tetracyclines are commonly used to treat acne (acne vulgaris), cholera, brucellosis, bubonic plague, malaria, and syphilis. Tetracycline is sold under several trade names such as Sumycin, Terramycin, Tetracyn, Panmycin, and others. Actisite is a type of periodontal tetracycline that is shaped like a fiber thread used in dentistry applications. Tetracyclines are also used to produce several semi-synthetic derivative compounds known as tetracycline antibiotics. Tetracyclines are commonly produced by some members of the genus Streptomyces and are commonly used antibiotics for human medicine. However, tetracyclines are also often used for the treatment of animals such as poultry. Tetracyclines are broad-spectrum antibiotics because they inhibit the growth of almost all Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Tetracycline is currently not included in the aminoglycoside class of antibiotics and is classified separately as the Terracycline group, in which there are Oxytetracycline, Doxycycline, and Tetracycline itself. Its mode of action is to inhibit or inhibit protein synthesis in bacteria by interfering with the function of the 30S subunit of the ribosome. Tetracycline was first introduced in 1948, and attention to tooth discoloration in children was reported in 1956. This undesirable event most likely occurs during the calcification process of the teeth, which is completed by the age of 8 years. Routine use of tetracycline in children younger than 8 years of age is not recommended because of the strong association between this drug and permanent tooth discoloration. Proposed mechanism: Tetracycline is bound to cations, which may lead to the formation of tetracycline-calcium complexes that are irreversibly (not reversible) deposited in developing bones and teeth. Once calcification is complete, no further calcium exchange occurs, which limits the ability of tetracycline to deposit onto teeth.", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "The level of tetracycline exposure, the amount of administration, the total dose and the exact timing of tooth development may influence the risk of this occurring. Staining may vary by drug type, doxycycline (another member of the tetracycline class) potentially having the lowest incidence due to its decreased affinity for binding calcium compared to other tetracyclines. Volovitz and colleagues reported no cases of tooth discoloration in a study of 31 children (mean age 4 years) treated with doxycycline for atypical pneumonia. In some infections that are difficult to treat with limited alternative therapies, tetracyclines can be efficacious and relatively safe in children less than 8 years of age. Tetracyclines are useful for the treatment of Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) and ehrlichiosis, separate rickettsial diseases that can mimic RMSF and should be treated empirically when RMSF is suspected. In addition, a retrospective study showed that chloramphenicol, the only other antibiotic with activity against RMSF, may be less effective than doxycycline, with a mortality rate of 8.9% versus 1.6% in the doxycycline group. Given the adverse effects of chloramphenicol, including peripheral neuropathy and aplastic anemia, tetracycline may be considered a better option for RMSF even in children under 8 years old. The structure of tetracycline consists of four rings joined by two conjugated bonds. Substitutions to the rings allow for improved pharmacokinetic properties and differences in their spectrum of activity against bacteria. Tetracyclines were initially used to treat infections with Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, as well as some protozoa. In 1948, tetracycline compounds were originally obtained from Streptomyces aureofaciens (clortetracycline) and Streptomyces rimosus (oxytetracycline). After 1960, the parent substance tetracycline began to be made entirely synthetically, followed by oxy- and -chlor derivatives and the long-acting compounds doxycycline and minocycline.", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "The Domain Naming System (English: (Domain Name System, DNS) is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet or private networks. It associates various information with domain names assigned to each participating entity. Most notably, it translates more easily memorized domain names to numerical IP addresses that are required to locate and identify computer services and devices by their underlying network protocols. By providing a worldwide distributed directory service, the Domain Name System has been an essential component of Internet functionality since 1985. The Domain Name System delegates responsibility for assigning domain names and mapping those names to Internet resources by designating an official name server for each domain. Network administrators can delegate authority over sub-domains of the allocated name space to other name servers. This mechanism provides a distributed and fault-tolerant service and is designed to avoid a large single central database. The Domain Name System also defines the technical functionality of the database services at its core. It defines the DNS protocol, a detailed specification of the data structures and data communication exchanges used in the DNS, as part of the Internet Protocol Suite.google-site-verification=ci4h4dbiXUVXKlvby8T9MZqYpNt6k9xYNz9GGmomUooThe Internet has two main name spaces, the domain name hierarchy and the Internet Protocol (IP) address space. The Domain Name System maintains the domain name hierarchy and provides translation services between it and the address space. Internet name servers and communication protocols implement the Domain Name System. DNS name servers are servers that store DNS records for domains; a DNS name server responds with answers to queries against its database. The most common types of records stored in the DNS database are for Start of Authority (SOA), IP addresses (A and AAAA), SMTP mail exchangers (MX), name servers (NS), pointers for reverse DNS lookups (PTR), and domain name aliases (CNAME).", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "Although not intended as a general purpose database, DNS has been extended over time to store records for other types of data for automated lookups, such as DNSSEC records, or for human queries such as responsible person (RP) records. As a general purpose database, DNS has also been used in the fight against unsolicited email (spam) by storing real-time blackhole lists (RBLs). DNS databases are traditionally stored in structured text files, zone files, but other database systems are common. An analogy often used to explain the Domain Name System is that it functions as a phone book for the Internet by translating human-friendly computer host names to IP addresses. For example, the domain name www.example.com translates to addresses 93.184.216.34 (IPv4) and 2606: 2800: 220: 1: 248: 1893: 25c8: 1946 (IPv6). DNS can be updated quickly and transparently, allowing the location of services on the network to change without affecting the end user, who continues to use the same hostname. Users take advantage of this when they use meaningful Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) and email addresses without having to know how the computer actually finds the service. Using a simpler and more memorable name in place of the numerical address of the host, goes back to the ARPANET era. Stanford Research Institute (now SRI International) maintained a text file called HOSTS.TXT that mapped host names to the numerical addresses of computers on the ARPANET. Elizabeth Feinler developed and maintained the first ARPANET directory. Maintenance of the numeric addresses, called the Assigned Number List, was handled by Jon Postel at the University of Southern California's Information Sciences Institute (ISI), whose team worked closely with SRI. By the early 1980s, maintaining a single, centralized host table had become slow and unwieldy and the emerging network needed an automated naming system to address technical and personnel issues.", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "Coordinates: 8\u00b013\u203209\u2033S 124\u00b031\u203210\u2033E / 8.21917\u00b0S 124.51944\u00b0E / -8.21917; 124.51944 Alor Regency is a regency in the province of East Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia. The capital of Alor is in Kalabahi. The population of Alor is approximately 213,994 people (2021), while its area is 2,928.88 km\u00b2. The regency is an archipelago and is crossed by international trade shipping lanes to the Pacific Ocean. In 2006, the district's PAD amounted to IDR 13 billion with an economic growth rate of 5.9% and a per capita income of IDR 1,200,000. According to stories circulating in the Alor community, the oldest kingdoms in Alor Regency are the Abui kingdom in the interior of the Alor mountains and the Munaseli kingdom on the eastern tip of Pantar island. Once upon a time, these two kingdoms were involved in a Magic War. They used magical powers to destroy each other. Munaseli sent bees to Abui, while Abui sent hurricanes and fire to Munaseli. The war was eventually won by Munaseli. It is said that the skull of the Abui king who led the war is still preserved in a cave in Mataru. The next kingdoms established were the Pandai kingdom located near the Munaseli kingdom and the Bali Flower Kingdom centered in Alor Besar. Munaseli and Pandai, who were neighbors, were eventually also involved in a war which caused Munaseli to ask for help from the king of Majapahit kingdom, considering that they had previously lost the war against Abui.citation needed] Around the early 1300s, a detachment of Majapahit royal aid soldiers arrived in Munaseli but all they found was the ruins of Munaseli kingdom, while the inhabitants had fled to various places in Alor and its surroundings. Many of these Majapahit soldiers eventually decided to settle in Munaseli, so it is not surprising that many Munaseli people today have Javanese looks.", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "This event of sending Majapahit soldiers to Munaseli is the reason why Galiau (Pantar) is mentioned in Mpu Prapanca's Negarakartagama, written during Majapahit's heyday (1367). The same book also mentions Galiau Watang Lema or the coastal areas of the archipelago. Galiau consisted of five kingdoms, namely Kui and Bunga Bali in Alor and Blagar, Pandai and Baranua in Pantar. This alliance of 5 coastal kingdoms is believed to have a close relationship with each other, even their kings claim to have the same ancestors. The founders of the 5 coastal kingdoms were the 5 sons of Mau Wolang from Majapahit and they grew up in Pandai. The eldest of them ruled the area. They also had trade relations, even blood relations with a similar alliance that stretched from Solor to Lembata. Trade routes were built not only between them but also all the way to Sulawesi, with some even saying that the small islands of northern Australia belonged to these trade routes. Perhaps that's why some time ago a number of young men from Alor Pantar made a voyage to the island of Pasir in northern Australia. The first report of foreigners about Alor dated January 8-25, 1522 was Pigafetta, a writer with the crew of the Victorian fleet had anchored at Pureman beach, Southwest Alor District. They were on their way back to Europe after sailing around the world and after Magelhaen, the leader of the Victorian fleet was killed in the Philippines. Pigafetta also mentioned Galiau in his diary. His erroneous observation was that the islanders of Alor had wide ears that could be folded up to serve as pillows while sleeping. Pigafetta had clearly misunderstood the traditional umbrellas of the Alor people made from woven pandanus leaves.", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "Life is a feature that distinguishes physical objects that have biological processes (i.e. living organisms) from physical objects that do not have them, either because those functions have ceased (because they are dead) or because they never had those functions and are classified as inanimate. The science concerned with the study of life is biology. Life is present in many forms of organisms on Earth, such as plants, animals, fungi, protists, archaea and bacteria. Living organisms metabolize, maintain homeostasis, have the ability to grow, respond to stimuli, reproduce, and-through natural selection-adapt to their environment in successive generations. More complex living organisms can communicate through various means. The common traits of these organisms are carbon- and water-based cells, with complex organization and heritable genetic information. Abiogenesis is a natural process when life arises from non-living matter, such as simple organic compounds. The current scientific hypothesis explains that the transition from non-living to living entities was not a single event, but a gradual process of increasing complexity. Life on Earth first appeared 4.28 billion years ago, after the oceans formed 4.41 billion years ago, and shortly after the Earth formed 4.54 billion years ago. The earliest known life forms are bacterial microfossils. Researchers generally think that life today originated in the RNA world, although RNA-based life may not have been the first life ever.

Since the beginning, organisms on Earth have experienced environmental changes on geological timescales. They have also adapted to survive in most ecosystems and conditions. Some microorganisms called extremophiles grow in extreme environments (physically or geochemically) that are detrimental to most other organisms on Earth. Cells are considered the structural and functional unit of life. There are two types of cells, prokaryotes and eukaryotes, which consist of a cytoplasm enclosed in a membrane and containing many biomolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids. Cells reproduce through cell division, a process in which a parent cell divides into two or more daughter cells. In the past, there have been many attempts to define what constitutes \"life\" through outdated concepts such as odic force, hylemorphism, spontaneous generation, and vitalism, which have now been refuted by biological discoveries. Aristotle is considered the first person to classify organisms. Carolus Linnaeus later introduced the binomial nomenclature system to classify species. Later, new groups and categories of life were discovered, such as cells and microorganisms, which revised the structure of relationships among living organisms. Although life is currently only known on Earth, scientists speculate on the existence of extraterrestrial life. Meanwhile, artificial life is a computer simulation or man-made reconstruction of any aspect of life, often used to examine systems related to natural life.

Fires have positive effects such as stimulating growth and maintaining various ecological systems. Negatively, fires are harmful to life and property, causing atmospheric pollution and water contamination. If fires remove protective vegetation, heavy rains can lead to increased soil erosion by water. In addition, when vegetation is burned, the nitrogen it contains is released into the atmosphere, unlike elements such as potassium and phosphorus which remain in the ash and are quickly recycled into the soil.

The term deforestation is often misinterpreted to describe logging activities where all the trees in an area are cut down. However, in temperate regions where there is sufficient moisture, the felling of all trees - in accordance with sustainable forestry implementation measures - is more accurately referred to as 'youth harvesting'. In such areas, natural establishment by forest stands will not normally occur without disturbance, either natural or human-induced. Moreover, the consequences of harvesting are often similar to natural disturbances, including biodiversity loss following the destruction of naturally occurring rainforests. Deforestation can occur for a variety of reasons: the trees or charcoal obtained from the forest can be used or sold for fuel or as timber alone, while the land can be used as pasture for livestock, plantations for merchandise, or for settlements. Felling trees without sufficient reforestation can lead to habitat destruction, loss of biodiversity and aridity. Logging also adversely affects the biosecuestration of carbon dioxide from the air. Areas that have been clear-cut usually experience severe soil erosion and often become deserts.

Such changes have also occurred in the past and can be proven through research of the fossil record. However, net deforestation rates are no longer increasing among countries with a GDP per capita of at least US$4,600. Much of today's deforestation is due to abuses of power among government agencies, inequities in the distribution of wealth and power, population growth and population explosion, and urbanization. Globalization is often seen as another root cause of deforestation, although some of the good effects of globalization (the arrival of new labour, capital, merchandise and ideas) have promoted the restoration of local forests. In 2000, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) found that \"the role of population dynamics in local circumstances can vary from very influential to not influential at all,\" and that deforestation can occur due to \"population pressure and economic, societal and technological bottlenecks.\" The deterioration of forest ecosystems can also stem from economic drivers that emphasize the benefits of forest conversion over forest preservation. Many important forest uses have no market and therefore no economic value to forest owners or the communities that depend on forests for their well-being. From the perspective of developing countries, the loss of forest benefits (as carbon sinks or biodiversity reserves), when most of the remaining trees are sent to developed countries, is unfair because there is not enough remuneration for these services.

Meanwhile, Kalimantan and Eastern Indonesia were under the authority of the Japanese kaigun (Navy) and they did not allow the establishment of an independence preparation institution. At the end of the Pacific war, Japan's defeat became clear. On September 7, 1944, Japanese Prime Minister General Kuniaki Koiso announced that Indonesia would be liberated at a later date, after achieving final victory in the war that Japan called the \"Greater East Asia War\". In this way, Japan hoped that the Allied forces would be welcomed by the Indonesian people as invaders of their country, so on March 1, 1945, the head of the Japanese military occupation government in Java, General Kumakichi Harada, announced the establishment of a special body in charge of investigating efforts to prepare for Indonesian independence, called \"Badan Penyelidik Usaha-Usaha Persiapan Kemerdekaan Indonesia\" (BPUPK). The formation of BPUPK was also to investigate, study and prepare other important matters related to governance issues in order to establish an independent Indonesian state. The BPUPK was officially formed on April 29, 1945, coinciding with the birthday of the Japanese emperor, Emperor Hirohito. Dr. Kanjeng Raden Tumenggung (K.R.T.)

Perth is part of the South West Land Division of Western Australia, the majority of the Perth metropolitan area is located on the Swan Coastal Plain. The first inhabited areas are on the Swan River, while the main business center and port of Fremantle are located on the waterfront. The Perth Metropolitan Area covers 30 local government areas, ranging from Two Rocks in the north to Rockingham in the south. Perth was originally founded by Captain James Stirling in 1829 as the administrative center of the Swan River Colony. It was elevated to city status in 1856, then to Lord Mayor in 1929. The city took its name from Perth, Scotland, due to the influence of Sir George Murray, Member of Parliament for Perthshire and Secretary of State for War and Colonies. The city's population increased significantly due to the Western Australian Gold Rush of the late 19th century, a massive emigration from the eastern colonies of Australia. When Australia participated in World War II, Fremantle served as a submarine base for the Pacific War. As the capital of Western Australia, Parliament and the Supreme Court are located within the city, as well as Government House, home to the Governor of Western Australia. Perth was ranked 8th by the Economist Intelligence Unit in August 2015 as the most liveable city, and classified as an alpha city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network in 2010.

He was both the leader and the youngest of the first generation Titans. Kronos was the son of Uranus (heaven) and Gaia (earth). Kronos defeated his father and ruled the world in the Golden Age until he was finally coup d'\u00e9tat by his own children, then locked up in Tartaros. Kronos is usually depicted with a scythe, which he used when defeating his father, Uranus. In the city of Athens, on the twelfth day of the month Hekatombaion, a festival was held for Kronos called Kronia. This festival was a celebration of the harvest, and indicates that Kronos was considered the protector of the harvest. This is thought to be due to his association with the Golden Age. In Roman mythology, Kronos was identified with the god Saturn. Hellenistic scholars in Alexandria during the Renaissance equated Kronos with Khronos, the god and personification of time who wielded a large scythe. H. J. Rose, in A Handbook of Greek Mythology, states that the name Kronos is not of Greek origin. A theory debated in the 19th century, states that Kronos is related to the word \"horned\", suggesting a Semitic origin, qrn/krn. Robert Brown states in The Great Dionysiak Myth, 1877. \"Kronos denotes \"he who has horns\", an opinion already proposed by Alexander Hislop in The Two Babylons; or, The papal worship proved to be the worship of Nimrod and his wife, with the note \"From krn, a horn\". Robert Brown also points out Semitic usage, for example in the Hebrew Bible, that qeren denotes \"power\".

Gaia was angry at her husband's actions. Gaia then made a stone sickle and gathered the Titans to persuade them to castrate Uranus. Only Kronos dared to do so, so Gaia gave the scythe to Kronos and hid Kronos. While Uranus was having sex with Gaia, Kronos suddenly appeared and cut Uranus' genitals with his scythe. Kronos then threw Uranus' testicles into the sea. Uranus was in great pain and died (another opinion says Uranus was lifted off the earth forever). From the blood (in other versions, semen) of Uranus that fell to earth, the Gigants, the Erinya, and the Meliai were created. Meanwhile, Uranus' testicles floated in the ocean and were covered in foam until the goddess Aphrodite was born from them. In another version of this myth, Kronos overthrew the rule of the evil Ofion. Kronos is thus seen as liberating the world from the cruelty of Ofion. The Titans then took control of the world with Kronos as their leader. Kronos himself was married to Rea. The reign of Kronos is referred to as the Golden Age because at that time humans lived in an orderly manner and obeyed the applicable laws, people did good deeds and there was no crime. But Kronos did not release the Kiklops and Hekatonkheire from their confinement. Instead, he increased the guard by ordering the dragon Kampe to keep them from escaping. Gaia and Uranus predicted that Kronos would be defeated by his own children, just as Kronos had done to his father. To avoid the prophecy, Kronos swallowed all the children born by Rea.

According to Huygens' principle, each point on the light wave front can be regarded as a secondary source of spherical waves. This wave propagates outward with the characteristic speed of the wave. The waves emitted by all points on the wavefront interfere with each other to produce traveling waves. Huygens' principle also applies to electromagnetic waves. Fresnel diffraction is a wave pattern at point (x,y,z) with the equation: where: In scalar diffraction theory (en:scalar diffraction theory), Fraunhofer diffraction is a wave pattern that occurs at a long distance (en:far field) according to the Fresnel diffraction integral equation as follows: The above equation shows that the wave pattern in scalar Fresnel diffraction becomes planar in Fraunhofer diffraction due to the distance of the observation plane from the obstacle plane. A long slit of infinitesimal width diffracts the incident light beam into a circular wave array, and the wavefront escaping from the slit is a cylindrical wave with uniform intensity. In general, for a monochromatic complex planar wave \u03a8\u2032{\\displaystyle \\Psi^{\\prime }} with wavelength &lambda passing through a single slit of width d lying in the x\u2032-y\u2032 plane, the diffraction occurring in the radial direction r can be calculated by Eq: assuming the coordinate axis is exactly at the center of the slit, x\u2032 will have values from -d/2{\\displaystyle -d/2\\,} to +d/2{\\displaystyle +d/2\\,}, and y\u2032 from 0 to \u221e{\\displaystyle \\infty}. The distance r from the slit is of the form: A slit with a width exceeding the wavelength will have many point sources (en:point source) spread evenly along the width of the slit. The diffracted light at a given angle is the result of interference from each point source and if the relative phase of this interference varies by more than 2\u03c0, minima and maxima will be seen in the diffracted light.", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "Maxima and minima are the results of constructive and destructive wave interference at interference maxima. Fresnel diffraction/short range diffraction that occurs in a slit with a width of four times the wavelength, light from a point source at the top end of the slit will destructively interfere with a point source at the center of the slit. The distance between the two point sources is \u03bb/2{\\displaystyle \\lambda /2}. The deduction equation from the observation of the distance between each destructive point source is: The first minima that occurs at the minimum angle &theta is: The long-range diffraction for these observations can be calculated based on the Fraunhofer diffraction integral equation to be: where the function sinc is sinc(x) = sin(px)/(px) if x ? 0, and sinc(0) = 1. In quantum mechanics, the double-slit experiment performed by Thomas Young showed the inseparable nature of light as a wave and a particle. A coherent light source shining on an obstacle plane with two slits will form a wave interference pattern in the form of bright and dark bands of light on the observation plane, however, on the observation plane, light is found to be absorbed as discrete particles called photons. Bright bands of light on the plane of observation occur due to constructive interference, where the crest of a wave (en:crest) interferes with the crest of another wave, forming maxima. Dark bands of light occur when a wave crest interferes with a wave base (en:trough) and becomes a minima. Constructive interference occurs when: where this equation is an approximation for certain conditions. More detailed mathematical equations of double-slit interference in the context of quantum mechanics are described in Englert-Greenberger duality. Compound slit diffraction (en:Diffraction grating) can be mathematically seen as the interference of many point light sources, under the simplest conditions, i.e. those that occur in two slits with the Fraunhofer approximation, the difference in distance between the two slits can be seen in the observation plane as follows: With the calculation of maxima: And the minima equation: For an incident ray that forms an angle \u03b8i with respect to the obstruction plane, the maxima calculation becomes: The diffracted light from a compound slit can be calculated by summing the diffraction that occurs at each slit in the form of convolution of the diffraction and interference patterns.", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "Glaukos (Greek: \u0393\u03bb\u03b1\u1fe6\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2) is a god of the sea in Greek mythology.

After eating it, he turned into a sea god. His appearance also changed. His legs turned into fish tails and fins appeared on his body. As a result, since then, Glaukos had to live in the sea. Glaukos did not like his change in appearance at first, but the other sea gods welcomed him and accepted him as a new member of the sea gods. Glaukos also learned the art of divination from the other sea gods. Glaukos fell in love with a nymph named Skilla. But Skilla was afraid of Glaukos' appearance and always avoided him.

Eicosanoids are a sub-category of oxylipins, which are oxidized fatty acids of diverse carbon units in length, and are distinguished from other oxylipins by their tremendous importance as cell signaling molecules. Eicosanoids function in diverse physiological systems and pathological processes such as: promoting or inhibiting inflammation, allergy, fever, and other immune responses; regulating pregnancy abortion and normal labor; contributing to pain perception; regulating cell growth; controlling blood pressure; and modulating regional flow of blood to tissues. In performing these roles, eicosanoids most often act as autocrine signaling agents to affect their cell of origin or as paracrine signaling agents to affect cells near their cell of origin.

Hummingbirds fall into nine main clades: topazes, hermits, mangoes, brilliants, coquettes, Patagona, mountain gems, bees, and emeralds, which define their relationship with nectar-bearing plants and the birds that continue to spread into new geographic regions. While all hummingbirds depend on floral nectar to fuel their high metabolism and soaring flight, coordinated changes in flower and bill shape stimulated the formation of new hummingbird species and new plant species. Because of this remarkable evolutionary pattern, as many as 140 hummingbird species can coexist in a given region, such as the Andes range. The hummingbird evolutionary tree suggests the hummingbird's ancestors were separate from insectivorous birds of prey (family Apodidae) and tree birds (family Hemiprocnidae) about 42 million years ago, probably in Eurasia. One of the main evolutionary factors appears to have been altered taste receptors that allowed hummingbirds to forage for nectar. By 22 million years ago the ancestral species of today's hummingbirds became established in South America, where environmental conditions stimulated further diversification. The Andes Mountains appear to have been a rich environment for hummingbird evolution as diversification occurred alongside an increase in mountain altitude over the last 10 million years.", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "Hummingbirds remain in a dynamic diversification inhabiting ecological regions across South America, North America and the Caribbean, exhibiting a growing evolutionary radiation. Within the same geographic region, hummingbird petals co-evolved with groups of nectar-bearing plants, influencing pollination mechanisms. The same is true for the sword-eyed hummingbird (Ensifera ensifera), one of the most morphologically extreme evolved species, with one of the major food crops (Passiflora section Tacsonia). Hummingbirds show sexual dimorphism according to Rensch's rule, where males are smaller than females in small-bodied species, and males are larger than females in large-bodied species. The extent of this sexual size difference varies among hummingbird flocks. For example, the Mellisugini clade exhibits large size dimorphism, with females larger than males. In contrast, the Lophomithini clade displays very small size dimorphism; males and females are similar in size. Sexual dimorphism in beak size and shape is also present among male and female hummingbirds, where in many clades, females have longer, curved beaks used to reach nectar from flowers. For males and females of similar size, females tend to have larger bills. Sexual size and beak differences are likely to have evolved due to constraints imposed by male hummingbirds to perform complex aerial maneuvers to attract females. Males tend to be smaller than females, allowing conservation of energy for competitive foraging. Thus, sexual selection favors smaller male hummingbirds. Female hummingbirds tend to be larger, which means they require more energy. With longer bills that allow for more effective reach into the crevices of tall flowers for nectar, females are better at foraging, obtaining flower nectar, and supporting the energy requirements of a larger body size.", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": " Sauber Formula One Engineering (hereafter referred to as Sauber or Team Sauber F1) is a Swiss Formula 1 team and constructor.

Under the guidance of BMW, the team made rapid progress and was even able to become one of the top teams with the best result of a 1-2 victory at the 2008 Canadian Grand Prix. Since BMW's decision to withdraw from F1 at the end of 2009, it has been widely reported that the Sauber Original team will return to the F1 arena. The news finally came true on December 3, 2009 when Peter Sauber officially took over the team and returned to compete in F1 starting from the 2010 season. Their drivers for now (2013) are Nico Hulkenberg and Esteban Gutierrez. The 2010 season Sauber team continued to compete under the name BMW Sauber even though at that time they no longer had anything to do with BMW. This was done because Sauber was still bound by the Concorde Agreement contract that they had signed since 2007 when they came down under the name BMW Sauber. Midway through the 2010 season Peter Sauber then proposed a name change to the Formula 1 commission which was then approved by Bernie Ecclestone. However, the FIA then decided that Sauber could only change their name as a constructor in early 2011. The Sauber team has been involved in motorsport since 1967 through Peter Sauber who acted as a driver at the 24 Hours of Le Mans.

In 1981, Sauber made a breakthrough in the world of motorsport by producing a special version of the BMW M1 and won the Nurburging 1000 Km in the same year. The result made Sauber focus more seriously on racing. In 1983, he switched to a Mercedes-Benz engine with turbocharge power. The technology developed by Sauber then received attention from Mercedes-Benz and eventually offered a partnership that resulted in the World Sportscar Championship Group 6 champion cars, the C9 (1989) and C11 (1990). However, the alliance with the German manufacturer was severed in 1990 because Mercedes wanted to develop its own racing engine and did not agree with Sauber's plans to enter Formula 1. Several drivers were coached by the Sauber team before they entered the F1 world including Heinz-Harald Frentzen, Michael Schumacher, Karl Wendlinger and also several former F1 veterans such as Jochen Mass, Jean-Louis Schlesser and Mauro Baldi. Stepping on 1993 Sauber has a strong determination to be able to step down as a constructor in the F1 arena. They then tried to re-establish a partnership with Mercedes-Benz.

He was the son of Kimon Koalemos, an Olympic racer, and the father of Kimon, a famous Athenian statesman. Miltiades was a well-born Athenian, and considered himself a member of the Aiakides, as well as a prominent member of the Philaid dynasty. He came of age during the Tyrant Peisistratos. His family was prominent, due to their success in the Olympic chariot races. Plutarkhos states that Kimon, Miltiades' father, was known as \"Koalemos\", meaning \"simpleton\", because he had a rough reputation around the edges, but his 3 consecutive chariot racing victories in the Olympics made him popular, so popular in fact that, Herodotos states, Peisistratos killed him out of jealousy. Miltiades was named after his maternal father's half-brother, Old Miltiades, who was also a winner at the Olympic chariot races. Miltiades' son Kimon was a great Athenian figure of the 470s and 460s BC. His daughter Elpinice is remembered for her confrontation with Perikles, as recorded by Plutarkhos. In around 555 BC, Old Miltiades left Athens to establish a colony in Thrakik\u00e9 Chers\u00f3nesos (now the Gallipoli Peninsula), establishing himself as a semi-autonomous Tyrant under Athenian protection. Meanwhile, contrary to what one might expect from a man whose father was rumored to have been murdered by the city leaders, Young Miltiades rose through the Athenian ranks to become the nameless arch\u014dn Ep\u014dnymos under the rule of the Peisistratid tyrant Hippias in 524/23 BC.

When men of rank from Chersonese came to console him, he imprisoned them. He then ensured his strength by hiring 500 soldiers. He also allied himself with King Olorus of Trakia by marrying his daughter, Hegesipyle. In about 513 BC, Darius I, king of Persia, led a large army into the area, forcing the Chersonese Tracians into submission and making Miltiades a vassal of the Persian government. Miltiades joined Darius' northern expedition against the Scythians, and was left with other Greek officers to guard a bridge across the Danube River, which Darius had crossed into Scythia. Miltiades later claimed that he had tried to convince the other officers to destroy the bridge and leave Darius and his soldiers to die, but the others were afraid, and Darius was able to cross, although some historians are skeptical of this statement. When the king heard about the planned sabotage, Miltiades' reign became contentious and he had to flee around 511/510 BC. Miltiades joined the Ionian Revolt in 499 BC against Persian rule, returning to Chersonese around 496 BC. He established friendly relations with Athens by capturing the islands of Lemnos and Imbros, which he then conveyed to Athens, which had ancient claims to these lands. The Ionian revolt collapsed in 494 BC, and in 492 BC Miltiades and his family fled to Athens with five ships to escape the Persian attack.n 1] The Athens to which Miltiades returned was no longer a tyranny, but had overthrown the Peisistratids and become a Democracy 15 years earlier.", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "Wayang (from Javanese: \ua9ae\ua9aa\ua981, translit. wayang, har. 'shadow') is a traditional performing art native to Indonesia that originated and flourished on the islands of Java and Bali. UNESCO, the United Nations cultural organization, on November 7, 2003 designated wayang as Indonesia's most famous shadow puppet show, a World Heritage of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity. Until recently, the earliest records that could be obtained about wayang performances came from the Balitung Inscription in the 10th Century. In 903 AD, an inscription called the Balitung (Mantyasih) Inscription was created by King Balitung of the Sanjaya Dynasty, from the Ancient Medang Kingdom. They state Si Galigi Mawayang Buat Hyang Macarita Bimma Ya Kumara, which means 'Galigi held a puppet show for the gods by taking the story of Bima Kumara'. It seems that certain features of traditional puppet theater have survived since then. Galigi was a traveling artist who was asked to perform for a special royal occasion. At that event he performed the story of the hero Bima from the Mahabharata. Mpu Kanwa, the court poet of Airlangga of the Kahuripan Kingdom, wrote in 1035 AD in his kakawin Arjunawiwaha: santo\u1e63\u00e2h\u0115l\u0115tan k\u0115lir sira sak\u00eang sang hyang Jagatk\u0101ra\u1e47a, which means, \"He is steadfast and only the puppet screen is far from the 'Mover of the World'.\" Kelir is the Javanese word for wayang screen, a poem that eloquently compares real life to a wayang performance where the almighty Jagatk\u0101ra\u1e47a (world mover) as the supreme puppeteer (wayang master) is only a thin screen of a human being. This mention of wayang as wayang kulit indicates that wayang performances were already known at the court of Airlangga and the wayang tradition was well established in Java, perhaps earlier.", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "An inscription from this period also mentions some occupations as awayang and aringgit.

It was Raden Patah and Sunan Kali Jaga who made a big contribution. Look for puppets in West Java, golek ono in Javanese, until you find the wong in the middle, don't just find the skin in the East in wetan wiwitan.

Wayang is genuine Javanese, pakeliran means a pair between the shadow and the original item. Like the two creeds. As for God masyrik wal maghrib, it must be translated into Javanese first, which means wetan kawitan and kulon or kula or me inside. Look for the god who is the first kawitan and who is in the human heart. (sik) Likewise, during the advent of Islam, when performances featuring \"God\" or \"Gods\" in human form were banned, puppets made of cowhide appeared, where only the shadow was seen during the performance. These puppets are now known as shadow puppets. To spread Islam, Sadat puppets were also developed to introduce Islamic values. When a Catholic missionary, Brother Timotheus L.

It is actually a different concept from \"charity\", as tzedakah is an \"obligation\", whereas \"charity\" is usually understood as an act of \"spontaneous generosity\" (goodwill) and a sign of generosity. The word \"tzedakah\" comes from the Hebrew root \u05e6\u05d3\u05e7 (tzedeq or Tzedek) meaning \"righteous\", \"pious\", or \"just\". A related Hebrew word is Tzadik, which means \"righteous\" as an adjective, but can also mean \"righteous person\" or \"pious person\" as a noun in the substantive form. In Judaism, tzedakah refers to the religious obligation to do what is \"right and just\", which is emphasized as an important part of the spiritual life. Maimonides said that although the second highest form of tzedakah is to make an anonymous donation to an unidentified recipient, the highest form is to make a gift, loan or partnership, so that the recipient can support himself without depending on others. Unlike normal acts of charity or philanthropy, which are voluntary, tzedakah is a religious obligation, which must be performed regardless of wealth status, and must even be performed by the poor. Tzedakah is considered one of the three major acts that can cancel out the lesser heavenly commandments. In Islam, the term tzedakah is the same as the Islamic term \"Sadaqah\" or \"Saddka\" (Arabic: \u0635\u062f\u0642\u0629) which means \"voluntary charity\". The Hebrew Bible teaches the obligation to help those in need, but does not use just one term for this obligation.", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "The term tzedekah appears 157 times in the Masoretic Text, usually in relation to \"righteousness\", and generally in the singular, but sometimes tzedekot is written in the plural, in relation to acts of charity.

In classical rabbinic literature, it is argued that the biblical regulations regarding leftovers only applied to cornfields, orchards, and vineyards, and not to vegetable gardens. The classical rabbinic authors were much stricter in determining who was entitled to receive the leftovers. It states that farmers are not permitted to profit from what is scattered, and are not permitted to discriminate against the poor, or try to frighten them with dogs or lions (Hullin 131a, Pe'ah 05:06). The farmers were not even allowed to help one of the poor to collect the scraps. However, there are also those who argue that the law only applied in Canaan, even though many classical rabbinic writers who dwelt in Babylon practiced the law there (Hullin 134b). Still others view the rule as applying only to the Jewish poor, but the non-Jewish poor were allowed to benefit for the sake of civil peace. Maimonides lists the Eight Levels of Giving, which is written in the Mishneh Torah: In practice, most Jews perform tzedakah by donating a portion of their income to charitable organizations, or to poor people they encounter. There is a perception among modern Jews that if donations in this form are not possible, the obligation of tzedakah should still be performed by giving something away.

One end is the cervix, opening into the vagina, and the other wider end, considered the body of the uterus, is joined on both sides by the Fallopian tubes. The uterus comes in different shapes and sizes in different organisms. In humans it is pear-shaped and about the size of a chicken egg. Some organisms such as cats and pigs, as well as other types of carnivores have a bipartite uterus. The uterus is placed in the pelvis and is dorsal (and usually somewhat cranial) to the bladder and ventral to the rectum. The uterus is held in place by several ligaments. Outside of pregnancy, its midline size is a few centimeters. The uterus is mostly made up of muscle. The innermost permanent layer of that tissue is called the endometrium. In most mammals, including humans, the endometrium creates a lining at certain times which, if no pregnancy occurs, is shed or reabsorbed. The shedding of the endometrial lining in humans is caused by menstruation (known as a woman's \"period\") during a woman's fertile years. In other mammals there may be cycles as long as six months or as frequent as a few days. The main function of the uterus is to receive the fertilized ovum which is embedded into the endometrium, and derives nourishment from blood vessels developed specifically for this purpose. The fertilized ovum becomes an embryo, develops into a fetus and gestates until birth. Due to anatomical obstacles such as the pelvis, the uterus is pushed partially into the abdomen until its expansion during pregnancy. Even in pregnancy, the human uterus weighs only about a kilogram (2.2 pounds) The human uterus is found only in the female reproductive organs. The uterus is shaped like a peer or avocado with a size of about 7-7.5 cm long and about 5.25 cm long with a thickness of about 2.5 cm and a thickness of the uterine wall of 1.25 cm.", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "Intention (Arabic: \u0646\u064a\u0629 Niyyat) is the desire in the heart to perform an action directed only to Allah. Linguistically, Arabs use the word intention in the sense of 'intentionally'. Sometimes intention is also used in the sense of something intended or deliberate. In terms of terms, there is no specific definition for intention. Therefore, whoever sets a specific definition that differs from the linguistic meaning of intention does not have a good reason to do so. That is why many scholars have given the meaning of intention in language, such as Nawawi, who said that intention is intending to do something and being determined to do it.\" Another opinion says: \"Intention is the intention in one's heart to do something that one wants to do.\" al-Khathabi says: \"Intention is intending to do something with the heart and making a choice to do it. Dr. Umar al-Ashqar said, \"Defining it by intention and determination is the strongest opinion. This definition refers to the meaning of the word intention in Arabic.\" There are also scholars who define intention by ikhlash. This is acceptable because sometimes the meaning of intention is intending to do an act of worship, and sometimes it means being sincere in doing an act of worship. According to Ibn Rajab in \"Commentary on the 40th hadith of Imam Nawawi: Hadith #1\", actions are judged according to intention, \"Umar bin Khattab narrated that the prophet said, 'All deeds depend on their intentions, and each person only gets what he intends.'\" Correspondingly, one's intention is very important among acts of worship. There is debate as to whether or not an intention should be spoken.", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "Most scholars agree that the intention should only be made in the heart or in the mind, and does not need to be spoken, including the scholars of the Shafi'iyyah school. Moreover, there is no evidence that the Prophet Muhammad or his Companions ever uttered the intention when going to prayer or other acts of worship. * The first view is that some Muslims recite the intention and some do not, and the majority of scholars are of the view that it should not be recited. This first opinion is supported by the hadeeth of 'A'ishah, narrated by Imam Shafi'i and recorded by Imam Muslim, that the Prophet Muhammad started the prayer with takbir. Abdullah ibn Umar also said the same thing. Qadhi Abu Rabi' As-Shaafa'i, a great scholar of the Shafi'i school, said: \"Loudening the intention and recitation behind the imam is not part of the Sunnah. Rather it is something that is hated, and if it disturbs the other worshippers then it is haraam.\" The intention is an action of the heart, so its place is in the heart; in fact, everything that a person intends to do, his intention is automatically embedded in his heart. According to this first opinion, every act of worship should follow the guidance of the Prophet Muhammad (\u064b\u0627\u0650\u062a\u0650\u0651\u0628\u064e\u0627\u0639\u064f al-ittiba'). So any worship that is held in a new way that has never been taught or done (bid'ah) by the Prophet Muhammad then the worship is rejected, even though the perpetrator was a Muslim whose intention was sincere for Allah in worship (mukhlis). * The second opinion is that it is permissible to recite the intention in performing an obligatory or supererogatory prayer. This opinion is from other scholars of the Shafi'i school of thought. They state the necessity of including pronunciation in the prayer intention. These scholars are Shaykh Salim ibn Samir Al-Hadlrami and Shaykh Abu Abdil Mu'thi Muhammad Nawawi Al-Jawi, who said \"...and the place of intention is the heart and the recitation of the intention is Sunnah...\" The reason for this is only the explanation that \"the verbal utterance of the intention helps the heart to become firm\".", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "Blibli.com which is a subsidiary of Djarum in the digital field which was founded in 2010.

This group includes familiar animals such as lobsters, crabs, shrimps, crayfish, and barnacles. The majority are aquatic animals, either freshwater or marine, although some groups have adapted to land life, such as land crabs. Most members can move freely, although some taxa are parasitic and live by hitching a ride on their host. The crustacean body consists of two parts, the fused thoracic head (cephalothorax) and the abdominal or hind body (abdomen). The cephalothorax is protected by a hard skin called the carapace and five pairs of legs consisting of one pair of claws and four pairs of walking legs. In addition, in the cephalothorax there is also a pair of antennae, upper jaw, and lower jaw. While on the abdomen there are 5 pairs of swimming legs and at the end there is a tail. In female shrimp, the legs on the abdomen also function to store their eggs. The crustacean digestive system starts from the mouth, esophagus, stomach, intestines, and anus. The rest of the metabolism will be excreted through the fire cells. The crustacean nervous system is referred to as the staircase nervous system, where the head ganglion (brain) is connected to the antennae (sense of touch), eyes (sense of sight), and statocysts (sense of balance). Crustaceans breathe with gills attached to their limbs and their circulatory system is an open circulatory system. O2 enters from the water into the gill vessels, while CO2 diffuses in the opposite direction. O2 will be circulated throughout the growing without going through blood vessels.

Crustaceans are divided into two sub-classes, Entomostraca (lower crustaceans) and Malacostrata (larger crustaceans). Entomostraca are generally small and are zooplankton found in marine or freshwater waters. This group of animals is usually used as fish food, for example, the orders Copepoda, Cladocera, Ostracoda, and Amphipoda. Meanwhile, Malacostrata generally live in the sea and beaches. Included in the Malacostrata are the orders Decapoda and Isopoda. Examples of species are tiger shrimp (Panaeus), king prawn (Macrobanchium rosenbergi), crab (Neptune pelagicus), and crab (Portunus sexdentalus).

The Sadducees were also responsible for temple worship as priests, with almost all priests being classified as such. The office of Jewish High Priest was generally occupied by Sadducees, but not all Sadducees were priests. It is possible that the Sadducees also consisted of wealthy laymen and landlords. The Sadducees left no written evidence about themselves, so the information about them comes from the opposing groups, so most views of them are negative. In the Gospel accounts of the New Testament, the Sadducees are often portrayed as opponents of Jesus. Another written source about the Sadducees comes from Flavius Josephus. The name \"Sadducee\" is thought to be derived from Zadok which was the name of the high priest who lived during the time of King David. Their activities in the political sphere actually began during the reign of the Persian Empire, where they came into contact with foreign rulers and tended to accept Hellenization. The Sadducees came to power during the time of John Hirkanus, Aristobulus, and Alexander Janeus. During the Maccabean revolt and reign, the priestly dominance diminished and the Pharisees gained more power (76-67 BC). Afterwards, during the Roman rule, the Sadducees regained their political importance. The Sadducees acted as aristocrats in the Jewish society colonized by the Romans, hence their relationship with the Roman government. The position of High Priest, which was the highest position in the Temple, mediated between the Jewish people and the Roman governor. Thus, the political stance of the Sadducees was ambiguous, for as true Jews they should not have accepted the existence of foreign rulers in the Jewish land, but on the other hand, they were realistic about the fact that the Romans were stronger and the Jews were powerless.", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "They were also ambivalent about the expansion of Greek culture or Hellenism, which had begun to take place in Jewish lands since the Seleucid dynasty. They were sympathetic and inclined towards Hellenism, and wanted to absorb as much as possible, but at the same time they wanted to maintain their Jewish identity. That meant they had to define what was essential to Judaism in such a way that there were other areas where they could absorb Hellenism. Thus, in daily life, the Sadducees were inclined to adapt to Greek life, while in the religious sphere they upheld Judaism according to the Torah of Moses. This was possible because they were not like the Pharisees who held various interpretations and additional laws from the Law of Moses. According to Josephus, the Sadducees rejected the concepts of predestination, immortality of the soul, and eternal reward after death, and they accepted free will. He also noted that the Pharisees gave certain rules to the people that were not recorded by Moses, and the Sadducees rejected them. Thus, the Sadducees only recognized the authority of the five books of the Law of Moses and rejected the oral traditions that were interpretations of the Law of Moses, and were commonly accepted by the masses. In addition, the Sadducees rejected the concept of the resurrection of the dead, and the existence of angels and spirits. In addition, they were suspicious of the popular Jewish belief of a Messiah coming from God to free the Jewish land from colonization. Because of their strong emphasis on the Law of Moses, the Sadducees placed great importance on the worship of God through the cult of the Temple in Jerusalem. The Sadducees tended to believe that as long as the altars were still puffing smoke in the Temple, and if the cults were still being faithfully practiced, then the religious demands would be fulfilled, and God would be with them.", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "Source: Galangal, laos or kelawas (Karo language) (Alpinia galanga) is a type of tuberous plant that can live in highland and lowland areas.

However, this work was not composed at the behest of Hayam Wuruk himself with the aim of political self-image or legitimization of power. Rather, it was purely the will of the poet Mpu Prapanca who wanted to pay tribute to the crown, and hoped that the King would remember the poet who had once served in the Majapahit palace.

A number of Sunni scholars have said that the word rafidhah is not addressed to the Shi'a in general but only to those who cultivate Ali bin Abi Talib and deny Abu Bakr and Umar as caliphs.

Ja'far as-Sadiq believed rafidhah to be the first God-given honorific to appear in the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament: he mentioned that there were 70 people among Pharaoh's followers who rejected the religion of the King of Egypt in favor of joining the Prophet Moses, and God called these 70 people rafidhah.", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "They were called rafidhah because they rejected Pharaoh, were devout in worship, and had a very close love for Moses, Aaron, and their descendants. Sadiq further states that God revealed to Prophet Moses, \"Establish this name for them in the Torah, for I have named them by it and given it to them.\" He extended the use of the word to refer to the shias (followers) of Muhammad's family. The word rafidhah does not exist in the Qur'an. Therefore, there is speculation that he referred to the Bible to establish its validity. However, the story of Pharaoh's resistors from among the sorcerers who joined Moses does not appear in any book of the Bible. Some argue that the story of Pharaoh's magicians choosing to believe was in the Original Manuscripts, but their enemies erased it. The word turned into a mockery of the Shia, which emerged early in Islamic history, dating back to Zayd bin Ali's opposition to the Umayyad Caliphate, according to one source. The word refers to the inhabitants of Kufa who rejected Zayd's policy regarding the prohibition of denouncing or cursing the first two Rashidine caliphs, as he claimed to have never heard of denouncing them. Zayd b. 'Ali considered 'Ali the best leader after Muhammad, but he still respected Abu Bakr and 'Umar. As a result, many residents of Kufa disavowed Zayd b. 'Ali's policies, giving rise to the term rafidhah. This interpretation continued to shift over time. In Zaydid sources the term used by Zayd b. 'Ali against a number of the people of Kufa was not because they rejected the caliphate of Abu Bakr and 'Umar but because they rejected Zayd's claim to the Imamate because they considered Ja'far Sadiq to be the Imam instead: Allah is Great! By Allah, you are the Rafidhah of whom the Messenger of Allah once said: 'There will be a people who will abandon jihad in favor of Ahl al-Bayt and they will say that no one commands good or forbids evil!", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "Publius (or Gaius) Cornelius Tacitus (~56 - 117 AD) was a Senator and chronicler of the Roman Empire.

This work covers the history of the Roman Empire from the death of Emperor Augustus in 14 AD to the death of Emperor Domitian in 96. He was a pen pal of Plinius the Younger. Tacitus was appointed quaestor during the reign of Emperor Titus. Since the youngest age limit for this office was 25, this is how one determines the year of his birth. He served in various provinces from ~89 to 93 AD. His wife was the daughter of General Julius Agricola. Although he did not suffer any ill effects from the arbitrary actions of Emperor Domitian, Tacitus developed a hatred of tyrannical rule that is evident in his writings, such as Agricola.While serving as a senator, he became Consul Suffek in 97 during the reign of Nerva, the first of his family to hold this office. In his later years, he concentrated on writing the Agricola and Germania, and remained a writer until the end of his life. He worked again as an official in the time of Emperor Trajan. In 100, together with his friend Plinius the Younger, he became the prosecutor for Marius Priscus, proconsul of Africa, on charges of corruption. Priscus was found guilty and sentenced to banishment. Plinius wrote a few days later that Tacitus spoke with all the eloquence that characterized his speeches.In his absence from politics and law, he completed his 2 major works: Histories and Annals.

Unlike other kenturans who were drunken, wild, and uncultured, Kheiron was intelligent, civilized, and kind. He was known for his knowledge and ability in medicine. Kheiron was the son of Kronos when Kronos was in the form of a horse Kheiron's lineage was different from the other kenturans who were born from the sun and rain clouds. Kheiron was clever because he was taught by Apollo and Artemis when he was young. Kheiron is famous throughout Greek mythology because he educated the young Achilles. His skills were similar to those of his foster father, Apollo, who taught him as a youth the arts of medicine, herbs, music, archery, hunting, gymnastics and divination, and transformed him from his cruel nature. Kheiron is renowned for his knowledge and skill in medicine, and is considered the inventor of botany and pharmacy, the science of plants and medicines. Like satires, centaurs are notorious for being wild, lustful, drinkers and drunks, violent when drunk, and generally uncultured brutes. In contrast, Kheiron is an intelligent, civilized and kind centaur. This is influenced by his origins so that he never came into direct contact with other centaurs. He is the son of Titan Kronos and Oceanid Philyra. He is possibly related to Dolops and Aphrus, the ancestors and eponymous Aphroi, the natives of Africa. Kheiron lived on Mount Pelion; there he married the nymph Khariklo who bore him three daughters, Hippe (also known as Melanippe meaning \"black horse\" or Euippe, \"good horse\"), Ende\u00efs, and Ocyrhoe, and one son Carystus. A different source also states that his wife was called Nais. There are also those who claim Aristaeus was her son.", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "Like other centaurs, Kheiron was later banished by Lapithae from his home. The Magnesians worshipped him and often made sacrifices to him. The Cheironidae family, renowned for their knowledge of medicine, are considered his descendants. Although a centaur, Kheiron's physical appearance was somewhat different from other centaurs, indicating his status and wisdom. In traditional Greek depictions of Kheiron, his forelegs are human legs, not horse, in contrast to traditional depictions of centaurs, which have the entire lower body of a horse. This clearly distinguishes Kheiron from other centaurs, making him easily recognizable. This difference may also highlight Kheiron's unique lineage, as the son of Kronos. Kheiron is often depicted carrying a twig with a dead rabbit he caught hanging from it. Kheiron is also often depicted wearing clothes, suggesting that he is more civilized and unlike normal centaurs (the only occasional exceptions being the centaurs Nessus and Pholus). The fresco Education of Achilles from the basilica at Herculaneum (top right), is one of the most common Roman depictions of Kheiron, as he teaches Achilles the lyre. In this version, we see Kheiron with a fully equine lower body, in contrast to the ancient Greek depiction. In addition to this reconfiguration, Kheiron's appearance is further changed by his ears. Whereas once human, Kheiron's ears are now the same as those of a satyr; folded at the top. This rendering creates a more bestial version of Kheiron, much more similar to the standard centaur. Perhaps due to the advent of written sources, Roman artists were inspired by written descriptions of Kheiron; simply using the word centaur, rather than having a traditional visual representation available. This, then, may not be a deliberate reworking of the Kheiron myth by the Romans, but simply a nuance of the character that was lost in his migration from Greece to Rome.", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "(the first use of the word Pharaoh to refer to a king dates back to around 1210 BC during the reign of Merneptah in the 19th Dynasty) Pharaoh (Arabic: \u0641\u0631\u0639\u0648\u0646, /fir'aun/ English: Pharaoh, /\u02c8f\u025b\u0259ro\u028a/; Egyptian: pr \ua725\ua723 /p\u0259r\u0259\u02be\u014d/; Hebrew: \u05e4\u05b7\u05bc\u05e8\u05b0\u05e2\u05b9\u05d4, /p\u0103r\u02bf\u014d/) was a common title now used for the kings of ancient Egypt from the First Dynasty (c. 3150 BC) until the annexation of Egypt by the Roman Empire in 30 BC.

The word has only been used to metonymically refer to Egyptian kings since the New Kingdom era (starting from the 18th Dynasty, 1539-1292 BC). And by the 22nd Dynasty (circa 945-730 BC) it was adopted as an honorific. The word \"fir'aun\" or \"pharaoh\" was never a formal title of the Egyptian kings of the time. The use of the word \"pharaoh\" as a generic name for all Egyptian kings comes from its use in the Hebrew Bible, where in the Qur'\u0101n it is \"fir'aun\". In official documents, the full title of an Egyptian king consists of five names, each preceded by one of the following titles: Horus, Two Women, Golden Horus, King of Upper and Lower Egypt, and Son of Re. The last name is given at birth, while the others at coronation. In the Egyptian community, religion was central to daily life. One of the roles of the Pharaoh was as a link between Gods and humans. Pharaoh then represented the Gods in the role of civil and religious administrator. Pharaoh owned all the land in Egypt, enacted laws, collected taxes, and defended Egypt from invaders as commander of the army. Religiously, the Pharaoh was responsible for maintaining Maat (m\ua723\ua725t), or cosmic order, balance and justice, and part of this included going to war if necessary to defend the country or attacking other nations when it was believed that doing so would contribute to Maat, such as acquiring resources.", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "Ka, also (alternatively) Sekhen, was a pre-medieval Pharaoh of Upper Egypt dating from Naqada III.

There is a vessel inscription showing a serekh with a distinctive Ka symbol, both correctly written upright, but there is also an inscription presenting an upright serekh with an inverted Ka symbol. The form of both inscriptions suggests a reading as Sekhen (meaning 'embracing s.o.') rather than Ka. It is also thought to be Narmer's birth name. As the reading of the name is highly uncertain, Egyptologists and scribes such as Ludwig David Morenz prefer a neutral reading as 'Arms of the King'. Ka reigned over Tinis in the first half of the 32nd century BC and was buried at Umm el-Qa'ab. He was most likely the direct successor of Iry-Hor and was succeeded by either Narmer or Scorpion II. He is the earliest known Egyptian king with serekh inscribed on a number of artifacts. As such, this could be an invasion of his reign. Ka was one of the pre-synastic kings with Narmer and Scorpion II. Outside Abydos, he is attested at the pre-synastic necropolis of Adaima in Upper Egypt and north of Tarkhan, Helwan, Tell Ibrahim Awad, Wadi Tumilat and as far north as Tel Lod in the southern Levant. The number of artifacts containing Ka serekhs found outside Abydos is much greater than its predecessor. This may be a sign of the increasing influence and perhaps conquest of large parts of Egypt by the Tinis kings. Two underground chambers, B7 and B9, in the necropolis of Umm el-Qa'ab, Abydos are believed to be part of King Ka's tomb. Each chamber is 1.90 m deep, B.7 is 6.0 \u00d7 3.2 m while B.9 is slightly smaller at 5.9 x 3.1 m; both chambers are 1.80 m in diameter.

In the fields of sociology, anthropology, and other social science fields, the term positivism is closely related to the term naturalism and can be traced to the thinking of Auguste Comte in the 19th century. Comte argued that positivism is a way of understanding the world based on science. According to Comte, scientific theories can be organized from simple and universal levels to more complex and limited stages. This arrangement of levels can continue to be developed so that each new science will depend on the previous stage. Positivists believe that there is little (if any) difference between the social sciences and the natural sciences, as society and social life operate according to rules, as does nature. Etymologically, positivism comes from the word positive, which in the language of philosophy means an event that actually happened, which can be experienced as a reality.

The local government refers to it as the Kurdistan Region. The full name of the government is the Kurdistan Regional Government. Kurds also refer to the region as Ba\u015f\u00fbr\u00ea Kurdistan\u00ea or Ba\u015f\u00fbr\u00ee Kurdistan (Southern Kurdistan), referring to its geographical position within the overall Greater Kurdistan region. During Baath Party rule in the 1970s and 1980s, the region was called the Autonomous Region of Kurdistan. Before Iraq became an independent state in 1923, Iraqi Kurds had begun their struggle for independence from the British Mandate of Mesopotamia with Mahmud Barzanji's rebellion, which was later crushed by the British after a bombing campaign against Kurdish civilians by the British Air Force. Nonetheless, the Kurdish struggle persisted and the Barzani tribe experienced in the early 1920s gained momentum for the Kurdish nationalist cause and would become pivotal in the Kurdish-Iraqi wars throughout the 20th century. In 1943, the head of the local authority Mustafa Barzani began a raid on Iraqi police stations began in Kurdistan, which led the Baghdad government to deploy 30,000 troops to the region. The Iraqi Kurdish leader fled to Iran in 1945. There, Mustafa Barzani founded the Kurdistan Democratic Party, and Iran and the Soviet Union began assisting Kurdish rebels with weapons. Israel began aiding Kurdish rebels in the early 1960s. From 1961 to 1970, the Kurds fought the Iraqi government in the First Iraqi-Kurdish War, which resulted in the Iraqi-Kurdish Autonomy Agreement. But along with the promise of Kurdish autonomy, the Iraqi government began ethnic cleansing in Kurdish-populated areas, to reduce the size of the autonomous entity to be determined by a census.", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "Bitung City is one of the cities in North Sulawesi province, Indonesia. The city, which is of the Minahasa sub-ethnic Tonsea ethnic group, has rapid development due to the presence of a seaport that encourages accelerated development. Bitung City is located in the northeast of Minahasa Land. The area of Bitung City consists of the mainland area at the foot of Mount Dua Saudara and an island called Lembeh. Many residents of Bitung City come from the Sangir tribe, so the culture in Bitung is inseparable from the culture in the Nusa Utara region. Bitung City is an industrial city, especially the fishing industry. The Central Bureau of Statistics of Bitung city in 2021 recorded the population of Bitung city in 2020 as 225,134 people, with a density of 718 people/km2. The regional emblem of Bitung City is regulated in Bitung City Regional Regulation Number 1 of 1991. The basic form of the Bitung City regional emblem is a pentagon with a navy blue base color and a red border. Inside the pentagon there is an image of a green bitung tree leaf as many as 17 strands connected by 8 small circles with black borders. Inside the triangle there is also a sprig of unblossomed coconut mayangs totaling 45 in golden yellow. In the center of the triangle is a vignette depicting a pair of silver fish, a black Manguni bird and the green Dua Saudara mountain. The center of the symbol also depicts a silver anchor, an industrial building, a government office, and a trading building.

Dotu Hermanus Sompotan was not alone but at that time he came together with Dotu Rotti, Dotu Wullur, Dotu Ganda, Dotu Katuuk, Dotu Lengkong. The meaning of the word Dotu is an elder or can also be referred to as a leadership title at that time, just like the use of the word Datuk for people in Sumatra. They were all known as 6 Dotu Tumani Bitung, they opened and worked on the area so that it became an area suitable for habitation, they all came from the Minahasa tribe, Tonsea ethnicity. This new coastal area attracted many people to come and settle down, so over time the population of Bitung began to grow. Before becoming a town, Bitung was just a village led by Arklaus Sompotan as the first Hukum Tua (Lurah) of Bitung village and led for approximately 25 years, at which time Bitung Village was included in Kauditan Sub-district. From around the 1940s, fisheries entrepreneurs working in the Sulawesi Sea were interested in Bitung compared to Kema (in present-day North Minahasa Regency) which used to be a trading port, because in their view Bitung was more strategic and could be used as a replacement port for Kema. Along with the development, Bitung as a strategic area as well as the number of population that is increasing rapidly now, then based on Government Regulation No. 4 of 1975 dated April 10, 1975 Bitung was inaugurated as the first Administrative City in Indonesia.

In Latin and other languages in general (including Indonesian), this letter usually represents a bifid consonant, specifically the phoneme b], a voiced bifid eruptive consonant. 'B' comes from a pictogram of a house plan in the Egyptian hieroglyphic or Proto-Sinai script. Around 1050 BC, the letter was developed in the Phoenician alphabet into a linear form and named beth. The lowercase 'b' originated in Roman upright letters, when scribes began to ignore the upper curves in their capitals. 'B' is often confused with a similar German letter, '\u00df', which replaces 'ss'. In most languages that use the Latin alphabet, the letter B signifies a voiced bicuspid lipped consonant (/b/). In Estonian, Icelandic, and also Chinese transcriptions, B is voiceless, but still differentiated from the letter P, which is lengthened to /pp/ in Estonian, and also exhaled to /p\u02b0/ in Chinese and Icelandic. In Fijian, B is radicalized to /mb/, while in Zulu and Xhosa it becomes the back-blow consonant /\u0253/, versus the two-letter Bh which represents /b/. Finnish only uses the letter b for loanwords. In IPA and X-SAMPA alphabets, the letter /b/ signifies a voiced bicuspid eruptive consonant. There are variant forms of the letter b that signify related bilabial consonants, such as voiced bilingual back-flush consonants and bilingual trill consonants. In X-SAMPA, the uppercase letter B indicates a voiced bilingual hiss consonant. The letter B is also used as a musical note.

Compounds that include steroid derivatives, such as cholesterol, ergosterol, progesterone, and estrogen. In general, steroids function as hormones. Steroids have a basic structure consisting of 17 carbon atoms which form three cyclohexane rings and one cyclopentane ring. The difference between one type of steroid and another lies in the functional groups bound by these four rings and the oxidation stage of each ring. Sterol fats are a special form of steroids with the formula derived from cholestane with a hydroxyl group at the C-3 atom, found in many plants, animals and functions. All steroids are made in cells with raw materials in the form of sterol fats, either in the form of lanosterol in animals or functions, or in the form of cycloartenol in plants. Both types of sterol fat above are made from cyclization of squalene from triterpene. Cholesterol is another common type of sterol fat. Some steroids are anabolic, including testosterone, methandienone, nandrolone decanoate, 4-androstene-3 17-dione. Anabolic steroids can cause a number of harmful side effects, such as lowering the ratio of high-density lipoproteins, which are beneficial for the heart, lowering the ratio of low-density lipoproteins, stimulation of prostate tumors, coagulation abnormalities and liver disorders, baldness, thickening of hair, acne and breast development in men. Physiologically, anabolic steroids can make a person aggressive. Steroids are a form of modified triterpene, so the constituent units are isoprene, namely IPP and DMAPP.

It encompasses almost all of North Asia. Siberia extends east from the Ural Mountains to the Pacific Ocean and south from the Arctic Ocean to the hills of north-central Kazakhstan and the borders of Mongolia and China. Siberia is within Russia except in the far southwest, and it covers 75% of Russia's territory. The Siberian region has a great paleontological history, as in its subsoil many fossils of prehistoric animals from the Pleistocene Period have been found, preserved in ice or permafrost. Specimens of Goldfuss cave lion cubs, Yuka mammoths and other woolly mammoths from Oymyakon, woolly rhinoceroses from Kolyma, and bison and horses from Yukaghir. The Siberian Basin was formed by one of the largest known volcanic events in the last 251 million years of Earth's geological history. Their activity continued for a million years and some scientists consider it a possible cause of the \"Great Dying\" around 250 million years ago - estimated to have killed 90% of the species present at the time. At least three human species lived in Southern Siberia around 40,000 years ago, including H. sapiens, H. neanderthalensis and Denisovan. By the mid-17th century Russia had established a sphere of control that extended into the Pacific Ocean. About 230,000 Russians had settled in Siberia by 1709. Siberia became one of the destinations to which refugees/exiles were sent. Exile was a major Russian punitive practice with more than 800,000 people exiled during the nineteenth century.

In the early decades of the Soviet Union (especially in the 1930s and 1940s), the government used the state institution of the Gulag to administer the labor camp system, replacing the earlier katorga system. According to semi-official Soviet estimates, which were not made public until after the fall of the Soviet government in 1991, from 1929 to 1953 more than 14 million people passed through these camps and prisons, many of them in Siberia. Another seven to eight million people were deported to remote areas of the Soviet Union. Half a million (516,841) prisoners died in the 1941-1943 camps during World War II. In other periods, deaths were relatively lower. The size, scope and scale of Gulag labor camps remain the subject of much research and debate. Many Gulag camps operated in very remote areas in northeastern Siberia. The most notorious clusters were Sevvostlag (Northeast Camp) along the Kolyma and Norillag near Norilsk, where 69,000 prisoners lived in 1952.

This institutional leaf is formed during the seed stage so that the seeds of most of its members are easily split in half. Classically, flowering plants are divided into two major groups, namely two-seeded plants and single-seeded plants (monocots). A number of influential plant classification systems, such as the Takhtajan system and the Cronquist system recognized this group as a taxon and named it the class Magnoliopsida. This name was formed by replacing the suffix -aceae in the name Magnoliaceae with the suffix -opsida (Article 16 in ICBN). The class Magnoliopsida is used as a taxon name for all non-monocotyl flowering plants. Magnoliopsida is the name used to replace the name used by the older classification system, the class Dicotyledoneae (the class of \"institutional leafy plants\" or \"dicotyledonous plants\"). The APG II classification system, which was slowly coming into widespread use, did not recognize this group anymore because it was paraphyletic: it was incomplete if single-seeded plants were not included. Furthermore, this system found that this group contained at least seven genetically distinct clades: Of these seven clades, there is one large, monophyletic group that has consistently characterized the Magnoliopsida and is called the Eudicotyls (\"true dicotyledons\"). Ironically, Magnoliaceae do not belong to the true dicotyledons.

Egyptologists generally consider her to be the most accomplished female pharaoh in Egypt, reigning longer than any other female ruler in an original Egyptian dynasty. Hatshepsut is believed to have reigned as one of the rulers from around 1479 to 1458 BC (Years 7 to 21 of Thutmose III). She is considered the earliest known ruling queen in history as well as the second woman known to have ascended the throne as \"King of Upper and Lower Egypt\" after Queen Sobekneferu of the 12th Dynasty. On June 27, 2007, a mummy in tomb KV60 in the Valley of the Kings was identified as Hatshepsut. According to some ancient chroniclers, [more details] Hatshepsut's reign was about 22 years. Flavius Josephus records the length of her reign as 21 years and 9 months, while Sextus Julius Africanus gives it as 22 years, both citing Manetho. At this point in history, the record of Hatshepsut's reign ends, as the overseas invasion by Thutmosis III occurred in the 22nd year of his reign, which was also the 22nd year of Hatshepsut's reign as Pharaoh. The timing of her accession to the throne is more difficult. The reign of his father, Thutmose I, began in 1506 BC or 1526 BC according to the chronology of young or old Egypt. The length of the reigns of Tuthmosis I and Tuthmosis II cannot be ascertained. If it was short, Hatshepsut is thought to have ascended the throne 14 years after the coronation of her father, Tuthmosis I, to the throne. If it was long, then her accession occurred 25 years after Tuthmosis I's coronation. Therefore, Hatshepsut may have started reigning as early as 1512 BC, or as late as 1479 BC.", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "Evidence of the reign of Pharaoh Hatshepsut is found in the tomb of Ramose and Hatnofer, Senenmut's parents, where there is a collection of funerary items inserted into a pottery pot or amphora from the tomb chamber, which is date-stamped Year 7. Another pot from the same tomb, discovered in 1935-1936 by the Metropolitan Museum of Art expedition on the dean's hillside of Thebes, was stamped 'Wife of God, Hatshepsut' while 2 other pots were stamped 'Good goddess, Maatkare. ' The date of the amphorae, \"sealed into the burial chamber by fragments from Senenmut's own tomb,\" is no longer disputed, meaning Hatshepsut was recognized as king of Egypt in the 7th year of her reign. As the feminist movement matured, important female figures from antiquity were sought out and their successes were increasingly publicized. Hatshepsut went from being Egypt's most obscure leader at the beginning of the 20th century to the country's most famous figure by the end of the century. Biographies such as Hatshepsut by Evelyn Wells romanticize her as a beautiful, pacifist woman - \"the first great woman in History\". This is quite the opposite of the 19th century view of Hatshepsut which paints her as a cruel stepmother, who usurped the throne from Thutmose III. The novel Mara, Daughter of the Nile by Eloise Jarvis McGraw, maintains the view of the cruel stepmother by placing Hatshepsut as the protagonist of the story. The plot develops around the efforts of Mara, a slave girl, and a number of nobles to overthrow Hatshepsut and install her \"rightful\" heir, Thutmose III, as Pharaoh. They blamed Hatshepsut's various development projects for the bankruptcy of the Egyptian state. She is also described as having held Thutmose III prisoner within the palace walls.", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "Automatic pilot (from English: autopilot) is a mechanical, electrical, or hydraulic system that guides a vehicle without human intervention. Generally, autopilots are associated with aircraft, but autopilots are also used on ships under the same term. In the early days of air transportation, aircraft required constant attention from a pilot in order to fly safely. This required a great deal of attention from the crew and resulted in fatigue. Automatic pilot systems were invented to perform some of the tasks of the pilot. The first automatic pilot system was invented by Sperry Corporation in 1912. Lawrence Sperry (son of the famous inventor Elmer Sperry) demonstrated it two years later in 1914 and proved the credibility of his invention by flying an airplane without him steering it. The automatic pilot connects the altitude indicator using a gyroscope and magnetic compass to the rudder, elevator and ailerons. The autopilot system can fly the aircraft straight and level according to the compass direction without the pilot's intervention, thus covering 80% of the pilot's overall workload in general aviation. The straight-and-level autopilot system is still common today, is cheaper and is the most trusted type of autopilot. It also has the smallest error rate due to its uncomplicated controls. In the early 1920s, the Standard Oil tanker J.A Moffet became the first ship to use an automatic pilot. In 1931, an American pilot, Wiley Post flew a Lockheed Vega airplane-\"Winnie Mae\"-in an attempt to circumnavigate the globe in a record 8 days 15 hours and 5 minutes. Post had a navigator he named Harold Gatty to help him stay at home and fight fatigue on the historic flight. But when Post became the first person to fly solo around the world in 1933, he did it all by himself with no help from anyone else.", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "And it turns out that the secret of his success, or at least one of the secrets of his success, is very simple: the autopilot system that pilots the plane while he rests. Today, autopilots are highly sophisticated systems capable of performing the same tasks as a highly trained pilot. In fact for some flight procedures and routines, autopilots are even better than a pair of human hands. Autopilots not only make flights smoother but also safer and more efficient. A control system is a device (collection of devices) for controlling, commanding, and regulating the state of a system. A simple example of this control system can be practiced manually to control the steering wheel of a car when we drive / drive our car, for example, using the principle of loloh balik. In an automated system, this kind of device is often used for guided bullets so that the bullet will reach the desired target. There are many other examples in industry/instrumentation and in our daily lives where this system is used. Air conditioning (AC) is an example that many of us encounter that uses the principle of control systems, because the room temperature can be controlled so that the room is at the temperature we want. The first person to demonstrate an automatic pilot system was Lawrence Sperry, in 1914. Lawrence Sperry created this automatic pilot system in 1912 with the help of the Sperry Corporation. The son of the famous inventor Elmer Sperry, has proven the credibility of his invention by flying an airplane without being driven by him. Sperry's invention was then applied to the Standard Oil tanker J.A Moffet, which became the first ship to use an automatic pilot in the early 1920s.

It also helps stabilize body temperature and pH (part of homeostasis). There are two types of circulatory systems: the open circulatory system, and the closed circulatory system. The circulatory system, which is also part of the performance of the heart and vascular network (cardiovascular system), is formed to ensure the survival of the organism, supported by the metabolism of every cell in the body and maintaining the chemical and physiological properties of body fluids. The resulting metabolites or waste products (such as urea or uric acid) are then transported to other tissues or excretory organs (kidneys and colon). Also distributes blood such as hormones, immune cells and parts of the clotting system in the body. The heart is a vital organ of the circulatory system. The function of the heart in the circulation process is to pump blood throughout the body. The heart works together with blood vessels in the circulation process. Blood vessels have the role of circulating blood to and from the heart. Blood is also a core component in this process, blood contains oxygen and nutrients that will be distributed to every cell of the body. In addition to these organs, there are other additional organs, namely the lungs. The lungs not only play a role in the respiration process. In the circulatory system, the lungs are responsible for exchanging carbon dioxide in the blood with oxygen that is inhaled during the breathing process. The circulatory process aims to circulate blood containing nutrients to every cell of the body. The process of blood circulation has its own pathway. Based on the pathways and substances it carries, the circulatory system is divided into two types: the large circulatory system and the small circulatory system.", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "The large circulatory system is the circulatory system that transports oxygen-rich blood from the heart to the rest of the body and then back to the heart. The stages in this process begin when the blood is pumped by the heart of the left chamber (left ventricle) will enter the aorta and arteries then into capillaries throughout the body. From the capillaries throughout the body to the venules proceed to the veins and vena cava and finally enter the heart again in the right foyer of the heart (dexter atrium). The circulation is Heart (left chamber) - Aorta - Arteries - Capillaries (whole body) - Veins - Heart (right foyer). The small circulatory system is the circulatory system from the heart to the lungs back again to the heart by carrying blood containing carbon dioxide. The circulation process begins when blood is pumped in the right chambers of the heart (dexter ventricle) out through the pulmonary artery to the lungs. In the lungs the alveolus section exchanges oxygen and carbon dioxide. From the lungs the blood returns to the pulmonary veins and goes to the left ventricle of the heart. The circulation is Heart (right chamber) - Pulmonary Artery - Lungs - Pulmonary Vein - Heart (left ventricle) The heart is an organ that has four rooms, left and right atria and left and right ventricles. Blood in the left ventricle (which contains oxygen from the lungs), will be pumped throughout the body and return to the right atrium and then to the right ventricle. Blood from the right ventricle (which contains carbon dioxide from metabolism) will be carried to the lungs through the pulmonary artery so that the exchange of carbon dioxide with oxygen can occur. From the lungs, blood that already contains oxygen will be brought to the left atrium through the pulmonary veins.", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "Fluid or zalir (flowing substance) is any type of substance that can flow in the form of gas or liquid. Based on their movement, fluids can be divided into static fluids and dynamic fluids. Fluids are a sub-set of phases of matter, including liquids, gases, plasmas, and plastic solids. Fluids have the property of not resisting changes in shape and the ability to flow (or generally the ability to take the shape of their container). This property is usually due to a function of their inability to hold shear stress in static equilibrium. A consequence of this property is Pascal's law which emphasizes the importance of pressure in classifying fluid forms. A fluid is a substance or entity that deforms continuously when subjected to shear stress no matter how small that shear stress may be. Based on the direction of pressure testing the flow line, fluids are divided into 2 types, namely Newtonian fluids and non-Newtonian fluids. Fluids are also divided into liquids and gases. Liquids form free surfaces (i.e., surfaces that are not created by the shape of their container), while gases cannot form surfaces freely. The density of a fluid is equal to the amount of mass of the fluid in each unit volume. At small volumes, the density of a fluid is the quotient between the mass of the fluid and its volume. This definition is only used for fluids that have a small volume and can be observed thoroughly by sight. In fluids with very large volumes, the density of the fluid does not have a fixed value. Changes in the value of fluid density are influenced by the depth of measurement of the fluid in the liquid. The value of fluid density increases as the depth of space in the liquid increases. Fluid density whose value is not fixed occurs in dams, oceans and the atmosphere. In the atmosphere, the density value gets smaller when the fluid is measured at a position further away from the Earth's surface.", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "The changing value of fluid density is measured by adding the differentiation factor of fluid mass and volume. Pascal's Law is a law of physics made by a French scientist, Blaise Pascal. Pascal states that at an arbitrary point in the fluid, any change in pressure exerted on the fluid in a closed room will still be forwarded. Pascal's law states that each part of the fluid will receive the same pressure at each part of its surface if the fluid is in a closed room. Pressure of the same value is also experienced by the surface of the wall that limits the fluid in a closed space. Pascal's law was proposed by Blaise Pascal (1623-1662 AD) in 1653 AD.  The density of the fluid also applies Archimedes' principle. Objects will sink if the density of the object is greater than the fluid. This is a result of the buoyant force being less than the weight of the object. Conversely, an object will float if the density of the object is equal to that of the fluid. This is a result of the buoyant force being equal to the weight of the object. Based on their nature, fluids can be divided into ideal fluids and true fluids. Ideal fluids cannot undergo volume changes due to changes in pressure. In addition, ideal fluids can move without experiencing friction, so their viscosity is equal to zero. While true fluids are fluids that can experience volume changes due to changes in pressure and can experience friction when moving with a certain viscosity value. Based on its movement, fluid can be divided into static fluid and dynamic fluid. Static fluid is fluid that is in a state of motionlessness, while dynamic fluid is fluid that is in a state of motion. Fluid flow is the movement of fluid that forms a flow line with a certain speed. The marking of the flow line is on the tangent line between each point of fluid displacement with the observation of the velocity vector.", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "The Indonesian National Army (abbreviated to TNI) is the name for the armed forces of the country of Indonesia.

Besides recruiting Dutch volunteers and European mercenaries, the KNIL also recruited indigenous Indonesians.

To gain the support of the Indonesian people in the fight against the Allied Forces, Japan began to encourage and support the Indonesian nationalist movement by providing military training and weapons for Indonesian youth. On October 3, 1943, the Japanese military formed an Indonesian volunteer army called PETA (Pembela Tanah Air). The Japanese formed PETA with the intention of helping their troops oppose a possible invasion by the Allies into the southeast Asian region. Japan's military training for Indonesian youth was originally intended to rally local support for the Empire, but it later became a valuable resource for the Republic of Indonesia during the Indonesian War of Independence in 1945-1949 and was also instrumental in the formation of the People's Security Army in 1945. The Indonesian state at its inception had no army at all. The People's Security Agency, which was formed in the PPKI session on 22 August 1945 and announced by President Soekarno on 23 August 1945, was not an army as an official military organization.

It is part of the Osaka-Kobe-Kyoto metropolitan area. Kyoto has many historical sites and is the capital of Kyoto Prefecture. The palace capital (toj\u014d) named Heian-ky\u014d was established as the capital in 794. As the capital (miyako), Heian-ky\u014d became the center of Japanese government and culture. In those days, the capital was called ky\u014d no miyako which later changed to Kyoto. In ancient times, Kyoto was also called Ky\u014draku, Rakuch\u016b, or Rakuy\u014d. The history of Kyoto began when Emperor Kammu (50th Japanese emperor) moved the capital from Nagaoka-ky\u014d to Heian-ky\u014d, after Fujiwara Tanetsugu, who was in charge of building Nagaoka-ky\u014d, was assassinated.

The J\u014dkyu War, which was won by the Kamakura Shogunate, gave the Kamakura Shogunate government the opportunity to build a security office called Rokuhara Tandai in Kyoto. The office was used, among other things, to spy on the activities of the court nobility. At the end of the Kamakura period, Rokuhara Tandai was destroyed by Ashikaga Takauji. After the fall of the Kamakura Shogunate government, Emperor Go-Daigo restored power to the hands of the emperor (Kemmu Restoration). The new system of government was met with discontent among the samurai. As a result, Ashikaga Takauji rebelled against the emperor and established the Northern Court government. This event marked the beginning of the Namboku-ch\u014d period. In the Muromachi period, the Muromachi Shogunate re-established Kyoto as the capital of the government. At the same time, Kyoto recorded rapid economic growth. This period saw the birth of a tradition of city government by citizens led by successful and influential businessmen. Shogun Ashikaga Yoshimitsu established a luxurious residence called Hana-no-Gosho in the Kitakoji area of Muromachi (now in the Kamigy\u014d district). Hana-no-Gosho, the residence of Ashikaga Yoshimitsu's family, burned down during the \u014cnin War (1467-1477).

In early Attic and Boiotian vase paintings, the kentaur is depicted as the hindquarters of a horse fused with a full human body. While in later developments, the depiction of the kentaur is the human body part (from the head to the waist) fused with the horse's gumba. This half-human, half-animal composition has led many authors to consider the kentaur as liminal beings, existing between two natures, told in opposing myths, either as embodiments of the wild, as when the kentaur fought with the Lapith, or as teachers, such as Kheiron. Kentaurs are usually said to have been born of Iksion and Nefele (a cloud goddess modeled after Hera). Another version is that the kentaur race descended from Kentauros, who had sexual relations with mares in Magnesia. Kentauros himself may have been the son of Iksion and Nefele or the son of Apollo and Stilbe, daughter of the river god Peneus. In a second version, Kentauros had a brother named Lapithos, the ancestor of the Lapiths. Thus, the kentaur race and the Lapiths, who were enemies, were still brothers. Kentaurs are said to inhabit the Magnesia and Mount Pelion regions of Thessalia, the oak forests of Foloi in Elis, and the Maleia peninsula in southern Lakonia. Kentaurs appear individually or in groups in ancient Greek tales, such as in the story of the abduction of Deianeira by Nessos and the story of the marriage of Pirithous. Famous individual kentaurs are Nessos, Kheiron, Folos, Eurition. Many kentaurs appear in the story of Herakles. The Greek word kentauros is generally considered to have an obscure origin. The etymology of ken - tauros, \"impaling bull\" is an opinion that Euhemeris of Palaifatos in his work, In Extraordinary Stories (\u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u1f00\u03c0\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd): the equestrian archers of the village called Nefele killed a herd of bulls that plagued the kingdom of Iksion.", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "Another possible origin of the word kentauros is \"bull-killer\".

There, the constellation was a symbol of the god Baal who symbolized rain and fertility. He fought against the demon Mot, who symbolized summer drought, and with his horns Baal \"pierced\" Mot. In Greece, the constellation Centaurus was observed by Eudoxos of Knidos in the fourth century BC and by Aratos in the third century. Alexander Hislop, in his work, The Two Babylons: Papal Worship Revealed to be the Worship of Nimrod and His Wife, argues that the word is of Semitic origin: Kohen and \"tor\" (to go round). Through phonetic changes, the less important consonants disappeared over time, and the word evolved into Khen Tor or Ken-Tor, and was phonetically transliterated into Ionian Greek as Kentaur, but this opinion is not accepted by modern philologists (linguists). The most common theory regarding the origin of the kentaur legend is that it arose in reaction from non-horse-riding peoples, such as the Aigean Minoans, to the horse-riding nomads. This theory states that the horsemen were originally seen as half-human, half-horse creatures. Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo reports that this misinterpretation occurred when the Aztecs first saw the Spanish horsemen. The culture of horse taming itself first began in the southern steppes of Central Asia, possibly in modern-day Kazakhstan.

The Indonesian government provided capital in the form of production machines donated by Dutch textile entrepreneurs through the Dutch government. Meanwhile, GKBI provided capital in the form of land, buildings, installation costs, and working capital. The donated production machinery included 18 sets of Rieter-branded spinning machines with 9,072 spinning wheels and 180 sets of Picanol-branded binocular weaving machines. To increase production capacity and product quality, the company then established Mill II and Mill III in 1975 and 1981 respectively. The company's spinning unit produces cotton yarn, which is then further processed in the weaving unit to make grey cloth. To meet demand from the batik industry, some of the grey cloth was further processed into mori cloth. Over time, the company became undercapitalized and mismanaged, which disrupted its production process. In 2013, the Indonesian government intended to offload the company's shares to GKBI. However, this has yet to happen, as the purchase price offered by GKBI was too low. In 2018, to improve efficiency and productivity, the company purchased four sets of Japanese Tsudakoma-branded weaving machines and four sets of Italian Itema-branded weaving machines. The production capacity of the eight new weaving machines is claimed to be equivalent to that of the company's 102 old weaving machines. In April 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the company stopped producing yarn, and only produced fabric when orders came in.", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN /\u02c8a\u026ak\u00e6n/ AY-ken) is a non-profit organization in charge of directing the management and procedures of several Internet name space and numeric space databases, ensuring the stability and security of network operations.

Genderqueer people can show expressions of masculinity, femininity, both, or neither in their gender expression. The term androgyny is also often used to describe people in the genderqueer category. However, not everyone identifies as androgynous. Genderqueer people can identify with a variety of gender identities whether it is a mixture of several identities or has a less strict gender identity boundary. Examples include having more than one gender (such as bigender, trigender, or pangender), not having a gender (such as agender, nongender, genderless, or neutrois), having a genderfluid gender identity, or identifying as someone with a third or other gender including those who do not label or name their gender identity. Some genderqueer people undergo medical treatment to address their gender dysphoria with surgery and/or hormone therapy like trans men and women. The World Health Organization (WHO) states that sex/sex and gender are different things. Gender identity exists separately from one's sexual orientation or romantic orientation.

Some organizations such as the Human Rights Campaign Foundation and Gender Spectrum use the term \"gender-expansive\" to encompass gender identities and/or expressions that are broader and more flexible than the typical binary gender system. A genderfluid person (or gender fluid with spaces]) wishes to remain flexible about their gender identity rather than committing to a single gender. Genderfluid people can switch between genders or express multiple genders at the same time. Meanwhile, a pangender person is one who has a gender identity that encompasses all gender identities. An agender person, also called genderless, gender-free, or nongender, is someone who identifies as having no gender or no gender identity.

From 1992 to 2010, Tatarstan experienced negative natural population change, which coupled with emigration and internal migration as experienced by other Russian states after the fall of communism led to a population decline from 1999 to 2007. However, this decline was mild compared to other states that experienced sharp population declines, especially those located in remote areas.

For the better types, these VCRs have a timer circuit and a digital clock that can be used to automatically record TV broadcasts at desired hours. In general, these videocassette recorders (VCRs) use cassette tapes with 3 different formats: VHS format tape, Betamax format tape, and V2000 format tape.

The VHS format in the VCR world was first promoted in the United States in September 1976 by electronics company RCA. The first type of this format was capable of recording video for 2 hours. The new type of VHS tape, the T-180 type with a slower recording speed (slightly less good image quality) is capable of recording video for 9 hours continuously. Apart from the RCA company, the JVC (Japanese Victor Company) electronics company in Japan also markets its VCR products using the VHS format.

Charles Ginsburg in 1951 invented a videotape recorder, capable of capturing moving images of signals by converting electrical stimuli and storing the information on a magnetic cassette. In 1956 the VTR (video tape recorder) began to be marketed. Then the Video Cassette Recorder was first made by Charles Ginsburg and Ray Dolby in 1956, and began to be marketed in 1971.

The letter K comes from the Greek \u039a (kapa), which is derived from the letter kap in the Semitic alphabet, which is an open hand symbol. The letter kap was probably borrowed by the Semites living in Egypt from the hieroglyphic form of \"hand\" which represents the /d/ sound in the word \"hand\" in Old Egyptian, i.e. d-r-t. The Semites assigned the /k/ sound to this letter because the word \"hand\" in their language begins with that sound. In ancient Latin inscriptions, the letters C, K and Q are used to represent the sounds /k/ and /g/ (which are not distinguished in writing). In this case, Q is used to represent /k/ or /g/ before a rounded vowel, K before /a/, and C otherwise. Later, the use of C (and G as a variant) replaced much of the use of K and Q. K remained only in some outdated spellings such as Kalendae, 'first day of the month'. When Greek words were absorbed into Latin, the letter Kapa was changed to C, with a few exceptions like the praenomen Kaeso. Some words from the rest of the alphabet were also transliterated into C. Therefore, the Romance language family only contains K in words from other languages. The Celtic language family also tended to use C rather than K, and that influence carried over into Old English. Nowadays, English is the only language of the Germanic language family that actively uses a hard C in addition to a K (although Dutch also uses a C in Latin loanwords and follows the law of the \"soft hard\" distinction in such words, as do French and English, but not the original Dutch vocabulary).", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "The meter (symbol: m; English: metre, French: m\u00e8tre) is the principal unit of length in the International System of Units (SI). After a redefinition in 2019, the definition of the meter, as mentioned in the ninth edition of the SI Brochure, is as follows. The meter, symbolized by m, is a unit of length in the SI. The unit is defined by obtaining a fixed numerical value of the rate of light in a vacuum c of 299,792,458 when expressed in units of m\u22c5s-1, with the definition of the second determined with respect to the cesium frequency \u2206\u03bdCs. The meter was originally defined in 1793 as one ten millionth of the distance from the equator to the North Pole along a great circle, making the circumference of the Earth approximately 40,000 km long. In 1799, the meter was redefined in terms of a prototype meter rod (the actual rod used was changed in 1889). In 1960, the meter was redefined in terms of the number of wavelengths of a particular krypton-86 emission line. The current definition was adopted in 1983 and modified slightly in 2002 to make it clear that the meter is a precise measure of length. The etymological roots of the word meter can be traced to the Greek verb \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03ad\u03c9 (metreo) (to measure, count or compare) and the noun \u03bc\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd (metron) (measure), which were used for physical measurements, for poetic meter and by extension for moderation or avoiding extremism (as in \"measured in your response\"). This range of usage is also found in Latin (metior, mensura), French (m\u00e8tre, mesure), English and other languages. The Greek word comes from the Proto-Indo-European root *meh\u2081- 'measure'. The motto \u039c\u0395\u03a4\u03a1\u03a9 \u03a7\u03a1\u03a9 (metro chro) in the badge of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM), which is a saying of the Greek statesman and philosopher Pittakus of Methylene and can be translated to \"Use measure!", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "\", calling for both measurement and moderation. The use of the word metre (for the French unit m\u00e8tre) in English dates back to at least 1797. The metre was originally defined by the French Academy of Sciences (Acad\u00e9mie des sciences) as the 110,000,000 distance along the Earth's surface from the North Pole to the equator via the Paris meridian in 1791, and on April 7, 1795 France adopted the metre as the official distance for length. Uncertainty in the measurement of such distances led the International Bureau of Measures and Weights (BIPM - Bureau International des Poids et Mesures) to establish 1 meter as the distance between two lines on a platinum-iridium rod kept in S\u00e8vres, France in 1889. In 1960, when the laser was introduced, the 11th General Conference on Measures and Weights (CGPM - Conf\u00e9rence G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Poids et Mesures) redefined the meter as 1,650,763.73 times the wavelength of the orange-red light spectrum of the krypton-86 atom in a vacuum. In 1983, the BIPM defined the meter as the distance light travels through a vacuum in 1299 792 458 seconds (the speed of light was set at 299 792 458 meters per second). Since the speed of light in a vacuum is the same everywhere, this definition is more universal than the distance measured by the Earth's circumference or the length of a particular metal rod. Therefore, if the metal rod is lost or destroyed, the standard meter length can still be repeated in any laboratory. In addition, meters can theoretically be measured more precisely than any other measure. The SI prefix can be used to indicate decimal multiples and sub-multiples of meters, as shown in the table below. Long distances are usually expressed in km, astronomical units (149.6 Gm), light years (10 Pm), or parsecs (31 Pm), rather than in Mm, Gm, Tm, Pm, Em, Zm or Ym; \"30 cm\", \"30 m\", and \"300 m\" are more common than \"3 dm\", \"3 dam\", and \"3 hm\".", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "Glucagon is an antagonist of insulin, which is secreted when blood sugar levels in the blood are low. Glucagon is produced in the alpha cells of the pancreas. Glucagon is produced from proglucagon, encoded by the GCG gene. The pancreas releases glucagon when the amount of glucose in the bloodstream is too low. Glucagon causes the liver to perform glycogenolysis: converting stored glycogen into glucose, which is then released into the bloodstream. High blood glucose levels, on the other hand, stimulate the release of insulin. Insulin allows glucose to be taken up and utilized by insulin-dependent tissues. Thus, glucagon and insulin are part of a feedback system that keeps blood glucose levels stable. Glucagon increases energy expenditure and increases under stressful conditions. Glucagon belongs to the secretin family of hormones. The primary structure of glucagon consists of 29 amino acids and has a molecular mass of 3483 Da. The sequence is: His-Ser-Gln-Gly-Thr-Phe-Thr-Ser-Asp-Tyr-Ser-Lys-Tyr-Leu-Asp-Ser-Arg-Arg-Ala-Gln-Asp-Phe-Val-Gln-Trp-Leu-Met-Asn-Thr. 1. The stimulus for glucagon secretion is the condition of hypoglycemia or if the concentration of amino acids drops in the blood after consumption of a protein-rich meal. However, the consumption of protein-rich foods stimulates the secretion of not only glucagon but also insulin. The action of autonomic nervous system neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine and adrenaline also stimulates glucagon secretion. 2. Inhibitors or those that inhibit glucagon secretion are conditions of hyperglycemia or if the blood sugar concentration rises. Other hormones that act as glucagon antagonists are: GHIH, GLP-1, GABA, secretin. Glucagon has the opposite effect to insulin, viz: Glucagon binding to its receptor will increase the concentration of cAMP, a second messenger in the cell.

At that time new music did not develop and there were no new creations in the bands that played, this was because the adherents of the old style only composed or wrote songs for commercial Swing music, and the new style was only formed by the players individually who with a conscious effort tried to make something new but it was only in the individual playing of their instruments and did not yet affect the musical style of the band as a whole.

In the Hall of Two Truths, Anubis weighs a person's heart against the feather of Ma'at, the goddess of righteousness who looks like an ostrich feather commonly seen in Ma'at's headdress If the heart is judged to be impure, it is Ammit's duty to eat it. The person whose heart is eaten by Ammit is not allowed to continue his journey to Osiris and immortality. Once eaten, his soul will be forever lost, which is also considered \"death the second time\". Ammit is also believed to guard the shores of a lake full of fire, where unworthy hearts are thrown into the lake to be destroyed. Some researchers also believe that Ammit's identity itself carries the same concept as destruction. Therefore, Ammit was feared rather than worshipped by the ancient Egyptians. Ammit is usually depicted with the head of a crocodile, the front legs and upper body of a lion (sometimes also depicted as the upper body of a leopard or tiger), and the hind legs and lower body of a hippopotamus. The combination of these three deadly predators suggests that no evil soul can escape Ammit's annihilation.", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "Kausalya (Sanskrit: \u0915\u094c\u0936\u0932\u094d\u092f\u093e, Kau\u015baly\u0101), also spelled Kosalya, is the name of a character in the Ramayana. She is known as the first wife of Dasarata, the king of Kosala Kingdom, who gave birth to Sri Rama. Based on her name, Kausalya is a princess from the Kingdom of Kosala. In Hindu literature, it is often found that the name of a princess refers to the country of her origin. For example, Gandari from the Gandhara Kingdom or Pancali from the Pancala Kingdom. In addition to Kausalya, Dasarata's consort, there are also several other figures with the same name in Hindu mythology. They are: In Javanese puppetry, Kausalya is called Sukasalya, the daughter of Banaputra, the king of Ayodya Kingdom. In addition, she is also known as Raguwati. When she was young, Sukasalya was paralyzed. Banaputra announced that he would marry Sukasalya to anyone who could cure his daughter's illness. It turned out that the one who succeeded in treating Sukasalya was Banaputra's own younger brother, Resi Rawatmaja. As a result, there was a marriage between uncle and nephew. One day the Kingdom of Ayodya was attacked by Ravana, the giant king of the Kingdom of Alengka. Banaputra was killed in the battle. Rawatmaja was also seriously injured. He told Sukasalya to take refuge with Dasarata before dying. Rawatmaja's friend in the form of a bird named Sampati was also defeated by Ravana. All his feathers fell out from Ravana's weapon. He then gave one of his feathers scattered on the ground to Sukasalya as an heirloom. By carrying Sampati's feather, Sukasalya was able to run faster to avoid Ravana's pursuit. Sukasalya took refuge with a young priest named Dasarata, who was his father's cousin from his mother's side. Dasarata was also friends with Jatayu, Sampati's younger brother. Initially he refused to protect Sukasalya because it was Ravana's right to have the daughter of a country he defeated.", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "Arenga saccharifera Labill. Enau or aren palm (Arenga pinnata, Arecaceae tribe) is the most important palm after coconut (nyiur) as it is a versatile plant. This plant is known by various names such as nau, hanau, peluluk, biluluk, kabung, juk or ijuk (various local names in Sumatra and Peninsular Malaya); kawung, taren (Sd. ); akol, akel, akere, inru, indu (languages in Sulawesi); beluluk (Sas. ); moka, moke, tuwa, tuwak (in Nusa Tenggara), and others. The Dutch know it as arenpalm or zuikerpalm and the Germans call it zuckerpalme. In English it is called sugar palm or Gomuti palm. Aren is a plant protected by law. A large and tall palm, it can reach 25 m in height. Up to 65 cm in diameter, the trunk is sturdy and covered at the top with black fibers known as palm fiber, injuk, juk or duk. The fibers are actually part of the leaf midrib that covers the stem. The leaves are pinnately compound, like coconut leaves, up to 5 m long with petioles up to 1.5 m long. The leaflets are wavy ribbon-like, up to 7 x 145 cm, dark green above and whitish due to the waxy coating on the underside. Monoecious, male flowers separated from female flowers in distinct cobs that appear in leaf axils; cobs up to 2.5 m long. The buni fruit is bullet-shaped, about 4 cm in diameter, three-bearded and three-seeded, arranged in chain-like strands. Each cluster has 10 or more stalks, and each stalk has approximately 50 green to yellowish-brown grains. The fruit cannot be eaten directly because the sap is very itchy. The enau tree produces many things, which makes it popular as a versatile crop, especially as a sugar producer.", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "Palm sugar is obtained by tapping the bunches of male flowers that begin to bloom and scatter yellow pollen. The bunches are first tempered by beating them for a few days, until liquid drips out of them. The bunch is then cut and a bamboo pole is hung at the end to catch the dripping liquid. The sweet liquid obtained is called nira (aka legen or saguer), which is clear and slightly cloudy. The nira does not last long, so the filled tahang must be collected immediately to process the nira; usually twice a day, in the morning and evening. Once collected, the nira is immediately cooked until it thickens and becomes liquid sugar. Next, a hardening agent (e.g. a mixture of jackfruit sap with several other ingredients) can be added to the liquid sugar so that the sugar freezes and can be molded into chunks of palm sugar (gula gandu). Alternatively, a separating agent such as coconut oil is added to the liquid sugar to form powdered (crystalline) palm sugar, also known as gula semut. In many parts of Indonesia, nira is also fermented into an alcoholic drink called tuak or saguer in the east. Tuak is obtained by adding one or more kinds of bark or roots (such as nirih bark (Xylocarpus) or a type of forest mangosteen (Garcinia)) to the nira and leaving it for one to several nights to process. Depending on the ingredients added, the resulting tuak can taste slightly sweet, slightly sour or bitter. By adding other ingredients, or by leaving it alone for a few days, the nira can ferment into vinegar. Vinegar from aren palm is no longer popular, pushed out by commercial vinegar. Raw (fresh) nira is laxative, so it is often used as an urus-urus medicine.", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "N is the 14th Latin letter. Its name is en (pronounced \u025bn]). One of the hieroglyphs in the form of a snake in Ancient Egypt was used to symbolize the sound of the letter J as in the word \"finger\", because the Egyptian word for \"snake\" sounds djet. It is believed that the Semites in Egypt adapted hieroglyphics to create the first alphabet, and therefore used the snake symbol for the /n/ sound, because the word \"snake\" in their language probably begins with this consonant, but the name of this letter in the Phoenician, Hebrew, Aramean and Arabic alphabets reads nun, which is \"fish\" in some of these languages. It sounds /n/, as in the Greek, Etruscan, Latin and all current languages. N functions as a dental nasal consonant or a dental-cavity nasal consonant in almost all alphabetized languages. In the International Phonetic Alphabet, the lowercase n] represents a dental consonant. A lowercase N (\u0274]) represents a nasal consonant sound. One of the bilinguals that includes the letter <n> is <ng>, which produces a back palate nasal consonant (pronounced \u014b]), as in the word \"sengau\". In English, n is usually not pronounced when followed by m, in words like hymn (although it is pronounced in the word damnation). In some words, n can represent the nasal consonant sound of the back palate, for example the words think (pronounced \u03b8\u026a\u014bk]) and bank (pronounced b\u00e6\u014bk]). n is the second most frequently used letter in the English language. The first is t. In some languages such as Italian and French, <gn> symbolizes the palate nasal consonant (/\u0272/).

Usually antifungal drugs must be prescribed by a doctor, but some are available over-the-counter. Polyenes are molecules that have many conjugated double bonds. Polyene antifungals are macrocyclic polyenes with a hydroxylated ring portion in the conjugated system. This makes polyene antifungals amphiphilic. These antifungals bind to sterols in the fungal cell membrane, especially ergosterol. This causes a change in the temperature transition (Tg) of the cell membrane, thus the inner membrane is less fluid and more of a crystallized state. (Under normal circumstances, membrane sterols increase the rigidity of the phospholipid bilayer thereby making the plasma membrane denser.) Thus, the contents of the fungal cell including monovalent ions (K+, Na+, H+, and Cl-), small organic molecules escape from the cell because the membrane is leaky and this is a way for the cell to die. Animal cells contain cholesterol instead of ergosterol so animal cells are not targeted by drugs. However, at therapeutic doses, some amphotericin B molecules can bind to cholesterol in animal cell membranes, increasing the risk of toxicity in humans. Amphotericin B is nephrotoxic when administered intravenously. With the hydrophobic chain on the polyene shortened, the binding activity with sterols increases. Therefore, the shortening of the hydrophobic chain may result in the polyene being able to bind to cholesterol, making it toxic to animals. Antifungal drugs of the azole class (except abafungin) inhibit the enzyme Lanosterol 14 \u03b1-demethylase; an enzyme required to convert lanosterol to ergosterol. Lack of ergosterol in the membrane in fungi impairs the structure and function of the membrane in fungi and results in inhibition of fungal growth.", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "Allylamines inhibit scualene epoxidase, another enzyme required for ergosterol synthesis. Examples of drugs of this class include Amorolfin, Butenafine, Naftifin, and Terbinafine. Used for systemic fungal infections in immunocompromised patients, Echinocandin inhibits the synthesis of glucan in the cell wall via the enzyme Beta (1-3) glucan synthase: Echinocandin is poorly absorbed when given orally. So it needs to be administered intravenously so that it is spread over most tissues and organs with concentrations in plasma that are sufficient to treat local and systemic fungal infections. Many antifungal drugs cause allergic reactions in people. For example, azole group drugs are known to cause anaphylaxis. There are also many drug interactions. Patients should read the information attached to the drug packaging. For example, the azole antifungals ketoconazole or itraconazole can be substrates and inhibitors of glycoprotein-P, which can excrete toxins and drugs into the gut. Azole antifungals are also substrates and inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 family CYP3A4, and cause increased plasma drug concentrations when administered with calcium channel blockers, immunosuppressants, chemotherapy drugs, benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants, macrolides and selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Before oral antifungal drugs are administered to treat nail disease, a diagnosis is required to confirm the disease is caused by a fungus. Half of the suspected cases of fungal infection in the nails are caused by non-fungals. The side effects of these medications are considerable and non-infected patients are not recommended to take these medications. Antifungals work by utilizing the differences between animal and fungal cells to kill fungal organisms with little side effects on the patient. Unlike bacteria, fungi and humans are eukaryotes.

There are two different legends regarding the birth of Aphrodite. The first version, mentioned by Homeros in the Iliad, says Afrodit was the daughter of Zeus and Dione, but this legend is less popular. The second version, based on Hesiodos' Theogonia, says that Afrodit was born from the genitals of Uranus that were cut off by the Titan Kronos and thrown into the sea. The genitals were covered by sea foam (aphros) and it was from the foam that Afrodit emerged. According to Plato in the Symposium, these two stories are true because they tell of two different Afrodites, namely Afrodit Urania and Afrodit Pandemos Because of her beauty, the gods feared that Afrodit would cause division among the gods, so Zeus married Afrodit to Hefaistos. However, Afrodit had many lovers, both among the gods, such as Ares, and among humans, such as Ankhises. Aphrodite is an important figure in the legend of Eros and Psikhe, and is also the adoptive mother and lover of Adonis. Many humans and minor gods are said to be the sons of Aphrodite. One of Afrodit's most famous sons is Eros (Cupid), the cupid. Afrodit was also known as Kithireia (Woman of Kythira) and Kipris (Woman of Cyprus) because both places were considered the birthplace of Afrodit. Myrtle plants, pigeons, sparrows, horses and swans were sacred to her. In Roman mythology, she was known as Venus. The Greeks also identified the ancient Egyptian goddess, Hathor, with Afrodit. Historically, her cult in Greece was derived from, or influenced by, the worship of the goddess Astarte in Punisia. Afrodit has many other local names, such as Akidalia, Kythereia and Kerigo, which are used in certain regions of Greece.", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "Each name had slight differences in terms of its cult but overall the Greeks recognized their commonality as one Afrodit. Attic philosophers in the fourth century BC separated the goddess Afrodit into two, the heavenly Afrodit (Afrodit urania) with her transender principles and the common Adoridt known to the people (Afrodit Pandemos). Afrodit has many equivalents in other mythologies, including Inanna (Sumerian mythology), Astarte (Funisian mythology), Astghik (Armenian mythology), Turan (Etruscan mythology), and Venus (Roman mythology). She has similarities to dawn goddesses from Indo-European mythology such as Ushas or Aurora. The cult of Afrodit originated in the east: according to Pausanias, her first cult was established in Assyria. Afterwards, the Funisians spread the cult of Afrodit to the people of Kythira. It is said that Afrodit was able to make all men fall in love with her at first sight. Afrodit also had many other names, such as Akidalia, Kythiria, Pandemos and Kerigo. These names were used in certain areas of Greece. When the Greek cities merged, these names were abandoned, and the name Arodit was used instead. The name Afrodit is associated with \u1f00\u03c6\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2 (aphros) \"foam,\" so sometimes Afrodit is translated as \"emerging from within the foam\". Other etymologies connect Afrodit with \u1f01\u03b2\u03c1\u03bf\u03b4\u03af\u03b1\u03b9\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 habrodiaitos (\"she who is soft\" from \u1f01\u03b2\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2 habros and \u03b4\u03af\u03b1\u03b9\u03c4\u03b1 diaita). Aphros, which appears in Messapic and Etruscan (later adapted to April), is probably of Greek origin as well. Although Herodotus realized that Afrodit was of Funisian origin, he still tried to find a connection between her name and the Semitic A\u0161toret, through an undocumented Hittite transmission, and the results were inconclusive. If Semitic in origin, then an incomprehensible etymology would emerge from bar\u012br\u012btu of Assyrian mythology, bar\u012br\u012btu being a female demon from Middle Babylonia and found in late Babylonian texts Her name likely means \"she who (comes) at dawn,\" a manifestation of the planet Venus as the morning star and an attribute of the goddess Inanna/Ishtar in Mesopotamian mythology.", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "Mortality is a measure of the average mortality of the population in a given area or region. In simple terms, mortality is the number of deaths due to certain diseases or natural deaths. Mortality is one of the important components of population. Population growth is determined by mortality. The object of mortality is all humans of all ages anywhere and anytime. Mortality is important information for the government and private sector in the fields of economics and health. Mortality problems cover the economic, social, customary, and environmental health fields. The improvement of community welfare by the central and local governments can be known through mortality indicators. The combination of information in the form of maternal mortality rates, infant mortality rates, child mortality rates, as well as the prevalence of malnutrition and life expectancy, is representative of the welfare level of the population. In addition, the magnitude of mortality determines the direction of a country's development. Mortality calculations consist of several types, such as: infant mortality rates, crude mortality rates, and mortality rates by age group. Mortality is different from morbidity which refers to the number of individuals who have an illness over a period of time. Specific mortality is defined as the number of specific deaths in a population multiplied by the size of the population per unit. Specific mortality expresses the unit number of deaths per 1000 individuals per year. Mortality is made as an independent concept in order to get a correct understanding. Advances in medical science have made it difficult to distinguish between dead and alive states clinically. Therefore, death was conceptualized to avoid different interpretations between different people about the conditions that can be declared as dead. Death is defined as the loss of all signs of life. These signs are permanently lost. Death can occur shortly after live birth. The concept of death in mortality is generally divided into newborn death, fetal death, neonatal death and infant death.", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "Newborn deaths are deaths that occur in infants. The age of the baby has not reached one month. Fetal death or stillbirth is the death of a fetus before it fully exits the mother's womb during the birthing process. The length of time the fetus is in the womb is not taken into account. Newborn death occurs in infants. The age of the baby has exceeded one month but has not reached the age of one year. While infant mortality is the death of an infant who has almost reached the age of one year. Mortality data is data that provides information about the cause of death. Mortality is one of the subjects of population economics. In economics, mortality is viewed specifically as a positive asset in development. However, the economic study of mortality is less developed than fertility. Mortality patterns also change and affect human welfare, but death is not considered an option. Mortality economics prioritizes choices other than death, namely sickness or health. The economic analysis of mortality is more developed towards health economics. Mortality measures or mortality indicators are numbers or indices used as a basis for determining the level of mortality in a population. The types of mortality measures vary, ranging from simple formulations to complex calculations. The mortality state of the population is generally not represented by a single measure of mortality, so usually several measures of mortality are used at once. Each type of mortality measure can also represent mortality-related conditions such as fertility and morbidity at a particular time period. Crude mortality rate is a number that indicates the number of deaths that occur per 1000 population. In the general case, deaths are more common in old age than in young age. The indications used in crude mortality rates are very simple because they do not take into account the effect of the age of the population.", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "Rudus is a sword or machete weapon associated with the Malay culture in Sumatra. Together with the pemandap sword, the Rudus is one of the largest-sized weapons in Malay culture. Rudus is also a symbol of several provinces on the island of Sumatra, such as Bengkulu Province in Sumatra, Indonesia. Rudus is associated with Malay Islamic culture. Rudus is more common in Sumatra than in the Malay Peninsula. Together with the pemandap, the Rudus is the symbol of the Malay Tribe in Sumatra. The Acehnese and the Malays of Bengkulu Province include the rudus as part of their cultural identity. The rudus is also the traditional weapon of the Banjar people in South Kalimantan, along with the kuduk weapon. During the Islamic period in Indonesia, the island of Sumatra was divided into small kingdoms that were at war with each other. Bengkulu province itself at that time had many sultanates, including the Sultanates of Sungai Serut, Selebar, Pat Petulai, Balai Buntar, Sungai Lemau, Sekiris, Gedung Agung and Marau Riang. Each of these small sultanates had their own soldiers and developed a variety of war weapons such as badik, rambai ayam and rudus to fight with other sultanates. Apart from being a weapon of war, the rudus was also used in the ceremonial appointment of the datuk, the customary chief. During the colonial period, the rudus was used by the natives as a form of resistance against the colonial government. Because of this romanticized patriotic notion where the rudus sword is used as a symbol of awakening against the oppressor, the rudus is often featured as a state or provincial symbol. One example is Bengkulu Province which uses the rudus in its coat of arms, in this case the rudus sword is a symbol of heroism.

Tropical is the adjective form. The word tropical comes from the Greek word tropos meaning \"turning\", because of the Sun's changing position between the two solstices in a period called a year. Areas belonging to tropical climates can be divided into the dry tropics which include steppes, dry savannas and deserts and the humid tropics which include tropical rainforests, monsoon areas and humid savannas. This area lies between 23.5\u00b0N and 23.5\u00b0N, and includes all parts of the Earth that experience the Sun directly overhead twice a year (north of GBU and south of GBS the Sun never reaches 90\u00b0 or directly overhead). Tropical plants and animals are species that live in the tropics. The term tropical is also sometimes used to refer to a place that is warm and humid all year round, even if it does not lie between the two equatorial lines. Plants of the tropics are usually broad-leaved and evergreen (not shedding leaves), or if they have shedding behavior they are not influenced by temperature or duration of solar radiation but rather by the availability of water in the soil. Tropical regions around the world are known in biogeography as pantropical regions (\"the entire tropics\"), to be contrasted with regions per continent, such as tropical America, or tropical Asia. \"Tropical\" is sometimes used in a generic sense for tropical climate meaning warm to hot and humid throughout the year, often with a feeling of lush vegetation.", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "Many tropical regions have a dry season and a wet season. Areas with wet seasons are disseminated throughout the tropics and subtropics. Under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, for tropical climates, a wet season month is defined as a month in which the average rainfall is 60 millimeters (2.4 in) or more. Tropical rainforests technically have no dry or wet season, as rainfall is evenly distributed throughout the year. Some areas with a pronounced rainy season experience a decrease in rainfall during mid-season when the intertropical convergence zone or monsoon trough moves north poleward of their location during midsummer; typical vegetation in these regions ranges from seasonally moist tropical forest to savanna. When the rainy season occurs during the warm season, or summer, rainfall falls mainly in the afternoon and evening. The rainy season is a time when air quality improves, freshwater quality improves and vegetation grows significantly, leading to harvests later in the season. Flooding causes rivers to overflow their banks, and some animals retreat to higher ground. Soil nutrients are reduced and erosion increases. Malaria incidence increases in areas where the rainy season coincides with high temperatures. Animals have adaptation and survival strategies for wetter regimes. The previous dry season leads to food shortages into the wet season, as crops are not yet ripe. However, regions in the tropics may not have a tropical climate. Under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, most areas within a geographic region are classified not as \"tropical\" but as \"arid\" (dry or semi-arid), including the Sahara Desert, Atacama Desert and Australian Outback.

In Indonesian, this letter is called ce (pronounced t\u0283e]). In Classical Latin, this letter represents the phoneme /k/, a voiceless back palate eruptive consonant, while in Indonesian and Malay it represents the phoneme /t\u0283/, a voiceless post-cavity-tooth friction consonant. 'C' and 'G' come from the same letter. The Semites called it gimel (Arabic: jim). The symbol is adapted from Egyptian hieroglyphics in the shape of a stick sling, which may be the meaning of the name gimel itself. Another possibility is that the symbol depicts a camel, which in the Semitic language family is called gamal. In Etruscan, explosive consonants have no contrastive voicing, so the Greek letter \u0393 (Gamma) was adapted into the Etruscan alphabet to represent the phoneme /k/. Even in the Western Greek Alphabet, Gamma first took form in the Early Etruscan alphabet, then in Classical Etruscan. Later in Latin it took the form of C in the classical Latin alphabet. Early Latin letters used C for the consonants /k/ and /\u0261/, but during the third century BC, an altered letter was introduced to symbolize the sound /\u0261/, and C itself was assigned to symbolize the sound /k/. The use of the letter C (and its variation G) largely replaced the use of K and Q. Thus, in antiquity and beyond, G has been known to be phonetically equivalent to Gamma, and C to Kappa, in the transcription of Greek words into Latin spelling, as in the words KA\u2206MO\u03a3, KYPO\u03a3, \u03a6\u03a9KI\u03a3, in Roman letters written CADMVS, CYRVS, PHOCIS.

The Old English or \"Anglo-Saxon\" writing learned from the Kelts was, in fact, Irish; hence the C in Old English also originally stood for /k/; Modern English words like kin, break, broken, thick, and seek all come from Old English written with C: cyn, brecan, brocen, \u00deicc, and s\u00e9oc. But during the Old English period, /k/ before the front vowels (/e/ and /i/) underwent palatalization, changing to the t\u0283] sound in the tenth century, although C was still used, as in the words cir(i)ce, wrecc(e)a. Meanwhile in mainland Europe, similar phonetic changes also occurred (for example in Italian). In Folk Latin, /k/ is palatalized to t\u0283] in Italy and Dalmatia; in France and the Iberian peninsula, it becomes ts]. However, C is still used before front vowels (E, I) with different sound values. Furthermore, the phoneme /k\u02b7/ in Latin (written as qv) is uninflected so that it becomes the sound /k/, meaning that Romance languages contain the sound /k/ before front vowels.

The company is the fifth largest sogo shosha, and leads the market share of cereal and paper pulp trading, as well as having strong power and industrial businesses. Marubeni is a member of the Mizuho keiretsu. Marubeni was founded in 1918 under the name Itochu Shoten, Ltd. as a result of the separation of the sales division of C. Itoh & Co. (Itochu). Itochu Shoten later merged with Itoh Chobei Shoten in 1921 to form Marubeni Shoten, Ltd. under the leadership of Chobei Itoh IX. Initially engaged in textile trading, the company expanded into trading consumer goods and other industrial goods during the 1920s. Marubeni was later merged with Itochu during World War II to form Sanko Kabushiki Kaisha Ltd. (1941-44) and Daiken Company, Ltd. (1944-48). Daiken was broken up after the war ended and Marubeni re-emerged as a separate company in 1949. Marubeni focused on the textile trading business, and later expanded into machinery, metals, chemicals, so textile trading was no longer its main business. In 1955, Marubeni merged with Takashimaya-Iida, a trading company that owned the Takashimaya department store chain, and changed its name to Marubeni-Iida from 1955 to 1972. The merger was guided by Fuji Bank to create a stronger trading company for Fuji Bank's clients. Marubeni and Fuji Bank then developed a client network that was formalized as the keiretsu Fuyo Group in the 1960s, alongside the development of the DKB Group and Sanwa Group. The Fuyo Group includes Hitachi, Nissan, Canon, Showa Denko, Kubota, and Nippon Steel.", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "Marubeni was hit by a number of scandals in the 1970s and 1980s. In the early 1970s, Marubeni was accused of hoarding rice on the black market to make a profit. In 1976, a number of Marubeni All Nippon Airways executives were arrested in connection with the bribery of Japanese government officials to support the sale of Lockheed-made airplanes in Japan. The scandal led to several suicides and the arrest of Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka. In 1986, Marubeni was found guilty of bribing Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos and a number of his friends and acquaintances in connection with ODA projects in the Philippines. Like other sogo shosha, Marubeni was severely affected by the bursting of the asset price bubble in Japan in the early 1990s and recorded its first loss in 1998. The company posted another large loss as part of its restructuring in 2001, with its share price dropping to 58 yen in December 2001. In 2006, Marubeni acquired a minority stake in supermarket chain Daiei which was sold to \u00c6on Group in 2013. In January 2012, Marubeni Corporation agreed to pay a US$54.6 million penalty to settle Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) charges related to its role as an agent for the TSKJ joint venture. The joint venture consisting of Technip, Snamprogetti Netherlands, Kellogg Brown & Root (KBR), and JGC Corporation hired Marubeni to bribe Nigerian government officials to help TSKJ obtain and maintain a contract to build a liquefied natural gas facility on Bonny Island, Nigeria. TSKJ paid Marubeni US$51 million, part of which was intended as bribe money for Nigerian government officials.

Adrastos was the son of Talaos and Lisimakhe. According to Pausanias, Adrastos' mother was Lisianassa, while Higinus says his mother was Eurinome. Adrastos was one of the three kings of Argos, the others being Ifis and Amfiaraos, who married Adrastos' sister Erifile. Adrastos was probably married to Amphithea, daughter of Pronax, or to Demonassa. Adrastos' daughters were Argia and Deipile who were married to Polinikes and Tideus. His other sons were Aigiale, Aigialios, and Kianippos. In a feud between the major families in Argos, Talaos was killed by Amfiaraos, and Adrastos was deposed from power. Adrastos fled to Polibus, king of Sikion. Polibus died without an heir so Adrastos succeeded him as king of Sikion. During his reign, Adrastos organized the Nemeos Race. Adrastos made peace with Amfiaraos, gave him his sister in marriage, and returned to rule in Argos. Adrastos returned to Argos riding Herakles' immortal horse Arion. During his reign, Tideus of Calidonia and Polinikes of Thebes, both fugitives in their respective countries, met in Argos near the palace of Adrastos. They quarreled and fought. Hearing the commotion, Adrastos came and separated them. When he saw them, Adrastos realized that they were the men who were predicted to be the husbands of his daughters; Adrastos then married his daughter Deipile to Tideus, and Argia to Polinikes, he also promised to make them return to power in their respective countries. Adrastos prepared for war with Thebes even though Amfiaraos had predicted that all involved would die, except Adrastos.

Adrastos fled to the city of Athens and begged the Athenian king, Theseus, to attack Thebes and take back the bodies of the fallen heroes. Theseus initially refused but his mother, Aithra, convinced him to do so. The Athenian army finally attacked Thebes and conquered it. But they did no damage and only took what they came for, the bodies of the heroes. The heroes were given a proper burial and Adrastos praised their fight... Ten years later, Adrastos persuaded the sons of the fallen heroes to attack Thebes again, and Amfiaraos now predicted that they would win. This war was called the Epigoni War. Thebes was conquered and razed to the ground, after most of the population had fled the city on the advice of Tiresias. The only Argos hero who died in this war was Aigialios, the son of Adrastos. After finishing building the temple of Nemesis in the settlement of Thebes, Adratos intended to return home. But Adrastos died and was buried in Megara due to old age and grief over the loss of a son. After his death, he was worshipped in several areas in Greece, such as in Megara, in Sikion where he is remembered, and in Attika.

It is caused by various strains of mycobacteria, most commonly Mycobacterium tuberculosis (abbreviated as \"MTb\" or \"MTbc\"). Tuberculosis usually affects the lungs, but can also affect other parts of the body. Tuberculosis is spread through the air when a person with active TB infection coughs, sneezes, or spreads their saliva droplets through the air. Most TB infections are asymptomatic and latent (often called latent TB). However, one in ten cases of latent infection progresses to active disease (active TB). If tuberculosis is left untreated, more than 50% of infected people can die. Before the discovery of powerful antibiotics to treat TB (around the early 1900s) an estimated 1 in 7 people in the world died from the disease. The classic symptoms of active TB infection are a chronic cough with blood in the sputum or phlegm, fever, night sweats, and weight loss. (TB used to be called \"consumption\" disease because infected people usually lose weight). Infections of other organs cause a variety of symptoms. The diagnosis of active TB depends on radiology (usually chest x-ray) as well as physical examination and microbiological culture. Meanwhile, the diagnosis of latent TB relies on the tuberculin skin test (TST) and blood test (IGRA). Treatment of active TB requires regular administration of multiple antibiotics over a period of 6 to 12 months. People in contact should also be screened and treated if necessary. With the current development of antibiotics, a well-conducted TB treatment will give a cure rate of over 90%.", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "However, often if treatment is not carried out regularly and for the required period of time, the TB bacteria can relapse and adapt to become resistant to antibiotics. Antibiotic resistance is a major problem in managing the TB epidemic. Multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) infections require much more severe treatment with much higher drug doses and much lower cure rates. To prevent TB, everyone should undergo a screening test for the disease and get vaccinated against the Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin bacillus. Experts believe that one-third of the world's population has been infected by M. tuberculosis, and new infections are occurring at a rate of one person per one second. In 2007, there were an estimated 13.7 million active chronic cases globally. By 2010, an additional 8.8 million new cases and 1.5 million deaths are expected, mostly in developing countries.

There is an opinion that Scorpion and Narmer were the same person, but no identification has been made that can be proven.

Annas was the father-in-law of Caiaphas. They lived in the region of Judea. Annas was a high priest who served from 6-15 AD. He was appointed by the Roman legate Cyrus as the first High Priest in the new Roman province of Iudaea in 6 AD; soon after the Roman government removed Archelaus, the Ethnarch of Judaea, and brought Judaea directly under Roman rule. Annas was deposed at the age of 36 by Valerius Gratus in 15 AD.

According to some commentaries of the Gospels of Luke and John, Annas was probably the priest who interrogated Jesus in court. This is supported by the interpretation that Annas was still referred to as High Priest, even though he had been formally dismissed. Annas' influence was still recognized in his court duties. This is in accordance with the Jewish legal tradition that the high priest is a lifelong position. However, the official high priest at the time was Caiaphas who was supposed to preside over Jesus' trial. The Gospel of John can provide better information on Jesus' trial in the priests' court, because John was a disciple who was rarely away from Jesus. In addition, John was well known in the court of Caiaphas and those around him. In John's testimony, Annas did not defend Jesus at all.

Perhaps because of this, Annas was still called \"High Priest\" after being deposed by the Roman government, and at one time served with Caiaphas (Luke 3:2). He may have been the president of the Sanhedrin, or a coadjutor of the High Priest. Luke 3:2 indicates a joint High Priesthood between \"Annas and Caiaphas\" at the time the Word of God was revealed to John the son of Zechariah in the wilderness. The involvement of Annas' family may be implied in the plot to kill Lazarus of Bethany in John 12:10. Although Annas is not mentioned by name in that account, some 19th century writers such as Johann Nepomuk Sepp and Abb\u00e9 Drioux, assume there is a hidden reference to Annas in the parable of the \"rich man and Lazarus\" which involves a \"rich man\" with five brothers. If the rich man dressed in purple and fine linen (compare Exodus 28:8) represents Caiaphas, as the leader of the Sadducees at the time, then Annas is the \"father\" in Luke 16:27, and the \"five brothers\" of Luke 16:28 are the five sons. Luke 16:28 are the five sons of Annas. There is a kind of \"coincidence\" that the father and the five brothers were not convinced even though Lazarus in the parable was brought back from the dead (Luke 16:31) which foretold that Caiaphas, Annas, and the five sons of Annas, would not believe, and even intended to kill the real Lazarus who was raised from the dead (John 12:10). According to the Gospel of John (which is not recorded in the other Gospels), Jesus Christ was first brought before Annas, and after a brief interrogation (John 18:19-23) was sent to the house of Caiaphas, where a number of Sanhedrin members had gathered, who then held the first trial of Jesus (Matthew 26:57-68).", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "Keyence Corporation (\u30ad\u30fc\u30a8\u30f3\u30b9, K\u012bensu) is a direct sales organization that develops and manufactures automation sensors, vision systems, barcode readers, laser markers, measuring instruments, and digital microscopes.

He fought to establish the kingdom but later died as a victim of slander during the reign of the second king of Majapahit, Jayanegara. Pararaton and Kidung Harsa Wijaya narrate that Nambi was the son of Arya Wiraraja. On the other hand, Kidung Harsa Wijaya and Kidung Sorandaka tell that Nambi was the son of Pranaraja. There was a long debate in which Slamet Muljana stated that Nambi was the son of Pranaraja while Ronggolawe was the son of Arya Wiraraja. However, in his latest analysis Mansur Hidayat]] argued that both Nambi and Ronggolawe are possible sons of Arya Wiraraja. Pararaton and Kidung Panji Wijayakrama mention Nambi as one of Raden Wijaya's servants who fled to Arya Wiraraja's place in Songeneb (the old name of Sumenep) when the Singasari Kingdom collapsed under Jayakatwang's army in 1292. Meanwhile, according to Kidung Harsawijaya, Nambi was the son of Arya Wiraraja who had just met Raden Wijaya in Songeneb. Pararaton says that Nambi is a son of Arya Wiraraja who has been a friend of Raden Wijaya since he became one of the commanders in Singhasari. Kidung Harsawijaya also tells the story that Nambi was then sent by his father to help Raden Wijaya open the Tarik Forest (on the border between Sidoarjo district and Mojokerto district) into a residential village called Majapahit. This story contradicts Kidung Panji Wijayakrama and Kidung Ranggalawe, which name the son sent by Arya Wiraraja as Ranggalawe, not Nambi. Pararaton further tells the story, when Raden Wijaya attacked Kadiri in 1293, Nambi was instrumental in killing a follower of Jayakatwang named Kebo Rubuh. In various fields of struggle, Nambi was told of a person who had administrative and intellectual ingenuity so that when Majapahit was established he was trusted to be the first Maha Patih of this kingdom.", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "Pararaton tells the story after Jayakatwang's defeat in 1293, Raden Wijaya founded the Majapahit Kingdom and appointed himself king. The position of patih or a kind of prime minister was given to Nambi. This news is reinforced by the Sukamerta inscription in 1296 which lists the names of Majapahit officials, including Rakryan Patih Mpu Tambi. According to Kidung Panji Wijayakrama and Kidung Ranggalawe, it was this appointment of Nambi that triggered Ranggalawe's rebellion in Tuban in 1295. Ranggalawe was dissatisfied with the decision because Nambi was considered less meritorious in war. With Raden Wijaya's permission, Nambi left to lead the Majapahit army to attack Tuban. In that war, Ranggalawe died at the hands of Kebo Anabrang. According to Mansur Hidayat]], the author of the history, Arya Wiraraja and Lamajang Tigang Juru, Nambi was one of Arya Wiraraja's sons who continued to play a role in the establishment of the Majapahit kingdom. His appointment as Maha Patih was not approved by his own brother, Ranggalawe, who wanted Lembu Sora, his maternal uncle, to become Patih because he was considered to have courage. As a result of this war with Ranggalawe, Ranggalawe, who was Arya Wiraraja's favorite son, died, making his father sad and very angry. Arya Wiraraja then built a fortified capital city which became known as Arnon or Kuto Renon ang in ancient Javanese language is \"Kuto means fortified city\" and \"Renon or Renu means angry\". So Kutorenon itself means a fortified capital built out of anger. As a result of this incident Nambi was not accepted by Arya Wiraraja until his illness in 1314 AD. In the Majapahit government itself, Mpu Nambi was one of the loyal supporters of the Rajasa Dynasty, so when Prabu Jayanagara ascended the throne and replaced Tribuwana Tunggadewi, Mpu Nambi was at the forefront of opposing him.", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "Metrology (the science of measurement) is the scientific discipline that studies the ways of measurement, calibration, and accuracy assurance in industry, science and technology.Metrology covers three main things, namely: Metrology is categorized into three main categories with varying degrees of complexity and accuracy: Fields of Metrology Scientific Metrology is divided by BIPM (Bureau International des Poids et Mesures), the International Bureau of Weights and Measures into 9 technical fields: The legality of metrology in Indonesia is based on the Law of the Republic of Indonesia No. 2 of 1981 concerning Legal Metrology (UUML) which regulates matters concerning the manufacture, distribution, sale, use, and inspection of measuring instruments, measures, weights and equipment. In accordance with the mandate of the UUML, Government Regulation (PP) No. 2 of 1989 concerning National Standards for Units of Measure (SNSU) was enacted which outlines the establishment, management, maintenance and use of SNSU as the highest reference for measurements applicable in Indonesia. A number of government institutions have also carried out this role, including the Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI), the Food and Drug Administration (BPOM), the Ministry of Environment (MOE) and the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries. Research and development of metrology at LIPI has been initiated since the 1960s in a number of fields by researchers in various units / work units under it. Especially for metrology in the field of physics, research and development of metrology was carried out by researchers at the National Instrumentation Institute, which later changed its name to the work unit of the Center for Research and Development (Puslitbang) Calibration, Instrumentation and Metrology (KIM) LIPI in 1984. PPOMN of the National Agency of Drug and Food Control (BPOM) has since 1990 served as a national reference laboratory and CRM producer in the field of drug and food testing.

This Decree mandates the establishment of a KSNSU organization coordinated by the National Standardization Agency (BSN). To support BSN, the technical scientific management of SNSU was handed over to the Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI). Furthermore, this Keppres clearly explains that the executor of SNSU management is a work unit at LIPI that has competence in the field of metrology. At that time, Puslit KIM-LIPI was the organizational unit under LIPI whose field of activity was most related to the management of national standards. Thus, it can be said that Puslit KIM-LIPI is a government agency that functions as the National Metrology Institute (NMI) in Indonesia. This is further strengthened by the change in the name of Puslit KIM to Puslit Metrology in 2014, which shows the increasing focus of LIPI on metrology development. However, all SNSUs maintained and provided by Puslit KIM LIPI are the highest standards in Indonesia for physics measurements only, such as length, time, mass and related quantities, electricity, temperature, radiometry and photometry, and acoustics and vibration. Puslit KIM LIPI does not have a reference standard or Certified Reference Material (CRM) for chemical measurements and does not maintain SNSU for measurements in the field of nuclear radiation because these two measurement fields are not included in its scope of competence. So it can be said that the function of NMI Puslit Metrology is only limited to the field of physics. In fact, more than 70% of the tests conducted in Indonesia are chemical tests. To complete this shortcoming, in 2007 LIPI gave a mandate to the Chemical Research Center (Puslit) as the Scientific Technical Manager of National Standards for Units of Measure in the field of Chemical Metrology.", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "Cheese is a food that is produced by separating the solids in milk through a thickening or coagulation process. This thickening process is done with the help of certain bacteria or enzymes called rennet. The result of this process will later be dried, processed, and preserved in various ways. From a single milk, a wide variety of cheese products can be produced. Cheese products vary depending on the type of milk, curdling method, temperature, cutting method, drying, heating, as well as the cheese ripening and curing process. Generally, the animal that is used as a source of milk is the cow. Camel, goat, sheep, horse or buffalo milk is used in some local types of cheese. It is known all over the world, but is thought to have been first recognized in areas around the Middle East. Although it is not certain when cheese was first discovered, according to legend it was first discovered by accident by an Arabian traveler. Cheese contains almost all the nutrients found in milk, such as protein, vitamins, minerals, calcium, and phosphorus, but also fat and cholesterol, which can cause health problems if consumed in excess. The amount of fat in cheese depends on the type of milk used. Cheese made with whole milk or cream has a high fat, cholesterol and calorie content. Cheese is beneficial because it is rich in protein, especially for young children as they need more protein than adults. Cheese has been produced since prehistoric times although there is no definitive evidence of when cheese making was first practiced. Prehistoric people began to abandon the nomadic lifestyle and switched to raising goats, sheep and cows. Due to lack of hygiene, direct exposure to sunlight or heat from fire, the milk in the vessels became sour and thick.", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "After trying it out, the milk was still edible, and that was the first time humans discovered sour cream cheese. Sweet cream cheese was also discovered by chance. A legend tells that some hunters killed a calf, opened its stomach and found something white that tasted good. The presence of rennet enzyme in the cow's stomach caused the milk to become thick, thus becoming what we call cheese today. Another story says that cheese was first discovered in the Middle East by a traveler from Arabia. The traveler was traveling in the desert on a horse with milk in his saddle. After a while, the milk had turned into pale water and white clots. Since the saddle was made from the stomach of an animal (cow, goat or sheep) that contained rennet, the combination of rennet, hot weather and shaking while riding the horse turned the milk into cheese, and people started using enzymes from animal stomachs to make cheese after that. Ancient Greek mythology credits Aristaeus as the inventor of cheese. Homer's Odyssey (800 BC) says that Cyclops made cheese by using and storing sheep and goat milk. Goat's milk cheese was an important commodity in Greece, and they believed that cheese could make officers stronger and stimulate lust. Hippocrates used cheese to treat inflammation, and cheese was also an offering to the gods. It was the Roman culture that later developed the various types of cheese that we know today.

Medicine encompasses a wide range of healthcare practices that evolve to maintain and restore health by prevention and treatment of disease. Contemporary medicine uses biomedical science, biomedical research, genetics, and medical technology to diagnose, treat, and prevent injuries and diseases, usually through drugs or surgery, but also through diverse therapies, including psychotherapy, external splinting and traction, medical devices, biopharmaceuticals, and radiotherapy. Medicine has been around for thousands of years, much of which has been practiced as an art (an area of skill and knowledge) and often has links to religious beliefs and local cultural philosophies. For example, a shaman would use medicinal plants and pray for healing or ancient philosophers and doctors would bleed according to the theory of humoralism. In recent centuries, since the advent of modern science, most medical practices are a combination of art and science (both basic and applied sciences, under the umbrella of medical science). Meanwhile, the technique for performing sutures is an art learned through practice and the knowledge of what happens at the cellular and molecular level to the sutured tissue emerges through science. Pre-scientific forms of medicine are now known as traditional medicine and folk medicine. They remain commonly used with or in place of scientific medicine and are thus called alternative medicine. Meanwhile, treatments outside the boundaries of safety and efficacy according to medical science are referred to as quackery.

Systems of medicine and healthcare practices have evolved in various human societies since at least the beginning of recorded human history. These systems have evolved in different ways, in different cultures, and in different regions. Modern medicine generally refers to the medical traditions that have developed in the Western world since the beginning of modern times.

His teachings questioned existing Indo-Iranian religious traditions and inaugurated a movement that eventually became the dominant religion in ancient Persia. His mother tongue was Old Avesta, and he lived in the eastern part of the Iranian Plateau, but his exact birthplace is unknown. There is no scientific consensus on when he lived. Some researchers, using linguistic and socio-cultural evidence, place his life around the 2nd millennium BC. Others estimate him to have lived in the 7th and 6th centuries BC as a near-contemporary of Cyrus the Great and Darius I. Zoroastrianism then became the official religion of Ancient Persia and its scattered offshoots from the 6th century BC to the 7th century AD. Zoroaster is credited as the author of the Gathas as well as the Yasna Haptanghaiti, hymns composed in his mother dialect, Old Avesta, which contain the core of Zoroastrian thought. Much of his life is known from these texts.

Siena is known for the Palio, a horse race held twice a year, its medieval cityscape, museums, art, and cuisine. Siena, like other Toskan hill towns, first became a settlement during the Etruscan period (ca. 900-400 BC) when it was inhabited by a tribe called the Saina. The Etruscans were an advanced people who changed the face of central Italy through their use of irrigation to reclaim previously uncultivable land, and through their habit of building settlements on well-defended hill fortresses. A Roman city called Saena Julia was founded on the site during the time of Emperor Augustus. The first document to mention it is dated 70 AD. citation needed] Some archaeologists assert that Siena was under the control of a Gallic tribe, called the Senones, for a period.

It is said that, after the murder of their father by Romulus, they fled Rome and took with them a statue of a she-wolf suckling babies (Lupa Capitolina), thus taking the symbol for the city.

Other etymologies suggest that the name Siena comes from the Etruscan surname Saina, the Roman surname Saenii, the Latin word senex \"old\" or also its derivative form seneo \"to grow old\". Siena did not prosper under Roman rule. It was not located near any major roads and had no opportunities in trade. Its limited status meant that Christianity was not recognized in Siena until the 4th century AD, and the city only experienced prosperity when the Langobardi (Lombards) invaded Siena and the surrounding region. After the Langobardi occupation, the Via Aurelia and Via Cassia, two ancient Roman roads, crossed areas that were targeted by the Byzantines, so the Langobardi diverted much of their trade between their northern territories and Rome to the safer route through Siena. Siena prospered as a trading post, and the constant flow of pilgrims to and from Rome became a valuable source of income throughout the following centuries. The first aristocratic families in Siena drew their lineage from the surrender of the Langobardi in 774 to Charlemagne. At this time, the city was filled with a flock of Frankish overseers who married into the Sienese nobility of the time and left a legacy that can be seen in the monasteries they founded throughout Siena. However, feudal power waned, and with the death of Contessa Matilde in 1115 the frontier territory of the Mark of Tuscia that had been under the control of her family, Canossa, split into several autonomous regions.

You will see greater things than these.\" Then Jesus said to him: \"Most assuredly, I say to you, you will see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.\" Scholars believe that Jesus' words about Nathanael \"under the fig tree\" is a term that means \"to study the Torah.

Although jugs have been known since the early days in Java and the Malay Archipelago, historically they originated from India, which had already known them in an older civilization. It is also suspected that the glazed jugs of Southeast Asia are not just an imitation of India but an evolution of Mesopotamian and Greek jugs.

The findings of jugs in ancient settlements provide an important insight into the trade patterns and cultural relations found in different periods in the area with other regions such as India, the Middle East, Mesopotamia, Greece, China, and others. Jugs come in two types: plain and patterned. Jugs are usually used for drinking and Javanese ceremonies. Egyptians make jugs that are carved according to their culture. The Chinese make jugs patterned with dragon images. Thais make two types of jugs, plain and patterned. Indonesians make plain jugs, but they have handles for lifting. But in general, jugs take the shape of a pumpkin as inspiration for creation. This is possible, given that dried gourds were one of the first water containers used before people used pottery. Pottery drinking water containers that were originally thought to mimic the shape of the fruit are still being made and created today, such as in areas in Sulawesi. Actually, the shape of the jugs that exist today is not much different from the jugs of the past. Perhaps the variations are the only difference. However, when observed in general there are two basic forms, namely the first is bottle-shaped, round body and neck, the neck function as a place to fill and pour water.

The history of interferon discovery began in 1954 when Nagano and Kojima discovered it in a virus in rabbits. Three years later, Isaacs and Lindenmann isolated a similar molecule from chicken cells and it was called interferon. There are three classes of interferons namely, alpha, beta, and gamma. Interferons, especially alpha and beta have an important role in defense against viral infections. Interferon compounds are part of the non-specific immune system and they are induced in the early stages of a viral infection, before the specific immune system responds to the infection. When a biological stimulus occurs, interferon-producing cells release it into the environment so that it can bind to target cell receptors and induce transcription of 20-30 genes in target cells. This results in an anti-viral state in the target cell. Activation of interferon proteins can sometimes lead to cell death which can prevent further infection of the cell. Interferon-\u03b1 and -\u03b2 have been used to cure various viral infections, one of which is certain chronic and acute hepatitis C and B can use interferon-\u03b1. Meanwhile, interferon-\u03b3, which plays a role in macrophage activation, is used in curing lepromatous leprosy, toxoplasmosis, and leishmaniasis. The anti-proliferative effect of interferon also means that it can be used to treat tumors such as melanoma and Kaposi's sarcoma.

This term is actually inappropriate. A better use of the pair would be Theravada - Mahayana, rather than Hinayana - Mahayana. Hinayana means small vehicle, indicating the smaller number of followers of Buddhism compared to the Mahayana (large vehicle) school. The Hinayana school is also called the Theravada school.Hinayana is a school of Buddhism that emphasizes the purity and authenticity of Buddhism as taught by Siddharta Gautama Buddha. Unlike Mahayana which uses Sanskrit, Hinayana uses Pali in worship and the Tripitaka texts. Today the main base of Hinayana followers is spread from Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. Between the 1st century BC and 1st century AD, both the terms Mahayana and Hinayana appear in the Saddharma Pundarika Sutra or \"Lotus Sutra of Virtuous Teachings\". Around the 2nd century AD, Mahayana was clearly defined. Nagarjuna developed the Mahayana philosophy of \"emptiness\" and proved that everything is \"Empty\" in the small book \"Madhyamika-karika\". Around the 4th century, Asanga and Vasubandhu wrote many Mahayana books. After the 1st century CE, the Mahayana established itself and the terms Mahayana and Hinayana became known thereafter. Hinayana and Theravada are not the same term. Theravada refers to the Buddhism that entered Sri Lanka towards the 3rd century BCE when there was no Mahayana at that time. The Hinayana school developed in India and was independent of the Buddhism in Sri Lanka. Today there is no Hinayana tradition anywhere in the world. Therefore, in 1950 the World Fellowship of Buddhists formed in Colombo unanimously decided that the term Hinaya should be dropped when referring to Buddhism as it exists today in Sri Lanka, Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos and others.", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "Galendo (Sundanese: \u1b8c\u1b9c\u1ba6\u1b94\u1baa\u1b93\u1ba7, translit.

This typical Ciamis food made from cooked coconut pulp is usually served as a snack or dessert. Currently, galendo can be found in souvenir shops in East Priangan with many variations in flavor, shape, and price. In the past, Ciamis was the largest coconut producer in West Java. At that time, Raden Adipati Aria Kusumahdiningrat or known as Kanjeng Prabu, the Regent of Galuh Ciamis who served from 1839-1886 developed coconut until it developed and became the largest coconut producer in West Java at that time. At that time, the biggest use of coconut fruit was to make coconut oil. A sizable coconut oil factory at the time was called Gwan Hien which was located on Jalan Jenderal Achmad Yani, Ciamis; but now it is no longer operating due to lack of raw materials. Because at that time the pulp from making coconut oil was quite a lot, finally the pulp was made into a snack which is now called galendo. This typical food of Ciamis Regency has a number of nutritional contents, including protein from coconut fruit and fat from coconut oil. The reduction of oil from the food can be a natural preservative so that no additional preservatives are needed to make galendo durable, and the galendo is not sticky so it can be eaten with other foods.

Members of this family are also called felids (/\u02c8fi\u02d0l\u026ad/). The term \"cat\" refers to members of the felidae in general and specifically to domestic cats (Felis catus). Felidae species exhibit the most diverse coat patterns of all land carnivores. Cats have retractable claws, slender muscular bodies and strong flexible front legs. Their tooth structure and facial muscles allow them to have a powerful bite. All Felidae are obligate carnivores, and most are solitary predators that ambush or stalk their prey. Feral cats are found in Africa, Europe, Asia and the Americas. Some wild cat species are adapted to forest habitats, dry environments, wetlands, and mountainous areas. Their activity patterns range from nocturnal and crepuscular to diurnal, depending on their preferred prey species. Reginald Innes Pocock divided the extant Felidae into three subfamilies: Pantherinae, Felinae, and Acinonychinae, distinguished from each other by the hardening of the hyoid apparatus and the skin sheath protecting their claws. This concept has been revised following developments in molecular biology and morphological data analysis techniques. Today, the living Felidae are divided into two subfamilies: Pantherinae and Felinae, the Acinonychinae belonging to the latter group. Pantherinae includes five species of Panthera and two of Neofelis, while Felinae includes another 34 species in ten genera. The first cats appeared during the Oligocene period, about 25 million years ago, with the appearance of Proailurus and Pseudaelurus.

They control the fate of every human being from birth to death. In Roman mythology they are known as the Parkae. They are also mentioned in cultures derived from Proto-Indo-European mythology. The role of the moirai is to ensure that all beings, both mortal and immortal, live out their destiny that has been decided based on the laws of the universe. For mortals, their destiny is represented as a spool of thread from a spinning wheel. In general, they are above the other gods in their role as regulators of destiny, though in some representations Zeus as the leader of the gods can rule over them with his power. In Homer's poem Moira or Aisa plays a role in the limits and end of life, and Zeus appears as the guide of destiny. In Hesiod's Theogonia, the three Moirai are personified, daughters of Nyx and acting above the gods. The basic universe concepts of natural order and balance have also been compared to concepts in other cultures such as the Vedic Rta, the Avestan Asha, and the Egyptian Maat. In ancient Greek, moira (\u03bc\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c1\u03b1) means part or lot of the whole, and the word is related to meros meaning part or lot and moros meaning destiny, fate, or death.

Many relics of the Mycenaean religion survived into the classical Greek era, but it is not known to what extent the religious beliefs of classical Greece were Mycenaean, or how much a product of the Greek Dark Ages or more recent times. Moses I. Finley detected only a few original Mycenaean beliefs in the world of Homer in the 8th century. One such belief was the existence of a role in events not ascribed to spirits or daemons, which appeared in special events. Martin P. Nilsson attributes the daemons to a pre-Greek hypothetical religion. Mycenaean philosophy emphasizes in the influence of events and actions on fate and acceptance of the inevitability of the natural order; which is now known as fatalism. The concept of moira refers to a fair division or share, which was originally related to the share of booty from battles, which was distributed according to strict tradition. This idea eventually began to be applied to one's fair share in life. Obtaining more than one fair share (\u03c5\u03c0\u03ad\u03c1 \u03bc\u03bf\u03af\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd \"more than a share\") of the loot or life in general was possible, but it would result in severe consequences as it was considered a violation of the natural order. For example in a passage from the Illiad, Apollo tries three times to stop Patroklos from robbing Troya, and warns him that doing so would be \"more than his portion\". In particular, the most important parts of the natural order are birth and death. Eventually, the concept of one's share of destiny began to be personified as a spirit or daemon, referred to as Aisa or Moira, who would determine the exact time of one's death at the time of one's birth.

The term is most commonly used to refer to the Javanese script and the Balinese script, and is also used to refer to similar scripts that are derivatives or modifications of these two scripts. The name Hanacaraka comes from the first five letters in the traditional Javanese series. This is equivalent to the word \"alphabet\" derived from the names of the first two letters in the Greek alphabet (A-B, alpha-beta) and the word \"abjad\" derived from the first four letters in the Arabic alphabet (\u0627-\u0628-\u062c-\u062f, alif-ba-jim-dal).

The hanacaraka sequence has been used by pre-independence Javanese society since at least the 15th century when the Javanese domain began to receive significant Islamic influence, and was only adapted in Bali at the end of the 19th century due to the introduction of folk schools and printed textbooks that were already commonplace in Java at that time.

Javanese script is derived from the Indian Brahmi script through the intermediary of the Kawi script and is closely related to the Balinese script. It was actively used in Javanese literature and everyday writing from the mid-15th century to the mid-20th century before its function was gradually replaced by Latin letters. It is still taught in Yogyakarta, Central Java and East Java as part of local content, but with limited application in daily life. In its development until the 20th century, Javanese script was used throughout the island of Java at a time when communication between regions was often difficult. As a result, Javanese script had various historical and regional styles that were used alternately over time. These regional styles, including the Javanese script used for non-Javanese languages such as Sundanese (Cacarakan) and Madurese, are commonly known as hanacaraka. The tradition of writing in Javanese script was mainly nurtured within the palaces of Javanese cultural centers such as Yogyakarta and Surakarta, but manuscripts in Javanese script were created and used in various layers of Javanese society with varying intensity of use between regions.

Together with the Archaea domain, bacteria are classified as prokaryotes. Bacterial cells have a specific shape, for example resembling a ball, rod, or spiral, which is usually a few micrometers in size. Bacteria were one of the first life forms to emerge and today inhabit most habitats on Earth. Bacteria can live in soil, water, acidic hot springs, radioactive waste, and the Earth's crust. Bacteria also establish symbiotic relationships with plants and animals. Most bacteria are not characterized, and only about 27 percent of bacterial phyla have species that can be grown in the laboratory. The study of bacteria is called bacteriology, a branch of microbiology. Almost all animals depend on bacteria to survive because only bacteria and some archaea have the genes and enzymes needed to synthesize vitamin B12. This vitamin is obtained by animals through the food chain or produced by microorganisms living in their digestive system. There are about 40 million bacterial cells in one gram of soil and one million bacterial cells in one milliliter of fresh water. Overall, there are about 4-6 x 1030 bacteria and archaea on Earth, which make up a biomass surpassed only by plants. Bacteria are instrumental in nutrient cycling, for example in the binding of atmospheric nitrogen and the decomposition of dead bodies.

The majority of bacteria in the body are harmless because the body is protected by the immune system. In addition, many bacteria are beneficial, especially as gut flora. However, some species of bacteria are pathogenic and cause infectious diseases, including cholera, syphilis, gonorrhea, anthrax, leprosy and bubonic plague. The most common deadly bacterial disease is respiratory infection. Tuberculosis kills about two million people a year, mostly in Sub-Saharan Africa. Antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections and are also used in agriculture, which makes antibiotic resistance a growing problem. In industry, bacteria play an important role in waste treatment and decomposition of oil spills, production of cheese and yoghurt through fermentation, refining gold, palladium, copper and other metals in the mining sector, and in biotechnology such as the manufacture of antibiotics and other chemicals. Bacteria are microscopic organisms that are difficult to detect, especially before the invention of the microscope. They were first observed in 1676 by Antony van Leeuwenhoek, a Dutch merchant and scientist. He used a single-lensed microscope that he designed himself. Leeuwenhoek then published his observations in a series of letters to the Royal Society of London, which were later published in English in 1684. Bacteria were objects that were within the limits of what Leeuwenhoek's simple lens could see and no one else could see them for more than a century. Leeuwenhoek also observed protozoa, all of which he referred to as \"little animals\". Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg, a German scientist, introduced the word bacterium in 1838.

Its status as a transit country is the beginning of a meeting point for cultures from all over the world. The country is the geographical setting of the Panama Canal, which was designed to facilitate communication between the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean coasts and significantly influenced global trade. The world's current geographical position offers a broad platform of marine, commercial real estate and financial services, including the Colon Free Zone, the largest free zone on the continent and second in the world. With a population of more than three million inhabitants, it has a privileged position in various rankings of growth and development in Latin America, as the human development index (first in Central America and fourth in Latin America). The country is ranked in absolute terms, i.e. without taking into account the distribution of wealth, income as medium-high. Panama was part of the Spanish colony in the Americas until 1821 when it separated and joined Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar's Gran Colombia. It can be said that to a certain extent, Panama's history has been a slave to its geography. This is true of its early history as well as its recent history. Indeed, much of Panama's domestic politics and international diplomacy in the 20th century was linked to the Panama Canal. In the mid-20th century, Theodore Roosevelt's vision of an interoceanic sea route prompted US diplomatic efforts to facilitate a treaty that would allow it to take over the French operation of the canal begun by Ferdinand de Lesseps.

This treaty sparked many contentious diplomatic issues between the US and Panama until the signing of the Torrijos-Carter Treaty in 1977. The Panamanian government went through political instability and corruption throughout its history, the mandate of the elected president was terminated early. In 1968, General Omar Efrain Torrijos took over the government of the country and was the real strongman of Panama until his death in an airplane disaster in 1981. After Torrijos' death, political power was finally centralized in the hands of General Manuel Antonio Noriega. Relations with the US deteriorated in the late 1980s. In December 1989, the US invaded Panama. The death of a US soldier in Panama at the hands of a Panamanian Defense Force roadblock was one of the reasons for George Bush to announce the invasion, named Operation Just Cause. However, according to the Panamanian government at the time, the officer's vehicle was trying to breach the roadblock, which was located near a sensitive military site. The attack occurred just a day before the administration of the Panama Canal was to be handed over to Panama, according to a schedule designed in the Torrijos-Carter Treaty. After the attack, Manuel Noriega sought asylum at a Vatican diplomatic mission, but after a few days he surrendered to the US military.

According to some classical Marxist opinions, and some theories of social evolution, post-capitalist societies may emerge as a result of spontaneous evolution as capitalism becomes obsolete. Others advocate models that intentionally replace capitalism. Most prominent among these are socialism and anarchism. In 1993, Peter Drucker outlined the possible evolution of capitalist society in his book, Post-Capitalist Society. The book argues that knowledge - rather than capital, land or labor - is the new basis of wealth. The classes of a fully post-capitalist society are expected to be divided into knowledge workers or service workers, as opposed to capitalists and proletariats in a capitalist society. In the book, Drucker estimates that the transformation to post-capitalism will be completed by 2010-2020. Drucker also advocates rethinking the concept of intellectual property by creating a universal license system. Consumers can subscribe for a fee and producers can assume that everything is reproduced and distributed through social networks. In 2015, according to Paul Mason, rising income inequality, repeated cycles of economic booms and downturns, and capitalism's contribution to climate change have prompted economists, political thinkers and philosophers to begin seriously considering how a post-capitalist society might look and function. Post-capitalism is expected to take place with further advances in automation and information technology - both of which effectively make the cost of production likely to approach zero.

Although there are many polyesters, the term \"polyester\" as a specific material more often refers to polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Polyesters include natural chemicals, such as rutin from the bark of plants, as well as synthetic chemicals such as polycarbonate and polybutyrate. Produced in various forms such as sheets and 3-dimensional shapes, polyester as a thermoplastic can change shape after being heated. Although flammable at high temperatures, polyester tends to curl away from the flame and self-extinguish during combustion. Polyester fibers have high strength and E-modulus as well as low water absorption and minimal shrinkage when compared to other industrial fibers. Woven polyester fabrics are used in consumer apparel and home furnishings such as bed linens, bed covers, curtains and draperies. Industrial polyester is used in tire reinforcement, rope, fabric for conveyor belts, seat belts, coated fabrics and plastic reinforcement with a high level of energy absorption. Polyester fiber fill is also used to fill pillows and warm blankets. Polyester fabrics are said to feel \"unnatural\" when compared to similarly woven fabrics from natural fibers (e.g. cotton in textile use). However, polyester fabrics have some advantages such as increased resistance from wrinkling. As a result, polyester fibers are sometimes spun together with natural fibers to produce garments with combined properties. Polyester is also used to make bottles, films, tarpaulins, canoes, liquid crystal displays, holograms, filters, dielectric films for condensers, insulation for cables and insulation tapes. Liquid crystalline polyester is one of the first industrially used liquid crystalline polymers and is used for its mechanical properties and heat resistance.", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "That advantage is important in its use as a scraper-resistant seal in jet engines. Thermosetting polyesters are used as casting materials, and chemosetting polyester resins are used as fiber glass coating resins and non-metallic car body putty. Fiber glass reinforced unsaturated polyester is widely used in the body parts of yachts and automobiles. Polyesters are also widely used as finishes in high quality wood products such as guitars, pianos, and the interior of vehicles/yachts. Burns London, Rolls-Royce, and Sunseeker are just a few companies that use polyester to refine their products. The thixotropic properties of spray-curable polyester make it ideal for use on open-grain logs, as it fills the grain quickly, with a firmly established mat thickness per layer. The cured polyester can be sanded and polished into the final product. Polyesters are one of the most economically important polymer classes, driven primarily by PET, which is among the commodity plastics; in 2000 about 30 million tons were produced worldwide. The variation in structure and properties within the polyester family is enormous, depending on the nature of the R group (see first image with blue ester group). Polyesters found in nature include the kutin component of plant cuticles, which consists of omega hydroxy acids and their derivatives, interlinked via ester bonds, forming polyester polymers of indeterminate size. Polyesters are also produced by bees in the genus Colletes, which secrete a plastic-like polyester coating for their underground brood cells earning them the nickname \"polyester bees\".

Her parents were Tindareus and Leda but her biological father was the god Zeus, who raped Leda in the form of a swan. In another version, Helene was the daughter of Zeus and the goddess Nemesis. Helene was born from an egg and she was the sister of Klitaimnestra and Dioskuri (Castor and Polideukes). She had a very beautiful appearance, even in mythology referred to as \"the most beautiful woman in the world\", so she was desired by many kings in Greece but in the end she was married to Menelaos of Sparta. Paris, a Trojan prince, took Helene away from Sparta. This angered Menelaos so Troya was attacked by the Greek kings and the Trojan War ensued. After Troya was destroyed, Helene returned to Sparta with her husband. The oldest record of Helene is in the verses of Homeros, and the myth of Helene probably dates back to the Mykenai period. In ancient Greece, Helene was also worshipped in temples and sanctuaries. The center of Helene worship was in Sparta. Meanwhile, the story of Helene's escape with Paris is a popular theme in visual arts. Her depiction often appears from Ancient Greek urn paintings to Renaissance paintings. The etymology of Helene's name has been a problem for historians even today. Georg Curtius connected Helene (\u1f19\u03bb\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7) with the moon (Selene, \u03a3\u03b5\u03bb\u03ae\u03bd\u03b7). \u00c9mile Boisacq proposes that Helene comes from the noun elene (\u1f10\u03bb\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7) which means \"torch\". There is also an opinion that the letter \u03bb in the name \u1f19\u03bb\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7 is derived from the letter \u03bd, and thus the origin of the name is related to the root Venus. However, Linda Lee Clader states that none of these explanations are satisfactory.", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "If the name Helene is of Indian-European origin, then it may be a suffixed form of the root *wel- \"to twist, roll\", or perhaps of the word *sel- \"to flow, run\". This also allows for a comparison of Helene with the Vedic Sanskrit Sara\u1e47y\u016b, a kidnapped figure in Rigweda 10.17.2. This equivalence indicates the Indian-European-Early Abduction myth. Sara\u1e47y\u016b means \"swift\" and is derived from the adjective sara\u1e47a (\"that which flows\", \"swift\"), the feminine form of which is sara\u1e47\u0101, which sounds similar to Helena (\u1f19\u03bb\u03ad\u03bd\u03b1), a form of her name that has no initial digama. The possible connection between Helene and elene (\"torch\") as mentioned above may also support Helene's association with the svaran\u0101 (\"shining one\") of the Vedas. The Helene myth dates back to the Mykenai period. The oldest record of Helene's name is in the verses of Homeros, but historians assume that her myth was created or accepted by the Mykenai Greeks before it reached Homeros. In mythology, Helene's birthplace is in Sparta during the Age of Heroes, which features heavily in Greek mythology. The Age of Heroes that the ancient Greeks believed in is what historians today call the Mykenai Bronze Age. The kings, queens and heroes of the Trojan Cycle were often associated with the gods, as their mythical origins gave high status to the heroic ancestors of the Greeks. The fall of Troya symbolizes a fall in the age of heroes, which for centuries was remembered through oral tradition before being written down.

Dimetrodon is a member of the Sphenacodontidae family. Dimetrodon's most prominent feature is the dorsal spine screen on its back formed by elongated vertebrae. It walked on four legs and had a tall, bent skull with a large set of teeth that each differed in size along its jaws. Most fossils are found in the Southwestern United States, the majority of its fossils coming from the Red Beds of Texas and Oklahoma. More recently, its fossils have been found in Germany. More than a dozen species have been named since the genus was named in 1878. Dimetrodon is often mistaken for a dinosaur or a contemporary of dinosaurs in popular culture, but this animal was extinct some 40 million years before the first appearance of dinosaurs. Although physiologically and in appearance more reptile-like, Dimetrodon was more closely related to mammals than modern reptiles, although it was not a direct ancestor of lactating animals. Dimetrodon was included in the \"non-mammalian synapsids\" group, a group traditionally - but incorrectly - referred to as \"mammal-like reptiles\", and now known to be stem mammals. This leaves Dimetrodon grouped with mammals in a clade (evolutionary group) called Synapsida, while dinosaurs, reptiles and birds are grouped in a separate clade, Sauropsida. A single opening in the skull behind each eye, known as the temporal fenestra, and other skull features separate Dimetrodon and mammals from most early sauropsids. Dimetrodon was likely one of the apex predators in the Cisuralium ecosystem, feeding on fish and tetrapods, including reptiles and amphibians.", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "Smaller Dimetrodon species may have had ecological roles. Dimetrodon sails may have been used to stabilize its spine or heat and cool its body as a form of thermoregulation. Some recent studies have argued that its sails may not have been effective at removing heat from its body because large species are found with small sails and small species are found with large sails, essentially ruling out heat regulation as its primary function. Its sails were most likely used for mating demonstrations by methods such as threatening rivals or showing potential mates. Dimetrodon was a dominant predator, and one of the largest of its era. It could grow 3 - 3.8 meters (10-12 feet) long. The name Dimetrodon means 'two sizes of teeth', because it had a large skull with two different types of teeth, unlike reptiles. Dimetrodon walked on four legs beside its body and had a large tail; it is thought that Dimetrodon walked in the same way as modern lizards. The most interesting part of Dimetrodon's appearance was the amazing fin on its back (other pelycosaurs like Edaphosaurus, Ianthasaurus, and Sphenacodon also had this). These fins, which were full of blood vessels, may have been used to regulate its body temperature; the surface of its skin allowed it to warm or cool its body more efficiently. This adaptation is important because it can increase its hunting time. These fins may also be used to attract mates or warn off other predators. These fins are also supported by nerves, each sprouting from its spine. Bramwell and Fellgett (1973) calculated that a 200 kg Dimetrodon could raise its body temperature from 26 \u00b0C to 32 \u00b0C in 205 minutes without fins and only 80 minutes with fins.

It was first isolated from potash en], the ash of plants, the origin of its English name. In the periodic table, potassium is one of the alkali metals. All alkali metals have one valence electron in their outermost electron petal, which is easily released to form a positively charged ion - a cation, which when combined with an anion forms a salt. Potassium in nature exists only in ionic salts. Elemental potassium is a soft, silvery-white, alkali metal that oxidizes rapidly in air and reacts violently with water, generating enough heat to ignite the hydrogen emitted in the reaction and burn with a purple flame. It is found dissolved in seawater (which is 0.04% potassium by weight), and is part of many minerals. Potassium is chemically very similar to sodium, the previous element in group 1 of the periodic table. They have the same first ionization energy, which allows each atom to give up its only outer electron. That they are different elements that combine with the same anion to make similar salts was suspected in 1702, and proved in 1807 using electrolysis. Natural potassium consists of three isotopes, of which one, 40K is radioactive. Traces of 40K are found in all potassium, and it is the most common radioisotope in the human body. Potassium ions are necessary for the function of all living cells. The transfer of potassium ions through nerve cell membranes is necessary for normal nerve transmission; potassium deficiency and excess can each result in many abnormalities, including abnormal heart rhythms and various electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities.", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "Fresh fruits and vegetables are good source foods of potassium. The body responds to an influx of dietary potassium, which increases serum potassium levels, by shifting potassium from the outside into the cells and increasing potassium excretion by the kidneys.

Heavy crop production rapidly depletes soil potassium, and this can be counteracted with potassium-containing fertilizers, accounting for 95% of global potassium production. The English name: potassium for the element potassium comes from the word \"potash\", which refers to an early method of extracting various potassium salts: firewood ash or tree leaves were put into a pot, water was added, heated, and the solution was evaporated. When Humphry Davy first isolated the pure element using electrolysis in 1807, he named it potassium, which he derived from the word potash.

The Semitic letter D\u00e2let most likely developed from a logogram meaning \"fish\" or \"door\". There are various Egyptian hieroglyphs that may have inspired it. In Semitic languages, Ancient Greek and Latin, it represents the consonant /d/; in Etruscan alphabets it is ostensibly unnecessary, but still preserved (see letter B). Its Greek equivalents are: \u0394 (large) or \u03b4 (small) (Delta). The shape of the lowercase \"d\", which consists of one curve and one high vertical line, evolved from the varied changes in the shape of the uppercase \"D\". In ancient writing it was customary to start the curve to the left of the vertical line, resulting in a serif above the curve. This serif was joined as other parts of the letter were reduced, resulting in an angular stem and arch. Then this angular stem turns into a vertical stem.

In German, the letter d sounds /d/ (voiced cavity-teeth erupted consonant), but changes to /t/ (voiceless cavity-teeth erupted consonant) if at the end of a word. In Fijian, this letter represents the prepanasal inhibited consonant /nd/. In some languages where a voiceless inhibition consonant without exhalation is opposite to a voiceless inhibition consonant with exhalation, d represents /t/ without exhalation, while t also sounds /t\u02b0/ with exhalation.", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "The pallium or pala (Latin: pallium or palla, literally \"woolen coat\") is one of the ecclesiastical vestments of the Roman Catholic Church, originally reserved for the Pope, but for centuries afterward it was also bestowed by the Pope on metropolitan bishops and primates as a symbol of the jurisdiction conferred on them by the Holy See. The present pallium is a sash, \"three fingers wide,\" woven from the wool of white lambs kept by the Trappist monks, looped over the shoulders above the Kasula, and the two ends dangling front and back respectively; thus when viewed from the front or back the pallium forms the letter Y. The pallium is decorated with six black crosses, one on each dangling part and four on the looped part, double on the left shoulder, embossed front and back, with three gold pins. The last two characteristics seem to be a legacy from the days when the Roman pallium was still a simple scarf worn around the neck, crossed and held together with safety pins on the left shoulder. Originally the pallium and omophorion were the same vestiment. The omophorion was a broad cloth sash, larger than the modern pallium, worn by all Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic bishops of the Byzantine Rite. The theory linking the pallium to the figure of the Good Shepherd carrying a lamb on his shoulders, so common in Christian art, is obviously an a posteriori explanation. But the ceremony associated with its preparation and presentation to the Pope suggests similar symbolism. The lambs whose wool would later be used in making the pallium were solemnly offered on the altar by the nuns of the convent of Saint Agnes. The awarding of pallium became controversial during the Middle Ages, as popes charged a special rate for pallium users.", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "The imposition of this tariff saddled the papacy with hundreds of thousands of gold pieces and diminished the reputation of the pallium. The process was condemned by the Council of Basel in 1432, which called it \"the most usurious act ever committed by the papacy.\" The tariff was later abolished as it was accused of being a form of simony. For the occasion of his inauguration, Pope Benedict XVI switched to an earlier model pallium, from a time when the pallium and omophorion were still virtually identical. The pallium is wider than the modern pallium but not as wide as the modern omophorion, made of black silk-tipped wool, and decorated with five red crosses, three of which are pinned, symbolizing the five wounds of Christ and the three nails of the cross. Only the Papal pallium takes this special form. Today only the Pope and metropolitan bishops wear the pallium, and a metropolitan bishop must receive the pallium before serving a term in his ecclesiastical province, even if he has previously been a metropolitan bishop in another area. Ordinary bishops, nonmetropolitan bishops or metropolitan bishops emeritus are not allowed to wear the pallium unless they have special permission. For example, Angelo Cardinal Sodano, the newly elected Chairman of the College of Cardinals, obtained the special right to wear the pallium in the suburbicarian diocese of Ostia on June 29, 2005. The modern pallium is a circular sash, about two inches wide, draped around the neck, shoulders and chest. The pallium has two strands each at the front and back, about two inches wide and about twelve inches long, each end of the two strands wrapped in black silk. The rest of the pallium is made of white wool, derived from two lambs offered annually as a tax from the monastery of St. John according to the rules of the Lateran canons on the memorial day of St. Agnes (January 21, the name Agnes means \"lamb\"), solemnly blessed on the main altar of St. Agnes Church after Pontifical Holy Mass, then presented to the Pope.", "language": "indonesian"}]
