This term is probably first used by Pythagoras (c. 570\u2013495SM). The methods used in philosophy include asking questions, critical discussion, dialectics, and systematic presentations. Classical philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know everything and prove it? What's the most real? Philosophers also ask more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be fair or unfair (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will? Historically, philosophy encompasses the core of all knowledge. From the time of Ancient Greek philosophers such as Aristotle until the 19th century, natural philosophy encompassed astronomy, medicine, and physics. For example, Newton's Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy in 1687 is later classified as a physics book. In the 19th century, the development of modern university research ushered in professionalized and specialized academic philosophy and other disciplines. In the modern era, several investigations that were traditionally part of philosophy have become separate academic disciplines, some of which are psychology, sociology, linguistics, and economics. Other investigations closely related to art, science, politics and several other fields remained part of philosophy. For example, is beauty objective or subjective? Are there many scientific methods or is there only one? Is political utopia a hopeful dream or a vain delusion? The main sub-fields of academic philosophy include metaphysics (dealing with the nature of reality and being), epistemology (concerning \"the origins and fields of knowledge and] ... their limits and validity\" ), ethics, aesthetics, political philosophy, logic, philosophy of science , and the history of western philosophy.",

This last form is more similar to the original. In Indonesian a person who studies philosophy is called a \"philosopher\". knowledge. In this sense, philosophy is closely related to religion, mathematics, natural science, education, and politics. \"Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy\", Newton's work in 1687 was classified in the 2000s as a physics book; he used the term \"philosophy nature\" because the term was used to cover scientific disciplines later associated with science such as astronomy, medicine, and physics. In classical times, Philosophy t is traditionally divided into three main branches: This division is not obsolete but has changed. Natural philosophy has divided into various natural sciences, especially astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology, and cosmology. Moral philosophy has given birth to the social sciences, but still includes value theory (including aesthetics, ethics, political philosophy, etc.). Metaphysical philosophy has given birth to formal sciences such as logic, mathematics and the philosophy of science, but still includes epistemology, cosmology and others.",

Chalmers and others, on the other hand, see progress in philosophy as similar to progress in science. Meanwhile Talbot Brewer argues that \"progress\" is an erroneous standard by which to judge philosophical activity. In one general sense, philosophy is associated with wisdom, intellectual culture, and the pursuit of knowledge. In this regard, all literate cultures and societies ask philosophical questions such as \"how do we live\" and \"what is the nature of reality\". A broad and impartial conception of philosophy thus leads to a rational investigation of such questions as reality, morality and life in all world civilizations. Western philosophy is the philosophical tradition of the Western world and originates from Pre-Socratic thinkers who were active in ancient Greece in the 6th century BC. such as Thales (c. 624-546 BC) and Pythagoras (c. 570-495 BC) who practiced \"love of wisdom\" (philosophia) and were also called physiologoi (students of physis, or nature). Socrates was a very influential philosopher, who insisted that he had no wisdom but was a pursuer of it. Western philosophy can be divided into three eras: Ancient (Greco-Roman), Medieval philosophy (Christian Europe), and modern philosophy. The ancient era was dominated by the teachings of Greek philosophy that arose from some of Socrates' students, such as Plato who founded the Platonic Academy. Plato is one of the most influential Greek thinkers in all of Western thought. Plato's student Aristotle was also very influential, he founded the Peripatetic School. Other traditions include Cynicism, Stoicism, Greek Skepticism and Epicureanism. Important topics covered by the Greeks included metaphysics (with competent theories such as atomism and monism), cosmology, the nature of good life (eudaimonia), the possibility of knowledge and the nature of reason (logos).",

Medieval philosophy (5th - 16th centuries) was the period after the fall of the western Roman empire and was dominated by the rise of Christianity and therefore reflected Judeo-Christian theological concerns while also maintaining continuity with Greco-Roman thought. Issues such as the existence and nature of God, the nature of faith and reason, metaphysics, the problem of evil are discussed in this period. Some of the major thinkers of the Middle Ages include St. Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, Boethius, Anselm and Roger Bacon. Philosophy for these thinkers is seen as a support for theology (ancilla theologiae) and because of that they try to harmonize their philosophy with their interpretation of the scriptures. This period sparked the development of Scholasticism, a text-critical method developed in medieval universities based on the close reading and debate of key texts. The Renaissance period (1355-1650) saw more of an increased focus on classical Greco-Roman thought and the strong influence of humanism. Early modern philosophy in the Western world began with thinkers such as Thomas Hobbes and Ren\u00e9 Descartes (1596-1650). Following the development of the natural sciences, modern philosophy focused more on developing a rational and secular foundation of knowledge, moving away from traditional structures of authority such as religion, scholastic thought and the Church. Major modern philosophers include Spinoza, Leibniz, Locke, Berkeley, Hume, and Kant. Nineteenth-century philosophy was influenced by a wider movement called the Enlightenment, and included figures such as Hegel, a key figure in German idealism, Kierkegaard, who developed the foundations for existentialism, Nietzsche, a famous anti-Christian, JS Mill, who promoted Utilitarianism, Karl Marx who developed the foundations for Communism and the American William James. The 20th century witnessed the split between analytic philosophy and continental philosophy, as well as philosophical trends such as phenomenology, existentialism, logical positivism, pragmatism and linguistics.",

Early wisdom literature from this area was a school that sought to instruct people in ethical conduct, practical life and virtue through stories and proverbs. In Ancient Egypt these texts were known as sebayt (teachings) and they are very important to our understanding of Ancient Egyptian philosophy. Babylonian astronomy also includes many philosophical speculations about cosmology that may have influenced the Ancient Greeks. Jewish philosophy and Christian philosophy are religious-religious traditions that developed in both the Middle East and Europe, both having certain early Judaic texts (notably the Tanakh) and monotheistic beliefs. Jewish thinkers such as Geonim of the Talmudic Academy in Babylon and Maimonides were involved with Greek and Islamic philosophy. Later Jewish philosophy came under strong Western intellectual influence and included the works of Moses Mendelssohn which ushered in the Haskalah (the Jewish Enlightenment), Jewish existentialism and Reform Judaism. Pre-Islamic Iranian philosophy begins with the work of Zoroastrian, one of the first promoters of monotheism and the dualism of good and evil. This dualistic cosmogony later influenced the development of Iranian philosophies such as Manichaeism, Mazdakism, and Zurvanism. After the Muslim conquests, Early Islamic philosophy developed the Greek philosophical tradition in new innovative directions. This Islamic Golden Age influenced the intellectual development of Europe. The two main currents of early Islamic thought were the Kalam which focused on Islamic theology and the philosophy based on Aristotelianism and Neoplatonism. Aristotle's work was very influential among philosophers such as al-Kindi (9th century), Avicenna (980 - 10 June) and Ibn Rushd (12th century).",

Indian philosophy (Sanskrit: dar\u015bana; 'worldview', 'teaching') is a philosophical tradition originating in the Indian subcontinent. Indian philosophical traditions are generally classified as orthodox or heterodox - \u0101stika or n\u0101stika - depending on whether they accept the authority of the Vedas and whether they accept the theories of Brahman and Atman. The orthodox schools generally include Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Samkhya, Yoga, M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 and Vedanta, and the common heterodox schools include: Jains, Buddhists, Aj\u00f1ana, Ajivika and C\u0101rv\u0101ka. Some of the earliest surviving philosophical texts are the Upanishads of the Late Vedic period (1000-500 BC). Important Indian philosophical concepts include: dharma, karma, samsara, moksha and ahimsa. Indian philosophers developed a system of epistemological reasoning (pramana) and logic, the topics investigated included metaphysics, ethics, hermeneutics and soteriology. Indian philosophy also covers topics such as political philosophy as seen in Arthashastra c. 4th century BC, and the philosophy of love as seen in the Kama Sutra. Six commonly encountered orthodox schools emerged during the early General Era and the Gupta Empire. This Hindu school developed from \"synthetic Hinduism\" incorporating orthodox brahmanical and unorthodox elements from Buddhism and Jainism as a way of responding to unorthodox challenges.

The early modern era saw the rise of Hindu nationalism, the Hindu reform movement and Neo-Vedanta (or Hindu modernism) whose main supporters included Vivekananda, Mahatma Gandhi and Aurobindo and for the first time promoted the idea of \u200b\u200b\"one Hinduism\". Due to the influence of British colonialism, most modern Indian philosophical works are in English, including works by thinkers such as Radhakrishnan, Krishna Chandra Bhattacharya, Bimal Krishna Matilal and M. Hiriyanna. Buddhist philosophy begins with the thought of Gautama Buddha (between the sixth and fourth centuries BCE) and is preserved in early Buddhist texts. Buddhist thought is trans-regional and trans-cultural. This thought originated in India and then spread to East Asia, Tibet, Central Asia, and Southeast Asia, developing new and syncretic traditions in these different areas. Several schools of Buddhist thought are the dominant philosophical traditions in Tibet and Southeast Asian countries such as Sri Lanka and Burma. Since ignorance of the true nature of things is considered one of the roots of suffering (dukkha), Buddhist philosophy is concerned with epistemology, metaphysics, ethics and psychology. The ending of dukkha also includes the practice of meditation. Key innovative concepts include the Four Noble Truths, Anatta (not self) a critique of fixed personal identity, impermanence (Anicca), and a skepticism of metaphysical questions.

East Asian philosophical thought dates back to Ancient China, and Chinese philosophy began during the Western Zhou Dynasty and in the period following its fall, when the \"One Hundred Schools of Thought\" flourished (6th century to 221 BC). This period was marked by significant intellectual and cultural developments and the rise of China's main philosophical teachings, Confucianism, legalism, and Taoism, as well as many other less influential teachings. This philosophical tradition developed metaphysical, political and ethical theories such as Tao, Yin and Yang, Ren and Li which, along with Chinese Buddhism, directly influenced Korean philosophy, Vietnamese philosophy and Japanese philosophy (which also includes the original Shinto tradition). Buddhism began to arrive in China during the Han dynasty (206 BC-220 AD), through the gradual transmission of the Silk Road and through native influences that developed distinct forms of the Chinese language (such as Chan/Zen) that spread across East Asian cultures. During subsequent Chinese dynasties such as the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) and also in the Joseon dynasty (1392-1897) a revival of Neo-Confucianism led by thinkers such as Wang Yangming (1472-1529) became the predominant school of thought promoted by the imperial authorities.

Modern African thought studies a lot on Ethnophylosophy, by defining the meaning of African philosophy along with its unique characteristics and what it means to be African. During the 17th century, Ethiopian philosophy developed a strong literary tradition exemplified by Zera Yacob.

In Mesoamerica, Aztec philosophy was an intellectual tradition developed by individuals called Tlamatini ('those who know things') and whose ideas are preserved in various Aztec codices. The Aztec worldview put forward the concept of universal energy or universal power called Ometeotl which can be translated as \"Double Cosmic Energy\" and the search for ways to live in balance with a constantly changing \"crafty\" world. Teotl's theory can be seen as a form of Pantheism. Aztec philosophers developed the theory metaphysics, epistemology, values, and aesthetics. Aztec ethics was focused on seeking tlamatiliztli (knowledge, wisdom) based on moderation and balance in all actions as in the Nahua adage \"goodness in the middle is indispensable\".

(A philosopher might specialize in Kantian epistemology, platonic aesthetics, or modern political philosophy.) Also, these philosophical questions sometimes overlap with other questions such as science, religion or mathematics. Metaphysics is the study of the most general features of reality, such as existence, time, objects and their properties, the whole and its parts, events, processes and causes and effects, and the relationship between mind and body. Metaphysics includes cosmology, the study of the world as a whole and ontology, the study of reality. The main subject of debate is between realists, who argue that there are independent entities apart from their mental perceptions and idealism, who argue that reality is mentally or immaterially constructed. Metaphysics deals with the topic of identity. Essence is the set of attributes that make an object what it is and without essence the object loses its identity, while accidents are properties that belong to objects, without which the object can still retain its identity. Particulars are objects that are said to exist in space and time, as opposed to abstract objects, such as numbers, and universals, which are properties shared by some particular things, such as the reddish color of an object or its gender. The kind of existence (if any) of universal and abstract objects is a contentious issue in metaphysics. Epistemology is the study of knowledge (from the Greek episteme).

Value theory includes ethics, aesthetics, political philosophy, feminist philosophy, legal philosophy, and others. Ethics, or \"moral philosophy\", studies and considers good and bad behavior, right and wrong values, and good and evil. His main investigations include how to lead a good life and identifying moral standards. It also includes a meta-analysis of how best to live or related standards exist.

Aesthetics is \"a critical reflection of art, culture and nature.\" This branch of philosophy discusses the nature of art, beauty and taste, enjoyment, emotional values, perception and the creation and appreciation of beauty. Aesthetics, more precisely defined as the study of sensory matters or sensory-emotional values, is sometimes called the judgment of feelings and tastes.

Richard Feynman argued that the philosophy of a topic was irrelevant to his main research, saying that \"the philosophy of science is as useful to scientists as ornithology is to birds.\" Curtis White, on the other hand, argues that philosophical tools are essential to the humanities, science and social sciences. The topics of the philosophy of science are numbers, symbols and formal methods of reasoning as used in the social and natural sciences. Logic is the study of reasoning and argument. An argument is \"a series of connected statements intended to construct a proposition\". The series of connected statements is called the \"premise\" and the proposition is the conclusion. For example: Therefore, Socrates is mortal. (conclusion) Deductive reasoning is that when given certain premises, the conclusion is implied and inescapable. Inference rules are used to infer conclusions such as, modus ponens, where given \"A\" and \"If A then B\", then \"B\" must be inferred.

His personality, however, is based almost entirely on a small book which he ascribed to himself. Saddened by the tendency for people to benefit from the goodness he taught, and seeking greater personal peace as he advanced in age, Laozi finally rode a buffalo and headed west, to what is now Tibet (Hankao Valley). Before leaving, there was a gatekeeper who tried to stop him from leaving. Because his efforts failed, he asked Laozi to leave a note regarding Laozi's views. Then Laozi stayed for three days, and after that he returned with a small book containing \u00b1 5000 Chinese characters entitled Dao De Jing. Laozi is also said to have lived in the same era as Confucius. However, by examining Daode Jing's book, it can be concluded that this is impossible, because there are some ideas that are not likely to be widely known at the time of Confucius. Most modern scholars state that Laozi lived \u00b1 2 centuries after Confucius. The core teaching of Taoism is \"Dao\" (\u9053) which means formless, invisible, but is the process of occurrence of all living things and all things that exist in the universe. The Dao that exists in the form of living things and other things is De (\u5fb7). The combination of Dao and De is known as Taoism which is the foundation of nature. Taoism is calm, unrequited, gentle as water, and eternal. Human immortality is realized when one attains Dao consciousness, and that person becomes a god.

This power is the source of millions of objects in the world. Every object in the universe, whether animate or inanimate, contains Yinyang, which complement each other to achieve balance. In terminology, Yin and Yang are translated as negative and positive. Every object is dualism which consists of positive elements and negative elements. Objects that do not have negative and positive elements, it means empty and empty. Like magnets, magnets have positive and negative elements, both of which are complementary. Magnets without positive elements, negative elements do not materialize. That means that a magnet will not exist if it does not have these two elements. Later Taoism had a strong emphasis on human harmony with the Dao and the universe. The Dao is seen as transcending all things, both human and natural, and at the same time it is also spread within this realm. In Taoism it is said that humans must live according to the ways of nature (Dao), understand its essence, and live in harmony with it. The true Dao cannot be named, nor can it be described in words. The true Dao can only be understood through human spiritual awareness. However, in order to make it easier for people to understand this Dao, the Dao must be explained in words. Dao is literally a \"path\" or \"path\". In order to better understand this \"way\", there are three meanings that can be learned: 1. Tao is the Way of Ultimate Reality Dao cannot be grasped because it transcends the reach of the five senses.",

This first and fundamental meaning of the Dao can be known, only through a mystical awareness that cannot be explained in words. 2. Tao is the Way of the Universe Dao is transcendent but also immanent. The Dao is the driving force of this universe, that is, it is the rule, rhythm, and driving force of the entire universe, and it is also the governing principle that lies behind all that exists. Dao is a spirit that inhabits all nature, so it becomes a \"thing\" and is immanent. 3. Tao is the Way Humans Arrange Their Life Dao also gives instructions to humans regarding the life that humans should live so that it is in harmony with the way this universe works. This relates to other teachings and ethics of Taoism. The most popular Yin Yang symbol is the Xiantian Taiji (\u5148\u5929\u592a\u6975\u5716) or Yinyang Yu (\u9670\u967d\u9b5a) symbol introduced by Lai Zhide (\u4f86\u77e5\u5fb7; 1525~1604). The history of the study and development of the Yinyang symbol began during the Song dynasty until the 15th century. The other symbols of Taoism are Chentuan (\u9673\u6476) and Zhou Dunyi (\u5468\u6566\u9824), the popularity of these two symbols ranks after the popularity of the Xiantian Taiji symbol. The original symbol of Taoism was the coat of arms Wuji(\u7121\u6975\u5716) by Chentuan in the early Song Dynasty, later advanced by Chou Dunyi who introduced the symbol Taiji (\u592a\u6975\u5716). Wu-wei can literally be translated as 'not having activities' or 'not doing'.

        "paragraph": "Because wu-wei is the nature of life in harmony with the universe. Acting artificially and at will is contrary to natural attitudes or reasonable attitudes. According to the Wu-wei theory, one should limit one's activities to what is necessary and what is natural or natural. As in achieving a certain goal, don't overdo it or make any effort at will. In doing this deed, one should take moderation as the guiding principle of life, for human beings have too many desires and too much knowledge. They seek happiness by fulfilling their desires. However, when they try to fulfill too many desires, they get the opposite result. Wu-wei is life lived without tension. Wu-wei is the pure embodiment of gentleness, simplicity, and freedom; an effective, pure ability in which no movement is wasted just to show it off. If Wu-wei is seen from the outside, one can see that he is helpless, because he is never pushy and never looks tense. The secret here lies in the way it seeks out the empty spaces in life and nature and moves through these. Chuang Tzu explains this with his story of a butcher whose knife had not been dull for twenty years. When pressed to explain his secret, the butcher replied, \u201cFrom between the bones at every joint there is always a space. Otherwise, of course there would be no movement. By seeking out this space and passing through it my cleaver lays wide the bones without touching them.\u201d The natural phenomenon that is most similar to the Tao in the view of Taoists is water.

The last characteristic is its clarity when it is calm. However, clarity can only be caught by the mind's eye if human life reaches the still calm of a deep and still lake. According to the view of Taoism, human life has been outlined by 'sky'. Humans have their own way. What man has to do is only research that path and follow that trail without trying to impose his narrow views, and without the will to deviate from nature for personal gain. Such an attitude is called Wu Wei, which means not interfering. Wu-wei can also be interpreted as 'not willing'. Humans in the view of Taoism, must eliminate their desires, and follow the course of natural processes without interfering with those processes. According to Taoism, if humans become arrogant and do things beyond their capabilities, then one day he will be reproached which can make him grieve or suffer. Therefore, a sage who knows the Dao and the laws of nature would choose to resign and reject any honors bestowed upon him. He chose to keep a low profile. However, Taoism does not teach that one must get rid of all possessions to achieve inner peace. The thing that needs to be thrown away is the feeling of attachment to the treasure. If wealth is thrown away but there is still attachment to it, then it is in vain. Therefore, get rid of attachment to property from human beings, and property must be used for social purposes.

A good human being is one who is able to follow the course of the universe according to the Dao. If a human had successfully followed the path of the Dao, then he would not have to fear death. Death is a natural process and humans cannot fight nature, therefore humans do not need to be afraid or anxious about death. Death only returns man to the Dao. In living an existing life, humans lead to a natural life without any interfering process. This natural life becomes a basic virtue that triggers the emergence of three other virtues that guide humans in their life, namely meekness, humility, and self-denial. Meekness is a friend of life, on the other hand, hardness and rigidity are friends of death. Humility is the attitude of being able to limit oneself by doing only what is necessary. In the Daode Ching it says, \u201cThere is no greater curse than to be dissatisfied. There is no greater sin than always wanting to have.\u201d Then self-denial is an attitude of considering oneself and human life only as a loan from the universe to humans. Therefore, humans who are wise and want to live a quiet and peaceful life will entrust their entire lives to the Dao or the universe.

In general there are two major schools of Taoism. First is the Zhengyi \u6b63\u4e00\u6d3e tradition and the Quanzhen \u5168\u771f\u6d3e tradition. Also known as Fulu \u7b26\u7b93\u6d3e and Danding pai \u4e39\u9f0e\u6d3e. The characteristics of the Zhengyi sect are: First, all of Zhang Daoling's descendants become leaders. Since the 38th tianshi Zhang Yucai became \u201cZhengyi jiaozhu\u201d, this position was continued by the tianshi's descendants. Although the title of tianshi was abolished during the Ming and Qing dynasties, the name Zhengyi jiaozhu was also not a gift from the emperor, but for his people it was natural to continue to have Zhang Daoling's descendant as their leader. Second, from an organizational point of view, due to the merger, many origins came from various old and new Fulu sects. Including the Longhu, Maoshan, Gezao, Taiyi, Jingming sects, as well as the Shenxiao sect, Qingwei, Donghua, Tianxin and various other small sects. more relaxed.

For example, the sects of Longhu, Jingming, Qingwei and others , until now the inheritance is not interrupted. Third, the book that is respected and upheld together is the book \"Zhengyi jing\" \u6b63\u4e00\u7ecf, with the main knowledge being talisman, chanting mantras, qirang zaijiao.

        "paragraph": "Zen is one of the schools of Mahayana Buddhism. The word Zen is a Japanese origin from the Chinese \"Chan\" (\u79aa, Pinyin: Ch\u00e1n). The word \"Chan\" itself comes from the Pali \"jhana\" or the Sanskrit dhyana ( \u0927\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0928 ). In Vietnamese, Zen is known as \"thi\u1ec1n\" and in Korean, it is known as \"seon\". Jhana or Dhy\u0101na is a focused state of mind encountered in meditation. Although semantically, the word Chan itself comes from the word 'dhy\u0101na' (Sanskrit) or 'jhana' (Pali) or 'Chan-na' \u79aa\u90a3 (Chinese). Zen does not aim at attaining the jhanas. This simply shows that Zen teachings place great emphasis on the meditation or samadhi aspect. When it came to China from India, Buddhism was originally adapted to Chinese culture and understanding so that it was exposed to the influence of Confucianism and Taoism. Goddard quotes D.T. Suzuki by calling Ch\u00e1n a \"natural transformation of Buddhism in a Taoist environment\". Judging from the reception by Han Hinayana's work and from early comments, it appears that Buddhism was perceived and assimilated through religious Daoism (Taoism). Buddha was seen as a foreign immortal who had attained some form of Daoist immortal. Buddhists' careful breathing is considered an extension of the Daoist breathing practice. Taoist terminology was used to express Buddhist doctrines in the oldest translations of Buddhist texts, in a practice called ko-i, which means \"according to concepts\", when the newly emerging Chinese version of Buddhism had to compete with Taoism. and Confucianism. The first Buddhists recruited in China were Taoists. They developed a high appreciation for the newly introduced Buddhist meditation techniques, and combined them with Taoist meditation. Early members of the Chinese version of Buddhism such as Sengzhao and Tao Sheng were heavily influenced by the foundational works of the Taoist faith written by Laozi and Zhuangzi.",

        "paragraph": "Against this background, the concept of the nature of the Tao was inherited by the early disciples of Ch\u00e1n: they paralleled the ineffable nature of the Tao and Buddha to a certain extent. As such, they do not feel attached to the abstract \"wisdom of the sutras\" or the emphasized Buddha-nature that can be found in \"everyday\" human life, the same is true of the Tao. Zen school is considered to have originated from Bodhidharma. He is originally from India and is a student of the 28th generation after Mahakassapa (in Pali; Sanskrit: Mahakasyapa). Around 520 he went to South China in the Liang kingdom. He then meditated for 9 years facing a stone wall at the temple in Luoyang. It is also believed that the Shaolin temple (\u5c11\u6797\u5bfa) was founded here. The original Zen flow was then passed on to the 6th generation of Hui Neng. After that Zen flow spread in China, and Japan. Although the Zen narrative states that it is a \"special exposition outside the scriptures\" that is not composed of words, Zen does have a rich doctrinal background. The most important thing is that \"the most fundamental teaching is that we are enlightened from the start.\" \", and Bodhisattva idealism, which complements insight with Karun\u0101, compassion for all living beings. It is almost impossible to pinpoint \"which Zen teachings are important\", given the many different schools of thought, the history conveyed over 1500 years, and what emphasis on understanding reality, as it should be, should be expressed in everyday life, not in words. But common to most schools and teachings is the emphasis on understanding as it is, Bodhisattva idealism, and the priority of zazen. Zen's teachings can be likened to \u201cfinger pointing to the moon.\u201d Zen teachings point to the moon, awakening, \u201crealization of the interpenetration of dharmadha That's not happening soon.\"",

        "paragraph": "However, the Zen tradition also warns against its teachings, that the pointing finger is insight itself. Different traditions place different emphases in their teachings and practices: Central to Zen practice is dhyana or meditation. The Zen tradition holds that in the practice of meditation, understanding of doctrines and precepts necessitates the creation of various ideas and appearances (Skt. sa\u1e43j\u00f1\u0101; Ch. \u76f8, Xiang) that obscure the meaning of the wisdom of each attribute of a Buddhist being. This process of rediscovery is referred to by various terms such as \u201cintrospection\u201d, \u201cstep back\u201d, \u201cturnaround\u201d or \u201clooking deeper\u201d. During sitting meditation, practitioners usually assume positions such as the lotus, half-lotus, Burmese, or seiza postures, using dhy\u0101na mudr\u0101. To regulate the mind, awareness is directed by counting or observing the breath, or it is introduced into the energy center below the navel (see also anapanasati). Often, square or round pillows are placed on a soft mat and used for sitting. In some other cases, a chair may also be used. This practice may be called sitting dhyana, which is also called zuochan (\u5750\u7985) in Chinese, and zazen (\u5750\u7985) in Japanese. In the Soto Zen tradition, meditation without object, desire, or content is the main form of this meditation practice. The meditator tries to become aware of the flow of thoughts that allows them to arise and disappear without interruption. Considerable textual, philosophical, and phenomenological justifications for this practice can be found throughout the Dogen Sh\u014db\u014dgenz\u014d, such as in the books \"Principles of Zazen\" and \"Universally Recommended Instructions for Zazen\". In Japanese, this practice is called shikantaza.

Frequent periods of 30-50 minute meditation interspersed with short breaks, meals, and occasionally, short-term work should be done with the same mindfulness; night's sleep is kept to a minimum: 7 hours or less. In modern Buddhist practice in Japan, Taiwan, and the West, ordinary students often attend intense practice sessions, which are usually 1, 3, 5, or 7 days long. These practice sessions are held in many Zen centers, especially in the context of attaining the Buddha's Anuttar\u0101 Samyaksa\u1e43bodhi. One of the distinctive aspects of Zen meditation in groups is the use of flat wooden splinters used to keep meditators focused and awake. In Japanese, this practice is called sesshin. In the early Song dynasty, the practice of the ''k\u014dan'' method became popular, while others practiced \"silent illumination.\" This is the source of some of the differences between the Linji and Caodong traditions in practice. A k\u014dan, which literally means \"a common case\", is a story or dialogue describing the interaction between a Zen master and a student. This anecdote demonstrates the master's insight. emphasizes the non-conceptual insights conveyed by Buddhism. K\u014dan can be used to induce \"great doubts,\" and test a student's progress in Zen practice. Inquiry K\u014dan can be practiced during sitting meditation (zazen), walking meditation (kinhin), and all activities daily life. The practice of K\u014dan is especially emphasized by the Japanese Rinzai school, but this practice is also practiced by other schools or branches of Zen, depending on the way of teaching. The Zen student's mastery of the k\u014dan that has been given is presented to the teacher in a private interview (in Japanese it is called as dokusan (\u72ec\u53c2), daisan (\u4ee3\u53c2), or sanzen(\u53c2\u7985)).",

Interaction with a Zen master is important in Zen, but it makes Zen practice, at least in the West, susceptible to misunderstanding and exploitation. From the 12th and 13th centuries, a further development was Zen art, following the introduction of this genre by Dogen and Eisai after their return from China. Zen art is largely characterized by original painting (such as sumi-E and Enso) and poetry (especially haiku). This art strives to express the true essence of the world through impressionism and unadorned images that are not \"dualistic\". The search for \"momentary\" illumination also led to the development of other important derivative literature such as Chanoyu (tea ceremony) or Ikebana; the art of flower arrangement. This development goes as far as the opinion that every human activity is an artistic activity loaded with spiritual and aesthetic content, first of all if the activity is related to combat techniques (martial arts). Zen has greatly influenced the development of martial arts such as Kendo, Kyudo, Judo, Karate and Aikido. In ancient Japan, Zen had a great impact on Samurai warriors, and was widely adopted as their official religion. The samurai attained perfection in the martial art of Zazen practice. This practice was ideal for the Samurai way of life as it emphasized serenity, awareness, and willingness to face death. Even to a certain degree, Zen is called the religion of the Samurai. The great swordsman Miyamoto Musashi and several of the 47 Ronin were Zen masters.

He is the founder of Buddhism and is revered by Buddhists as a fully enlightened being who teaches the path to Nirvana (literally \"disappearance or extinction\"), freedom from ignorance, craving, rebirth and suffering. According to Buddhist tradition, the Buddha was born in Lumbini in what is now Nepal, to noble parents from the Shakya clan, but left his family to live as a wandering ascetic. Leading a life of begging, austerities, and meditation, he attained enlightenment in Bodh Gaya. The Buddha then traveled through the lower Ganges, teaching and establishing a monastic order. He taught the middle way between sensual indulgence and severe asceticism, a training of the mind that includes ethical training and meditative practices such as effort, mindfulness, and jhanas. He died in Kushinagar, attaining parinirvana. The Buddha has since been venerated by many faiths and communities throughout Asia. Several centuries after the Buddha's death, his teachings were compiled by the Buddhist community on the Vinaya, his code for monastic practice, and the Suttas, texts based on his sermons. It was passed down in a Central Indo-Aryan dialect through oral tradition. Later generations compiled additional texts, such as the systematic treatise known as the \"Abhidharma\", a biography of the Buddha, collections of stories about his past lives known as the Jataka tales, and additional discourses, namely the Mahayana sutras. Prince Siddhartha was born in 623 BC in Lumbini Park, when Queen Maha Maya stood holding a sal tree branch. At the moment he was born, two small currents fell from the sky, one cold while the other warm.",

The opposite of universal can be specific, it can also be discriminatory, and so on, depending on the context of the sentence that contains the word universal. The definition of 'universal' in mathematical concepts can be more accurately explained, even though it requires more perseverance for everyone to understand it. Even a mathematical concept per se (itself) is a universal concept. One of the easiest ways to understand the universal nature of a mathematical concept is by exemplifying what is usually considered the easiest mathematical concept, namely the concept of a number, especially the concept of a positive integer, namely the concept of natural numbers. Even though mathematicians around the world define only one concept as the set of all natural numbers 1, 2, 3, ..., and so on, miraculously every normal human being with a different mind turns out to be able to agree (universally) with only one concept. the original numbers. This fact is the basis for the argument that mathematical concepts are universal concepts. Note that the concept of the set of natural numbers includes the concept of order. Together with the concept of sequence, the concepts of greater and lesser are also defined. Consequently, in the set of all natural numbers, the number 1 is defined as the smallest number because in the concept of sequence, the number 1 is in the first position.

Education often takes place under the guidance of others, but is also possible on a self-taught basis. The etymology of the word education itself comes from the Latin word ducare, meaning \"to guide, direct, or lead\" and the prefix e, meaning \"to go out\". So, education means the activity of \"leading out\". Any experience that has a formative effect on the way people think, feel, or act can be considered educational. Education is generally divided into stages such as preschool, elementary school, junior high school, high school, and then college, university or apprenticeship. A right to education has been recognized by several governments. At the global level, Article 13 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights recognizes the right of everyone to education. Although education is compulsory in most places up to a certain age, attending school is often not practiced, and a minority of parents opt for home-schooling, e-learning or similar education for their children. Education usually begins when a baby is born and lasts a lifetime. Education could have started before the baby was born as many people do by playing music and reading to babies in the womb with the hope that he can teach their babies before birth.

Empirical analysis tends to support the theoretical prediction that poor countries should grow faster than rich countries because they can adopt technologies that are already tried and tested by rich countries. However, technology transfer requires knowledgeable managers and engineers who are able to operate new machines or production practices borrowed from leaders in order to close the gap through imitation. Therefore, a country's ability to learn from leaders is a function of \"human capital\" effects. Recent studies of the determinants of aggregate economic growth have emphasized the importance of fundamental economic institutions and the role of cognitive skills. At the individual level, there is a large body of literature, largely related to the work of Jacob Mincer, on how profit relates to education and other human capital.

Democritos developed the idea of \u200b\u200batoms so that it is Democritos' thought that is better known in the history of philosophy. Apart from being a philosopher, Demokritos is also known to master many skills. Unfortunately, none of Demokritos' works have been preserved. Democritus wrote on natural science, astronomy, mathematics, literature, epistemology and ethics. There are about 300 quotations about Democritus' thoughts in ancient sources. Most of these quotes contain about ethics. Demokritos was born in the city of Abdera, Northern Greece. He lived around 460 BC to 370 BC. He comes from a wealthy family. When he was young, he used his inheritance to travel to Egypt and other Eastern countries. Apart from being a student of Leucippus, he also studied with Anaxagoras and Philolaos. Little is known from the life of Democritus. Much data about his life has been mixed with legends whose truth is hard to believe. Even though he was a contemporary of Socrates, even younger, Democritos is still classified as a pre-socratic philosopher. This is because he continued and developed the teachings of atomism from Leukippos who was a pre-Socratic philosopher. The teachings of Leucippos and Demokritos are almost inseparable. Moreover, Democritus' philosophy was unknown in Athens for a long time. For example, Plato knew nothing about Atomism. Only Aristotle who then paid great attention to the view of atomism. Democritus and his teacher, Leucippos, argued that atoms are the elements that make up reality. Here, they agree with the pluralism of Empedocles and Anaxagoras that reality consists of many elements, not one. However, contrary to Empedocles and Anaxagoras, Democritus maintained that the elements could not be divided further.",

They are so small that the human eye cannot see them. In addition, atoms also lack qualities, such as hot or sweet. This is also what distinguishes it from the concept of Empedocles' substances and the seeds of Anaxagoras. The atoms differ from each other in three ways: their shape (as the letter A differs from the letter N), their order (as AN differs from NA), and their position (as the letter A differs from Z in alphabetical order). Thus, atoms have mere quantity, including mass. The number of atoms that make up this reality is infinite. In addition, atoms are also seen as uncreated, indestructible, and unchangeable. What happens to the atom is motion. Because of this, Democritus stated that \"the basic principles of the universe are atoms and emptiness\". If there is free space, then the atoms can move. Democritus compared the motion of atoms to the situation when sunlight enters a pitch-dark room through the cracks of a window. There you will see how the dust moves in all directions, even though there is no wind to cause it to move. Thus, no other principle is needed to make the atoms move, such as the principle of \"love\" and \"hate\" according to Empedocles. The presence of empty space is enough to make the atoms move. The world and all reality is created because atoms of different shapes are related to each other. The associated atoms then begin to move around, and more and more atoms are taking part in the motion.

These atoms are moved by small images of an object called an idol. Thus sensory impressions arise on these objects. Previously it was said that every object, which is composed of atoms, gives off small images called eidolas. These images enter the human senses and are channeled to the soul. Humans can see because these tiny images come into contact with soul atoms. This kind of process applies to all other types of sensory recognition. Then what about the qualities that are perceived by the human senses, such as bitter, sweet, color, and so on? According to Demokritos these atoms have no qualities, so where do humans perceive these qualities? According to Democritus, such qualities result from the contact of certain atoms with others. For example, humans taste sweetness because soul atoms come into contact with slippery atoms. Then humans taste bitter when the soul comes into contact with coarse atoms. The feeling of heat is obtained because the soul comes into contact with atoms that move at high speed. Thus, Demokritos concluded that these qualities are only felt by the subject and not the actual state of things. For this reason, Demokritos stated that humans cannot recognize the true nature of things. What can be observed is only the symptoms or appearance of the object. Demokritos said: According to Demokritos, the highest value in human life is a perfect state of mind (euthymia). This can be achieved if humans balance all factors in life: pleasure and pain, pleasure and abstinence. The task of maintaining this balance is the ratio.

The necessity and authenticity of the causal system are part of the human sciences which are known together and are not covered by any doubt. Causality is established by the relationship between an event (cause) and a second event (effect or effect), in which the second event is understood as a consequence of the first. Causality is a basic assumption of science. In the scientific method, scientists design experiments to determine causality from real life. Embedded in the scientific method are hypotheses about causal relationships. The goal of the scientific method is to test these hypotheses. Causal reasoning is one of the most central competencies that allows us to adapt in the world. Knowledge of causality makes it possible to make predictions about the future or diagnose the cause of something. Planning and solving problems is done using knowledge from cause-and-effect relationships. Causal logic underpins computational logic, both inductive and deductive. Causality feeds into linear networks, often using theoretical and quantified relationship measurements with numbers. Causality is also related to the order of facts or events in reality. In contrast to empiricists who believe that events that occur after other events cannot be said to have a law of causality. Causal reasoning is inductive reasoning when some effects are inferred from what are considered as causes or some causes are inferred from what are considered as effects.

For example, oxygen is a necessary cause for combustion to occur. Combustion cannot occur in the absence of oxygen. While a sufficient cause (sufficient condition) is a condition that is certain to occur in an event. For example, the presence of oxygen is an absolute cause of combustion, but not a sufficient cause for combustion to occur because obviously oxygen can exist without combustion occurring. However, there are degrees of temperature in which the presence of oxygen causes combustion. In addition there are certain circumstances, because it is used in another sense, namely events or actions which, in the presence of conditions that usually exist, cause or not the occurrence of certain events. In this third sense, there is a remote cause, an event that is far from the effect being sought for explanation and a proximate cause, the event closest to the event being sought for explanation. For example, the insurance company sends investigators to find out the cause of the fire, the action of the insurance policy holder starting the fire is the direct cause, while the remote cause may be the crop failure he experienced. Causal relationships are understood as subject to certain conditions, so it makes sense to ask how A can be prevented from causing B, how someone allows A to cause B, or how the relationship between A and B can be intervened. Any assertion that a certain state is the cause of a certain phenomenon implies the existence of some causal law. The law of causation is a descriptive law that asserts a necessary relationship between two types of events, one of which is the cause and the other the effect. Two types of causal relations have been distinguished explicitly, namely the law of causality and causal instances.",

There is something odd about the idea of \u200b\u200bcausation being more empirical than logical. Of course not every true causal statement is empirical. Suppose 'A causes B' is true. Then the cause of B = A; so analytically if substituted, the cause of B causes B. The truth of the causal statement depends on what event is being described. However, it can be maintained that reasons rationalize an action only when the description has been properly fixed. David Hume criticizes the law of causality which explains that there is a second essence after which it is the impact or necessity of the first essence. According to him, causality occurs because of a stagnant ordering process. David Hume argues that causal relationships are very important and a priori does not deny that all changes have a cause and are important for science, but the idea of \u200b\u200ba cause and effect relationship is not found in the object being observed, but only in subjectivity. For example, fire and burning sensation in the fingers. After experiencing A followed by B repeatedly with a combination of ideas, it can be seen that B occurs after A. And even though it is forced, there is a feeling of urge to expect B to occur. The causal relationship is not an objective relationship between objects and is more an inter-subjective impulse. The objects are not related nor do they originate from any principle except the subject's habit of drawing conclusions. The mistake that often occurs in causality reasoning is post hoc propter hoc meaning this happens after it happens then this is a result of that. In other words, it is an error to admit that an event occurred sequentially, so that the second event is the result of the first event.",

Although most cells in the body, such as the heart or liver, have been specially formed to fulfill a particular function, stem cells remain in an undifferentiated state until certain signals direct them to differentiate into a particular type of cell. Its ability to proliferate together with its ability to differentiate into a particular cell type is what makes it unique. Biological characteristics and stem cell differentiation focus on mesenchymal stem cells. Applications of stem cells include the treatment of heart infarctions, namely using stem cells derived from bone marrow to replace damaged vessel cells (neovascularization).",

Further discussion of aesthetics is a philosophy that studies sensory values \u200b\u200bwhich are sometimes considered as judgments of sentiment and taste. Aesthetics is a branch that is very close to the philosophy of art. Aesthetics comes from the Greek \u03b1\u1f30\u03c3\u03b8\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 (aisthetikos, meaning \"beauty, sensitivity, awareness, related to sensory perception\"), which is a derivative of \u03b1\u1f30\u03c3\u03b8\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9 (aisthanomai, meaning \"I see, feel, feel\"). First used by the philosopher Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten in 1735 for the notion of the science of things that can be felt through feelings. Even though initially something beautiful is judged from a technical aspect in forming a work, changes in the mindset of society will also influence the assessment of beauty. For example, at the time of romanticism in France, beauty meant the ability to present a majesty. In the era of realism, beauty meant the ability to present something as it is. At the time of de Stijl's rise in the Netherlands, beauty meant the ability to combine color and space and the ability to abstract objects. Further developments made him realize that beauty does not always have a certain formula. It develops according to the public's acceptance of the ideas raised by the creator of the work. That's why there are always two things known in the assessment of beauty, namely the beauty, a work that is recognized by many parties to meet the standards of beauty, and the ugly, a work that does not meet the standards of beauty at all and is considered by many people to be bad, but when viewed from many things turn out to show beauty. Beauty should have been judged when works of art were first created, but the definition of beauty was first documented by the philosopher Plato who determined beauty from proportion, harmony, and unity.",

This temple is located approximately 100 km southwest of Semarang, 86 km west of Surakarta, and 40 km northwest of Yogyakarta. This temple with many stupas was founded by adherents of Mahayana Buddhism around the year 800 AD during the reign of the Syailendra dynasty. Borobudur is the largest Buddhist temple or shrine in the world, as well as one of the largest Buddhist monuments in the world. This monument consists of six square terraces on which there are three circular courtyards, the walls are decorated with 2,672 relief panels and originally there were 504 Buddha statues. Borobudur has the most complete and largest collection of Buddhist reliefs in the world. The largest main stupa is located in the center and crowns this building, surrounded by three circular rows of 72 perforated stupas in which there is a Buddha statue sitting cross-legged in a perfect lotus position with the Dharmachakra mudra (turning the wheel of dharma). This monument is a model of the universe and was built as a holy place to glorify Buddha as well as to function as a place of pilgrimage to guide mankind from the world of worldly desires to enlightenment and wisdom according to Buddhist teachings. Pilgrims enter via the east side and start the ritual at the base of the temple by walking around this sacred building in a clockwise direction, while continuing to ascend to the next steps through three levels of realms in Buddhist cosmology. The three levels are K\u0101madh\u0101tu (the realm of lust), Rupadhatu (the realm of form), and Arupadhatu (the realm of intangibility). On their way the pilgrims walk through a series of aisles and stairs to witness no less than 1,460 beautiful relief panels engraved on the walls and balustrades.",

The world began to realize the existence of this building since it was discovered in 1814 by Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles, who at that time served as the British Governor General over Java. Since then Borobudur has undergone a series of rescue and restoration efforts. The largest restoration project was carried out from 1975 to 1982 under the efforts of the Government of the Republic of Indonesia and UNESCO, then this historic site was included in the list of World Heritage Sites. Borobudur is still used today as a place of religious pilgrimage; every year Buddhists who come from all over Indonesia and abroad gather at Borobudur to commemorate the Vesak Trisuci. Regarding tourism, Borobudur is the single tourist attraction in Indonesia that is visited by the most tourists. On February 11, 2022, the government formalized the status of Borobudur Temple again as a place of worship for Buddhists in Indonesia and the world. In Indonesian, ancient religious buildings are called temples; temple term is also used more broadly to refer to all the ancient buildings originating from the Hindu-Buddhist in the archipelago, such as gates , gate , and petirtaan (swimming baths and showers). The origin of the name Borobudur is unclear, although the original names of most temples in Indonesia are unknown. The name Borobudur was first written in the book \"History of the Island of Java\" by Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles. Raffles wrote about a monument called Borobudur, but there are no older documents that mention the exact same name. The only ancient Javanese text that gives clues about the existence of a sacred Buddhist building that may refer to Borobudur is Nagarakretagama, written by Mpu Prapanca in 1365.",

Raffles also suspects that the term 'Budur' may be related to the Javanese term Buda which means \"ancient\"\u2013 hence, \"ancient Boro\". However, other archaeologists think that the name Budur comes from the term bhudhara which means mountain. Many theories attempt to explain the name of this temple. One of them states that this name probably comes from the word Sambharabhudhara, which means \"mountain\" (bhudara) where terraces are located on the slopes. In addition there are several other folk etymologies. For example, the word borobudur comes from the saying \"Buddhas\" which due to a shift in sound becomes borobudur. Another explanation is that this name comes from the two words \"coal\" and \"beduhur\". The word bara is said to have come from the word vihara, while there are also other explanations where bara comes from Sanskrit which means temple or monastery complex and beduhur which means \"high\", or reminiscent of Balinese which means \"above\". So the point is a monastery or hostel on high ground. Historian J.G. de Casparis in his doctoral dissertation in 1950 argued that Borobudur was a place of worship. Based on the Karangtengah and Tri Tepusan inscriptions, Casparis estimates that the founder of Borobudur was a Mataram king from the Syailendra dynasty named Samaratungga, who undertook construction around 824 AD. The giant building was only completed during the time of his daughter, Ratu Pramudawardhani. The construction of Borobudur is estimated to take half a century. In the Karangtengah inscription it is also mentioned about the awarding of sima land (tax free land) by \u00c7r\u012b Kahulunan (Pramudawardhani) to look after Kam\u016bl\u0101n called Bh\u016bmisambh\u0101ra.",

Located about 40 kilometers (25 mi) northwest of Yogyakarta City, Borobudur sits atop a hill in a plain surrounded by two pairs of twin mountains; Mount Sindoro-Sumbing in the northwest and Merbabu-Merapi in the northeast, to the north there is the Tidar Hill, closer to the south there are the Menoreh hills, and this temple is located near the confluence of two rivers namely the Progo River and the Elo River on the east. According to Javanese legend, the area known as the Kedu Plain is a place considered sacred in Javanese beliefs and venerated as the 'Garden of the island of Java' because of its natural beauty and soil fertility. Besides Borobudur, there are several Buddhist and Hindu temples in this area. During the discovery and restoration at the beginning of the 20th century, other Buddhist temples were found, namely Mendut Temple and Pawon Temple, which stretched in a straight line. At first it was suspected that it was just a coincidence, but based on the tales of local residents, there used to be a stone-lined road that was fenced off by a balustrade on both sides that connected these three temples. There was no physical evidence of the existence of a stone-paved and fenced highway and maybe this is just a myth, but experts suspect that there is indeed a unity of symbols from these three temples. These three temples (Borobudur-Pawon-Mendut) have similar architectural styles and decorations and indeed come from the same period which strengthens the suspicion that there is a ritual connection between these three temples.",

Archaeological findings around Borobudur are now stored in the Karmawibhangga Borobudur Museum, which is located to the north of the temple next to the Samudra Raksa Museum. Not how far north of Pawon Temple were found the ruins of a Hindu temple called Candi Banon. In this temple, several statues of the main Hindu gods were found in fairly good condition, namely Shiva, Vishnu, Brahma, and Ganesha. However, the original stone of Banon Temple was found so little that it was impossible to carry out a reconstruction. At the time of their discovery, the Banon statues were transported to Batavia (now Jakarta) and are now kept in the Indonesian National Museum. Unlike other temples which are built on flat land, Borobudur is built on a hill with a height of 265 m (869 ft) above sea level and 15 m (49 ft) above the bottom of an ancient lake that has dried up. The existence of this ancient lake became a matter of heated debate among archaeologists in the 20th century; and raises suspicions that Borobudur was built on the edge or even in the middle of the lake. In 1931, an artist and expert on Hindu Buddhist architecture, W.O.J. Nieuwenkamp, \u200b\u200bput forward the theory that the Kedu Plain was once a lake, and Borobudur was built to symbolize the lotus flower floating on the surface of the lake.

The three circular courtyards at the top of Borobudur are also thought to symbolize the lotus petals. However, Nieuwenkamp's theory, which sounds extraordinary and fantastic, has drawn much objection from archaeologists. On the land around this monument, archaeological evidence has been found which proves that the area around Borobudur at the time of the construction of this temple was dry land, not the bottom of an ancient lake. Meanwhile geologists actually support Nieuwenkamp's view by showing evidence of silt sediment deposits near this site. A study of stratigraphy, sediments and analysis of pollen samples carried out in 2000 supports the existence of an ancient lake in the vicinity of Borobudur, which strengthens Nieuwenkamp's ideas. The level of the surface of this ancient lake fluctuated over time, and evidence indicates that the bottom of a hill near Borobudur was once again submerged and became the bank of the lake sometime in the 13th and 14th centuries. River flows and volcanic activity are thought to have contributed to changing the landscape and topography of the environment around Borobudur including the lake. One of the most active volcanoes in Indonesia is Mount Merapi which is located quite close to Borobudur and has been active since the Pleistocene. There is no written evidence explaining who built Borobudur and what it was used for.

The construction of Borobudur is estimated to have taken more than 75-100 years and was actually completed during the reign of King Samaratungga in 825. There is confusion over the facts as to whether the king who ruled in Java at that time was Hindu or Buddhist. The Sailendra dynasty is known to be a devout adherent of Mahayana Buddhism, however, the findings of Sojomerto inscriptions show that they may have originally been Shiva Hindus. It was during this period that various Hindu and Buddhist temples were built on the Kedu Plain. Based on the Canggal Inscription, in 732 AD, the religious king Shiva Sanjaya ordered the construction of the sacred Shiwalingga building which was built on the hills of Mount Wukir, located only 10 km (6.2 mi) east of Borobudur. The Borobudur Buddhist temple was built at almost the same time as the temples on the Prambanan Plain, however, Borobudur is estimated to have been completed around 825 AD, twenty-five years earlier before the construction of the Shiva Prambanan temple began around 850 AD. The construction of Buddhist temples \u2014 including Borobudur \u2014 at that time it was possible because Sanjaya's heir, Rakai Panangkaran gave permission for Buddhists to build the temple.

Borobudur was hidden and neglected for centuries, buried under layers of soil and volcanic ash which then grew trees and shrubs so that Borobudur at that time really resembled a hill. The real reason why Borobudur was abandoned is still unknown. It is not known exactly when this sacred building ceased to be a center for Buddhist pilgrimage. Sometime between 928 and 1006, King Mpu Sindok moved the capital of the Medang Kingdom to the region of East Java after a series of volcanic eruptions; it is not certain whether this factor caused Borobudur to be abandoned, but some sources suspect that it is very possible that Borobudur began to be abandoned in this period.

Although there are many warning signs not to touch anything, warnings are sounded through loudspeakers and there are guards, vandalism in the form of vandalism and graffiti on reliefs and statues often occurs, this is clearly damaging this site. As of 2009, there is no system to limit the number of tourists who may visit per day, or apply that each visit must be accompanied by a guide so that visitors are always under supervision. On 11 February 2022, the government formalized the status of Borobudur Temple (together with Pawon and Mendut Temples) again as a place of worship for Buddhists in Indonesia and the world. Apart from Borobudur Temple, Prambanan Temple was also inaugurated as a place of worship for Hindus. The return of this status was declared through a memorandum of understanding agreed between the Regional Government of Yogyakarta, Central Java Provincial Government, Ministry of Religion, Ministry of Education, Culture, Research and Technology, Ministry of BUMN, Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy. This memorandum of understanding aims to restore the function of the four temples as places of worship, after previously they were more objects of research, tourism and cultural heritage. Borobudur was heavily affected by the eruptions of Mount Merapi in October and November 2010. Volcanic ash from Merapi covered the temple complex which is 28 kilometers (17 mi) west-southwest of the Merapi crater.",

The temple complex was closed from 5 to 9 November 2010 to clean up the loose dust. Observing the rehabilitation efforts of Borobudur after the 2010 Merapi eruption, UNESCO has donated US$3 million to fund the rehabilitation efforts. Cleaning the temple from volcanic ash deposits will take at least 6 months, followed by reforestation and tree planting in the surrounding area to stabilize the temperature, and finally reviving the social and economic life of the local community. More than 55,000 stone blocks of the temple must be dismantled to improve the water system. and drainage clogged with a mixture of volcanic ash mixed with rainwater. The restoration ended in November 2011, earlier than expected. Borobudur is a masterpiece of Indonesian Buddhist art, as an example of the pinnacle of achieving the harmony of architectural techniques and the aesthetics of Buddhist art in Java. The building is inspired by dharma ideas from India, including stupas and mandalas, but is believed to also be a continuation of local elements; megalithic structures punden terraces or terraced pyramids found from the prehistoric period of Indonesia. As a combination of native Indonesian ancestor worship and the struggle to reach Nirvana in Buddhism. In essence, Borobudur is a stupa which, when viewed from above, forms a large Mandala pattern. Mandalas are intricate patterns composed of squares and concentric circles that symbolize the cosmos or universe which are commonly found in Vajrayana-Mahayana Buddhists. The ten courtyards owned by Borobudur clearly illustrate the philosophy of the Mahayana school which simultaneously describes cosmology, namely the concept of the universe, as well as the levels of the mind in Buddhism.",

On this relief panel there are carved characters which are instructions for the sculptor to create scenes in relief images. This original foot is covered by the addition of a stone structure that forms a fairly large courtyard, its true function is still a mystery. Initially it was suspected that the addition of these legs was to prevent the monument from sliding. Another theory proposes that the addition of the legs is due to an error in the design of the original legs, and is not in accordance with Wastu Sastra, an Indian book on architecture and urban planning. Whatever the reason for the addition of these legs, the addition and manufacture of these additional legs is done carefully by considering religious, aesthetic and technical reasons. The three levels of the spiritual realm in Buddhist cosmology are: The highest level which describes the absence of a perfect form is symbolized by the largest and highest stupa. The stupa is described as plain without any holes. citation needed] Inside this largest stupa, an imperfect Buddha statue or also called an incomplete Buddha was found, which was mistaken for an 'Adibuddha' statue, even though through further research there was never a statue inside. the main stupa, the unfinished statue was the fault of the ancient sculptor.

This stone is cut to a certain size, transported to the site and put together without using cement. The structure of Borobudur does not use cement at all, but rather an interlock system, which is like lego blocks that can be attached without adhesive. The stones are put together with precise bumps and holes and fit one another, as well as a \"dove tail\" shape that interlocks the two stone blocks. The relief is made on site after the building structure and walls are completed. This monument is equipped with a drainage system that is good enough for areas with high rainfall. To prevent inundation and flooding, 100 fountains were installed in every corner, each with a unique design in the form of a giant head of kala or makara. reference] Borobudur is very different from the design of other temples, this temple is not built on a flat surface, but on a hill experience. However, the construction technique is similar to other temples in Java. Borobudur does not have worship spaces like other temples. That there are long hallways which is a narrow road. The hallways surrounding the walled temple level by level. In general, the design of Borobudur is similar to a stepped pyramid. It is in these alleys that Buddhists are thought to walk around the temple to the right. Borobudur may initially serve more as a stupa, rather than a temple or temple.

The shape of the building without rooms and terraced terraces is thought to be a development of the punden form, which is an original architectural form from prehistoric Indonesia. According to local legend the architect who designed Borobudur named Gunadharma, little is known about this mysterious architect. Its name is based more on Javanese tales and legends and not based on historical inscriptions. The legend of Gunadharma is related to folklore about the Menoreh hills which resemble the body of a lying down. This local legend tells that Gunadharma's lying body turned into the Menoreh hills, of course this legend is just fiction and fairy tales. The design of Borobudur uses a tuning measuring unit, namely the length of the human face between the tip of the hairline on the forehead to the tip of the chin, or the span between the tip of the thumb and the tip of the little finger when the palm is fully extended. Of course this unit is relative and slightly different between individuals, but this unit remains in this monument. Research in 1977 revealed a ratio of 4:6:9 found in this monument. The architect used this formula to determine the exact dimensions of a self-similar repeating geometry fractal in the Borobudur design. This mathematical ratio is also found in the design of the nearby Mendut and Pawon temples. Archaeologists believe that the 4:6:9 ratio and the unit of tuning have calendar, astronomical and cosmological functions and meanings. The same is true of the Angkor Wat temple in Cambodia. Building structures can be divided into three parts: the base (feet), the body, and the apex. The base measures 123\u00d7123 m (403.5 \u00d7 403.5 ft) and 4 meters (13 ft) high.",

Wu-wei can literally be translated as 'not having activities' or 'not doing'. This term actually does not mean that there is absolutely no activity or does nothing at all, but rather that it means acting without contrivance and not arbitrarily.",

According to the Wu-wei theory, one should limit one's activities to what is necessary and what is natural or natural. As in achieving a certain goal, don't overdo it or make any effort at will. In doing this deed, one should take moderation as the guiding principle of life, for human beings have too many desires and too much knowledge. They seek happiness by fulfilling their desires. However, when they try to fulfill too many desires, they get the opposite result. Wu-wei is life lived without tension. Wu-wei is the pure embodiment of gentleness, simplicity, and freedom; an effective, pure ability in which no movement is wasted just to show it off. If Wu-wei is seen from the outside, one can see that he is helpless, because he is never pushy and never looks tense. The secret here lies in the way it seeks out the empty spaces in life and nature and moves through these. Chuang Tzu explains this with his story of a butcher whose knife had not been dull for twenty years. When pressed to explain his secret, the butcher replied, \u201cFrom between the bones at every joint there is always a space. Otherwise, of course there would be no movement. By seeking out this space and passing through it my cleaver lays wide the bones without touching them.\u201d The natural phenomenon that is most similar to the Tao in the view of Taoists is water.

The last characteristic is its clarity when it is calm. However, clarity can only be caught by the mind's eye if human life reaches the still calm of a deep and still lake. According to the view of Taoism, human life has been outlined by 'sky'. Humans have their own way. What man has to do is only research that path and follow that trail without trying to impose his narrow views, and without the will to deviate from nature for personal gain. Such an attitude is called Wu Wei, which means not interfering. Wu-wei can also be interpreted as 'not willing'. Humans in the view of Taoism, must eliminate their desires, and follow the course of natural processes without interfering with those processes. According to Taoism, if humans become arrogant and do things beyond their capabilities, then one day he will be reproached which can make him grieve or suffer. Therefore, a sage who knows the Dao and the laws of nature would choose to resign and reject any honors bestowed upon him. He chose to keep a low profile. However, Taoism does not teach that one must get rid of all possessions to achieve inner peace. The thing that needs to be thrown away is the feeling of attachment to the treasure. If wealth is thrown away but there is still attachment to it, then it is in vain. Therefore, get rid of attachment to property from human beings, and property must be used for social purposes.

A good human being is one who is able to follow the course of the universe according to the Dao. If a human had successfully followed the path of the Dao, then he would not have to fear death. Death is a natural process and humans cannot fight nature, therefore humans do not need to be afraid or anxious about death. Death only returns man to the Dao. In living an existing life, humans lead to a natural life without any interfering process. This natural life becomes a basic virtue that triggers the emergence of three other virtues that guide humans in their life, namely meekness, humility, and self-denial. Meekness is a friend of life, on the other hand, hardness and rigidity are friends of death. Humility is the attitude of being able to limit oneself by doing only what is necessary. In the Daode Ching it says, \u201cThere is no greater curse than to be dissatisfied. There is no greater sin than always wanting to have.\u201d Then self-denial is an attitude of considering oneself and human life only as a loan from the universe to humans. Therefore, humans who are wise and want to live a quiet and peaceful life will entrust their entire lives to the Dao or the universe.

Although the title of tianshi was abolished during the Ming and Qing dynasties, the name Zhengyi jiaozhu was also not a gift from the emperor, but for his people it was natural to continue to have Zhang Daoling's descendant as their leader. Second, from an organizational point of view, due to the merger, many origins came from various old and new Fulu sects.

According to Muhammad Mustafa, the scope of discussion in criminology can be divided into: The basics of criminological theory, namely: It is an initial thought that was developed on the basis of irrational thinking, where a criminal behavior committed by an individual is the influence of an evil spirit (demon = Devil). Right or wrong behavior is determined by the definition of the chief or person who is considered a god. This thinking is still conventional where the most serious violation for Demonologists is to use black magic or known as black magic. The punishments used are also still traditional in nature which are aimed at expelling evil spirits within the individual, such as burning individuals who have black magic. In the explanation of classical thought, evil behavior by humans is a reflection of the concept of \"free will\". In an explanation of classical thinking with the concept of free will, it assumes that individuals have choices and thoughts to determine the actions they will take.

This science basically studies the various aspects of celestial objects such as their origin, physical/chemical properties, meteorology, and motion as well as how knowledge of these objects explains the formation and development of the universe. Astronomy as a science is one of the oldest, as it is known from astronomical artifacts dating back to the prehistoric era; for example the monuments from Egypt and Nubia, or Stonehenge which is from Britain. People from early civilizations such as Babylon, Ancient Greece, China, India and the Maya were also found to have made methodological observations of the night sky. Despite having a long history, astronomy was only able to develop into a modern branch of science through the invention of the telescope. Quite a number of branches of science have been included as part of astronomy, and when one pays attention, the nature of these branches is very diverse: from astrometry, space-based navigation, observational astronomy, to calendar compilation and astrology. However, today professional astronomy is considered synonymous with astrophysics. In the 20th century, professional astronomy was divided into two branches, namely observational astronomy; Astronomical studies that involve collecting data from observations of celestial bodies, which will then be analyzed using the basic principles of physics and theoretical astronomy; The study of astronomy that focuses on efforts to develop computer/analytical models to explain the properties of celestial bodies and other natural phenomena.

When referring to the KBBI definition, \"astronomy\" is the science of \"the sun, moon, stars and other planets\" while \"astrophysics\" is a branch of astronomy that studies \"the behavior, physical properties, and dynamics of celestial objects and phenomena.\" In certain cases, for example at the opening of the book The Physical Universe by Frank Shu, \"astronomy\" may be used for the qualitative side of this science, while \"astrophysics\" for the other side which is more physics oriented. However, most modern astronomical studies deal with topics related to physics, so that it can be considered that modern astronomy is astrophysics. Many research bodies, in deciding which term to use, depend solely on whether or not they were historically affiliated with physics departments. Many professional astronomers themselves have degrees in physics. To further illustrate, one of the leading scientific journals in this branch of science is called Astronomy and Astrophysics. At first, astronomy only involved observations and predictions of the movements of celestial bodies visible to the naked eye. At sites such as Stonehenge, early civilizations also compiled artifacts that were thought to have had astronomical uses.

Generally, early astronomy was preoccupied with mapping the positions of stars and planets (now called astrometry), activities which eventually gave birth to theories about the movement of celestial bodies and philosophical thoughts to explain the origin of the Sun, Moon and Earth. Earth was then considered to be the center of the universe, while the Sun, Moon and stars revolved around it; such a model is known as the geocentric model, or the Ptolemaic system (after the Roman-Egyptian astronomer Ptolemy). The start of astronomy based on mathematical and scientific calculations was pioneered by the Babylonians. They found that lunar eclipses have a regular cycle, called the cycle of saros. Following in the footsteps of the Babylonian astronomers, progress after progress was then made by the astronomical community of Ancient Greece and the surrounding countries. Greek astronomy from the very beginning had the goal of finding a rational, physics-based explanation for celestial phenomena. In the 3rd century BC, Aristarchus of Samos calculated the size of the Earth and the distance between the Earth and the Moon, and then proposed a heliocentric model of the Solar System \u2014 the first in history. In the 2nd century BC, Hipparchus discovered the motion of precession, also calculated the sizes of the Moon and Sun and the distance between them, as well as making the earliest astronomical research tools such as the astrolabe. The majority of constellations in the Northern Hemisphere today are still based on the arrangement formulated by him through a catalog that at that time included 1,020 stars. The famous Antikythera mechanism (ca. 150-80 BC) also dates from the same period: the analog computer used to calculate the positions of the Sun/Moon/planets on certain dates was the most complex item in history until the 14th century, when astronomical clocks began to appear in Europe.",

On the other hand, rapid developments occurred in the Islamic world and several other civilizations, marked by the construction of observatories in other parts of the world in the early 9th century. In 964, the Persian astronomer Al-Sufi discovered the Andromeda Galaxy (the largest galaxy in the Local Group) and recorded it in the Book of Fixed Stars (Kitab Suwar al-Kawakib). Supernova SN 1006, the brightest exploding star in recorded history, was observed by the Egyptian astronomer Ali bin Ridwan and a separate group of Chinese astronomers in the same year (1006 AD). The great astronomers of the Islamic era were mostly Persian and Arabic, including Al-Battani, Thabit bin Qurrah, Al-Sufi, Ibn Balkhi, Al-Biruni, Al-Zarqali, Al-Birjandi, as well as astronomers from the observatory- observatories in Maragha and Samarkand. It was through this era that Arabic-based star names were introduced. The ruins in Greater Zimbabwe and Timbuktu may also have had observatory buildings undermining previous beliefs that there were no astronomical observations in the sub-Saharan region before the colonial era. During the Renaissance, Copernicus devised the heliocentric model of the Solar System, a model which was later defended in controversy, developed, and corrected by Galileo and Kepler. Galileo innovated with a telescope to improve astronomical observations, while Kepler succeeded in becoming the first scientist to accurately and detailedly compile the movements of the planets with the Sun as their center. However, he failed to formulate a theory to explain the laws he wrote, until finally Newton (who also invented the reflector telescope for sky observation) explained them through space dynamics and the law of gravity. As telescopes got better in size and quality, more and more further discoveries were made. Through this technology, de Lacaille was able to develop more complete star catalogs; a similar endeavor was made by the German-British astronomer William Herschel with the production of catalogs of nebulae and clusters.",

The 18th to 19th centuries were first marked by research on the three-body problem by Euler, Clairaut, and D'Alembert; research that resulted in more precise prediction methods for the movements of the Moon and planets. This work was refined by Lagrange and Laplace, enabling scientists to estimate the masses of planets and satellites by perturbation. The invention of the spectroscope and photography later led to further research advances: in 1814-1815, Fraunhoffer discovered approximately 600 spectral bands on the Sun, and in 1859 Kirchhoff was finally able to explain this phenomenon by attributing it to the existence of elements. At this time the stars were confirmed to be other, more distant suns, but with differences in temperature, mass, and size. It wasn't until the 20th century that the Milky Way Galaxy (where the Earth and Sun are located) was proven to be a separate star group from other star groups. From these same observations it was concluded that there are other galaxies beyond the Milky Way and that the universe is continuing to expand, because these galaxies are moving away from our own. Modern astronomy has also discovered and attempted to explain strange celestial bodies such as quasars, pulsars, blazars, radio galaxies, black holes and neutron stars. Physical cosmology advanced rapidly during this century: the Big Bang model, for example, has been supported by strong astronomical and physical evidence (CMB radiation, Hubble's law, and the cosmological availability of elements, among others).

Further details about these divisions can be seen below: This type of observational astronomy observes radiation with a wavelength greater than one millimeter (approx.). Unlike the other types, radio-type observational astronomy observes waves that can be treated as waves, not discrete photons. Thus the measurement of phase and amplitude is relatively easier when compared to shorter waves. Radio waves can be generated by astronomical bodies by means of thermal emission, but most of the radio emission observed from Earth is in the form of synchrotron radiation, which is produced when electrons orbit around a magnetic field. A number of spectral lines resulting from interstellar gas (eg the spectral lines of hydrogen at 21 cm) are also observable at radio wavelengths. Some examples of objects that radio astronomy can observe: supernovas, interstellar gas, pulsars, and active galactive nuclei (AGN). Infrared astronomy involves the detection and analysis of infrared radiation (radiation whose wavelength exceeds that of red light). Most of this type of radiation is absorbed by Earth's atmosphere, except for those whose wavelengths are not very different from visible red light. Therefore, observatories that want to observe infrared radiation must be built in places that are high and not damp, or even in space. This spectrum is useful for observing objects that are too cold to emit visible light, such as planets or disks around stars. If the radiation tends to have longer wavelengths, it could also help astronomers observe young stars in molecular clouds and galactic nuclei \u2014 because such radiation is able to penetrate obscuring dust and obscure astronomical observations.",

Therefore, it is the oldest branch, as it requires no equipment. From the late 19th century until about a century later, optical astronomical images used photographic techniques, but before that they had to be drawn by hand. Nowadays digital detectors are used, especially those using CCD (charge-coupled devices). Visible light as it is known has a length from 4,000 \u00c5 to 7,000 \u00c5 (400-700 nm). However, the observation tools used to observe such wavelengths are also used to observe near-ultraviolet and near-infrared waves. Ultraviolet is electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength of about 100 to 3,200 \u00c5 (10-320 nm). Light with this length is absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere, so observing it must be done from the upper atmosphere, or from outside the atmosphere (space). This type of astronomy is suitable for studying the thermal radiation and spectral lines of very high-temperature blue stars (classification OB), because such stars are extremely bright in their ultraviolet radiation \u2014 studies of this kind are frequent and include stars that are in other galaxies. Apart from OB stars, celestial objects that are often observed through this branch of astronomy include planetary nebulae, supernova remnants, or active galactic nuclei. Different settings are required for such purposes because the light is easily swallowed up by interstellar dust. Objects can emit light at the wavelength of X-rays by means of a synchrotron beam (emissions originating from electrons rotating around a magnetic field) or by thermal emission of dense and dilute gas at 107 K.

Permanent and transient sources make up only about 10% of the total number of sources, for example gamma rays from pulsars, neutron stars or active galactic nuclei and candidates black hole. A number of other remote phenomena that take forms other than electromagnetic radiation can be observed from Earth. There is a branch called neutrino astronomy, in which astronomers use underground facilities (eg SAGE, GALLEX, or Kamioka II/III) to detect neutrinos, a form of elementary particle that commonly originates from the Sun or supernova explosions. When cosmic rays enter Earth's atmosphere, the high-energy particles that compose them either decay or are absorbed, and these decayed particles can be detected at observatories. In the future, it is hoped that there will be neutrino detectors that are sensitive to particles born from the collision of cosmic rays and the atmosphere.

Today the tracking of objects close to Earth also allows predictions of close encounters, or even collisions. Then there is the measurement of star parallax. This measurement is very important because it provides a basis for the cosmic distance ladder method; through this method the size and scale of the universe could be known. Measurements of the parallax of relatively closer stars can also be used as an absolute basis for the characteristics of stars that are more distant, because the characteristics between them are comparable. We can then construct their kinematics by measuring the radial velocity and their respective self-propelled motions. Astrometry results can also be used for measurements of dark matter in galaxies.

Theorists attempt to construct theoretical models and infer observable consequences from these models. This will help observers know what data to look for in order to refute a model, or decide which of the alternative, conflicting models is correct. Theorists will also try to compile new models or improve existing models when new data comes in. In the event of conflict/inconsistency, the tendency is to make minimal modifications to the model in question to accommodate the data already obtained. If the conflict is too much, the model can be discarded and not used anymore.

From this disk, lumps of matter are formed through processes involving gravitational attraction, impact, and accretion; these clumps then gradually became a collection of protoplanets. Because the radiation pressure from the solar wind continues to push the matter apart, only planets with a large enough mass can maintain gaseous atmospheres.

Stars form in giant molecular clouds, which are dense areas of dust and gas. When they lose their stability, bits of these clouds can collapse under the force of gravity and form protostars. When the core reaches a certain density and temperature, nuclear fusion will be triggered and a main sequence star will form. Almost all elements heavier than hydrogen and helium are the result of processes that occur in the cores of stars.",

Gradually, this hydrogen fuel will be converted into helium, and the star in question will begin to evolve. To carry out helium fusion, a higher core temperature is required, therefore the core will become denser and the star will double in size \u2014 it has become a red giant. This red giant phase is relatively short, until the helium fuel is also used up. If the star has a very large mass, it will begin evolutionary phases where it gets smaller gradually, because it is forced to carry out nuclear fusion with heavier elements. The ultimate fate of a star also depends on its mass. If its mass is more than about eight times that of our Sun, its core gravity will collapse and produce a supernova; otherwise, it would become a planetary nebula, and continue to evolve into a white dwarf. What remains after the supernova explodes is an incredibly dense neutron star, or, if the remaining matter is three times the mass of the Sun, a black hole. Binary stars that are close together can evolve even more complicatedly, for example, mass transfer to a companion star can occur which can cause a supernova. Planetary nebulae and supernovas are necessary for the distribution of metals in the interstellar medium; otherwise all new stars (and their planetary systems) would be composed of only hydrogen and helium.

Earth itself lies in an outer dusty galactic arm, so much of the Milky Way is not visible. At the center of the galaxy is the core, a kind of rod-shaped bulge; it is believed that there is a supermassive black hole at the center of this. This section is surrounded by four main arms that circle from the center towards the outside, and its contents are rich in star formation phenomena, so it contains many young stars (population I metallicity). This disc is then covered by a ring of galaxies containing older stars (population II metallicity) as well as spherical (globular) star clusters, i.e. a kind of relatively denser star clusters. The region between the stars is called the interstellar medium, which is a region of sparse matter \u2014 the relatively dense parts are molecular clouds filled with hydrogen and other elements, where many new stars are born. Initially a prestellar core or dark nebula would form and then collapse (in a volume determined by the length of Jeans) to build a protostar. When many large stars appear, they transform the molecular cloud into an H II regional cloud, a cloud of glowing gas and plasma. Eventually the winds and supernova explosions from these stars will blow up the remaining clouds, usually producing a new open star cluster (or more). These clusters gradually glowed, and their stars merged with the Milky Way.

Research of objects beyond our galaxy \u2014 extragalactic astronomy \u2014 is a branch that studies the formation and evolution of galaxies, their morphology and classification, as well as observations of active galaxies and their groups and clusters of galaxies. This, especially the latter, is important for understanding the structure of the universe on a large scale. Most galaxies will form certain forms, so that the classification can be arranged based on these forms. Usually, they are divided into spiral, elliptical and irregular galaxies. As the name suggests, elliptical galaxies are shaped like ellipses. The stars rotate in random orbits without going in a clear direction. Galaxies like these contain very little or no interstellar dust; the star-producing areas are not many; and the average occupant of the stars are old. Usually elliptical galaxies are found at the core of galaxy clusters, and can be born through the merger of large galaxies. Spiral galaxies form a rotating flat disk, usually with a bulge or bar in the center and brilliant spiral arms rising from it. These arms are dusty fields where new stars are born, and their inhabitants are young stars of high mass and blue glow. Generally, spiral galaxies will be surrounded by rings of older stars. Examples of galaxies of this kind are the Milky Way and Andromeda. Irregular galaxies are chaotic in shape and don't follow a particular shape, such as a spiral or an ellipse. About a quarter of galaxies are classified as disordered, perhaps caused by gravitational interactions. A galaxy is said to be active when it is emitting a significant amount of energy from sources other than stars, dust, or gas; also, if the source of its energy is from a dense region around the core \u2014 possibly a supermassive black hole emitting radiation from the things it engulfs.",

Examples of such galaxies are the Seyfert, quasar, and blazar galaxies. Quasars are now believed to be the most certainly very bright objects; never found a dim specimen. The large-scale structure of the universe is now described as a collection of galaxy groups and clusters. This structure is classified again in a hierarchical grouping; the largest is the maha-cluster (supercluster). Then these clusters are assembled into the filaments and walls of the galaxy, with the void between them. Cosmology, derived from the Greek kosmos (\u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2, \"world\") and the suffix -logia from logos (\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2, \"learning\") can be understood as the study of the universe as a whole. Observations of the large-scale structure of the universe, a branch known as physical cosmology, have contributed to a deep understanding of the formation and evolution of the universe. One of the most important (and widely accepted) theories is the Big Bang theory, which states that the world began at a single point and expanded over 13.7 billion years to the present day. This idea can be traced back to the discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation in 1965. During this process of development, nature has undergone several stages of evolution. Initially, it was thought that there was a very rapid cosmic inflation, resulting in a homogenization of the initial conditions. After that through nucleosynthesis resulted in the availability of elements for the early period of the universe. (See also nucleocosmochronology.) When the first atoms appeared, space became transparent to radiation, releasing energy now known as CMB radiation.

The material then collects in areas with the highest density, giving birth to the most ancient gas clouds and stars (metallicity III). These massive stars fueled the reionization process and are believed to have created many of the heavy elements in the early universe; these elements tend to decay back into lighter elements, lengthening the cycle. Gravity-induced aggregation causes matter to form into filaments and leave empty spaces between them. Gradually, gas and dust melted down and formed primitive galaxies. Gradually more and more matter was pulled, and arranged into groups and clusters of galaxies. In the end, the even greater giant aggregation materialized. Other objects that play an important role in the structure of the universe are dark matter and dark energy. It is these objects that turn out to be the main components of our world, where their mass reaches 96% of the mass of the entire universe. Therefore, efforts are continuously being made to study and understand the physics of these objects. Astronomy and astrophysics have developed strong links with other branches of science. For example, archaeoastronomy, which studies ancient or traditional astronomy in their respective cultural contexts using archaeological and anthropological evidence. Or astrobiology, this time studying the birth and development of biological systems in the universe; especially on the topic of life on other planets. There is also a branch that researches chemical substances found in outer space; how they manifest, behave, and annihilate. This is called astrochemistry.

What is commonly observed is the Moon, planets, stars, comets, meteor showers, and deep sky objects such as star clusters, galaxies, and nebulae. One branch of amateur astronomy is amateur astrophotography, which involves taking photographs of the night sky. Many choose to become astrophotographers who specialize in certain objects or events. Most amateur astronomers work in optical astronomy, although a small number try to experiment with wavelengths beyond visible light, for example with the infrared filter of an ordinary telescope, or the use of a radio telescope. The pioneer of amateur radio astronomy was Karl Jansky, who started the activity in the 1930's. These amateurs like Jansky use homemade telescopes or professional radio telescopes that are now accessible to amateurs such as the One-Mile Telescope.

All forms of life can be infected by viruses, from animals and plants to bacteria and archaea. The term virus is usually used to describe a type of virus that infects eukaryotic cells, while viruses that infect prokaryotic cells (such as bacteria and archaea) are known as bacteriophages. The existence of viruses was first recognized through Dmitri Ivanovsky's scientific writings in 1892 which described non-bacterial pathogens that infect tobacco plants and the discovery of tobacco mosaic virus by Martinus Beijerinck in 1898. Until 2019, more than 6,000 virus species have been described in detail, of the total millions of types of viruses in the environment. Viruses are found in almost every ecosystem on Earth and are the most numerous biological entities. The study of viruses is known as virology, a subspecialty of microbiology. When infected, the host cell is forced to rapidly produce thousands of identical copies of the original virus. When not inside the cell or in the process of infecting the cell, the virus exists as an independent particle called a virion. A virion consists of two or three parts: (1) genetic material, which is a long molecule of nucleic acid (only DNA or RNA, but not a combination of both) that encodes the protein structure used by the virus; (2) a protein coat called a capsid, which functions to surround and protect the genetic material; and in some viruses there is (3) an outer sheath or envelope made of lipids. The shape of virus particles ranges from simple helical, icosahedral (20-sided shape) to more complex structures.

In evolution, viruses are important intermediates in horizontal gene transfer, which increases genetic diversity in a manner analogous to sexual reproduction. There is scientific disagreement regarding the status of viruses as living things or as organic structures that interact with living things. As life forms, viruses carry genetic material, reproduce, and evolve through natural selection, although they lack key characteristics of living things, such as cell structure, that are generally considered necessary criteria for life. Because they share some of the criteria of being alive but not all of them, viruses are described as \"organisms on the edge of life\", and as self-repliers. Viruses spread in many ways. One route of transmission is through disease-carrying organisms known as vectors: for example, viruses are often transmitted from plant to plant by insects that feed on plant sap, such as aphids; and viruses in animals can be carried by blood-sucking insects. The influenza virus is spread by coughing and sneezing. Norovirus and Rotavirus, common causes of viral gastroenteritis, are transmitted by the faecal\u2013oral route, through hand-to-mouth contact or ingestion of food or water. The infectious dose of Norovirus required to produce infection in humans is less than 100 particles. HIV is one of several viruses that are transmitted through sexual intercourse and exposure to blood containing the virus. The variety of host cells that a virus can infect is called the \"host range\". This range can be narrow, meaning the virus is only capable of infecting a few species, or broad, meaning it is capable of infecting many species.",

An immune response can also be generated by vaccines, which provide artificial immunity against certain viral infections. Several viruses, including those that cause AIDS, human papillomavirus infection, and hepatitis viruses, circumvent this immune response and cause chronic infection. Several antiviral drugs have been developed to treat viral illnesses. The word virus comes from the Latin v\u012brus meaning poison and other noxious liquids, which are further from other Indo-European languages \u200b\u200bsuch as Sanskrit vi\u1e63a, Avesta v\u012b\u0161a and Ancient Greek \u1f30\u03cc\u03c2 which all mean poison. The adjective virulent from the Latin virulentus which means poisonous appeared around 1400. The meaning of virus as \"an agent that causes an infectious disease\" was first used in 1728, long before the discovery of the virus itself by Dmitri Ivanovsky in 1892. Meanwhile, adjectives viral meaning \"of a viral nature or caused by a virus\" did not appear until 1944. The term virion has been in use since 1959 to refer to a single viral particle that escapes from a cell and is capable of infecting other cells of its kind. Viruses have always coexisted with organisms and may have existed since living cells first evolved. Viruses do not leave fossils, so the origin of viruses can only be hypothesized in ways such as molecular biology techniques. In addition, viral genetic material is sometimes integrated into the germlines of their host organisms so that they can be passed vertically to the host's offspring over many generations.

The regression hypothesis cannot explain why even the smallest parasite cells found bear no resemblance to viruses. The leave-of-cell hypothesis cannot account for structures that are unique to viruses and not cells, such as complex capsids. The coevolution hypothesis contradicts the definition of viruses\u2014that they need a host cell\u2014and cannot explain how the first viruses survive and reproduce in the absence of cells. Today viruses are seen as ancient entities and have origins that predate the ramification of life into three domains. This discovery has led modern virologists to reconsider and re-evaluate these three classic hypotheses. Evidence for the RNA world hypothesis and computer analysis of DNA sequences of viruses and their hosts provide a better understanding of the evolutionary relationships among viruses and can help identify the ancestors of modern viruses. Until now, this analysis has not proven which hypothesis is correct. It seems unlikely that all currently known viruses share a common ancestor and viruses may have appeared many times in the past by one or several mechanisms. There is scientific disagreement about whether viruses are classified as living things or simply organic structures that interact with living things. However, they are more often thought of as replicators (substances that carry out DNA replication) and are not considered life forms.

Although some bacteria such as Rickettsia and Chlamydia have the same limitations, they are considered living organisms because they have cells of their own. Virus self-assembly within host cells has implications for the study of the origin of life because it supports the hypothesis that life could have started from self-assembling organic molecules. Viruses are subcellular organisms which, because of their very small size, can only be seen using an electron microscope. They are smaller in size than bacteria so viruses cannot be filtered by bacterial filters. The smallest viruses are only 20 nm in diameter (smaller than a ribosome), whereas even the largest viruses are difficult to see with a light microscope. The viral genome can be either DNA or RNA. The viral genome can consist of double-stranded DNA, single-stranded DNA, double-stranded RNA, or single-stranded RNA. In addition, the nucleic acid of the viral genome can be either single linear or circular. The number of viral genes varies from four for the smallest to several hundred for the largest. The genetic material of most animal and human viruses is DNA, and most plant viruses are single-stranded RNA. Virus genetic material was covered by a protective layer. The protein that forms the protective layer is called the capsid. Depending on the type of virus, the capsid may be spherical, helical, polyhedral, or a more complex shape consisting of the proteins encoded by the viral genome.

For example, in the measles virus, each nucleocapsid protein is linked to six RNA bases to form a helix about 1.3 micrometers long. This complex composition of protein and nucleic acid is called nucleocapsid. In the measles virus, the nucleocapsid is covered by a lipid layer obtained from the host cell, and the glycoprotein encoded by the virus is attached to the lipid envelope. These parts function in binding to and entry into host cells at the start of infection. The spherical viral capsid envelops the entire viral genome and is less tightly bound to the nucleic acid than the helical viruses. These structures can vary in size from 20 nanometers to 400 nanometers and consist of viral proteins arranged in icosahedral symmetry. The amount of protein required to form the spherical viral capsid is determined by the T coefficient, which is about 60t of protein. For example, the hepatitis B virus has a T=4 number, it takes 240 proteins to form the capsid. Like helical viruses, the capsids of some spherical viruses may be enveloped in a lipid layer, but usually the capsid proteins themselves are directly involved in infecting the cell. Several types of viruses have additional elements that help them infect the host. Viruses in animals have a viral envelope, which is a membrane covering the capsid. This sheath contains phospholipids and proteins from the host cell, but also contains proteins and glycoproteins of viral origin. In addition to the envelope protein and capsid protein, viruses also carry several enzyme molecules within their capsid. There are also several types of bacteriophages that have a protein tail attached to the \"head\" of the capsid. The tail fibers are used by phages to attach to a bacterium.

Scientists discover giant viruses known as Mimivirus, Megavirus, and Pandoravirus. Pandoravirus is a very large type of virus with a much larger genome than other viruses that are already known. Pandoravirus is called a super giant virus, because its size beats other giant viruses such as Mimivirus or Megavirus. Despite its gigantic size, it still cannot be seen with the naked eye. This virus was discovered by researchers from France Jean Michael Claverie from the University of the Mediterranean. The Pandoravirus is a thousand times larger than the 100 nanometer influenza virus. The Pandoravirus has 2,556 genes (200 times more than the influenza virus). Pandoravirus is twice as big as Megavirus, which has only 1,120 genes. Viral replication consists of several stages, namely virus attachment, penetration, shedding of the coat, genome replication and gene expression, assembly, maturation, and release. Viral attachment (adsorption) is the initial interaction process between virus particles and receptor molecules on the host cell surface. At this stage, a specific bond occurs between the cellular receptor molecule and the anti-receptor in the virus. Several types of viruses require other molecules for the attachment process, namely coreceptors. The target receptor molecule on the cell surface can be a protein (usually a glycoprotein) or a carbohydrate residue found on glycoproteins or glycolipids. Some complex viruses, such as poxviruses and herpesviruses, have more than one receptor and therefore have several routes to bind to cells. Viral receptors come in several different classes: Some examples of viruses and their receptors: Penetration occurs within a very short time after attachment of the virus to receptors in the cell membrane.",

At this stage the viral genome is exposed in the form of a nucleoprotein complex. In some cases, this step is quite simple and occurs during the fusion of the viral membrane with the plasma membrane. for other viruses, this step is a multistep process involving the endocytosis pathway and the nuclear membrane. The replication strategy of some viruses depends on the natural genetic material of the virus. In this case, viruses are divided into 7 groups like David Baltimore's grouping. The gene expression process will determine all viral infection processes (acute, chronic, persistent, or latent). Assembly is the process of assembling the components of the virion in a special part of the cell. During this process, the structure of the virus particles occurs. This process depends on the replication process in the cell and the place where the virus escapes from the cell. the assembly mechanism varies for different viruses. Example: the assembly process of Picornavirus, Poxvirus, and Reovirus occurs in the cytoplasm, while the assembly process of Adenovirus, Poliovirus, and Parvovirus occurs in the nucleus. Maturation is a stage of the virus life cycle and is infectious. At this stage, there is a structural change in the virus particle which is probably produced by the specific breakdown of the capsid protein to produce a mature product. viral proteases and other cellular enzymes are usually involved in this process. All viruses except plant viruses escape from host cells by two mechanisms: The process of releasing virus particles may be cell-damaging (Paramyxovirus, Rhabdovirus, and Togavirus), and some may be non-cell-damaging (Retroviruses).

In 1962, Andr\u00e9 Lwoff, Robert Horne, and Paul Tournier were the first to develop a grouping of viruses based on Linnaeus' hierarchical system. This system uses the classification of phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species. Viruses are grouped according to their commonalities (not their hosts) and the type of nucleic acid that makes up their genome. In 1966, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) was formed. The system proposed by Lwoff, Horne, and Tournier was never fully accepted by the ICTV because the small size of viral genomes and their high mutation rates made it difficult to define a taxon of viruses above orders (nations). Therefore, the Baltimore classification is used to supplement a more traditional hierarchy. Starting in 2018, ICTV began to acknowledge the deeper evolutionary relationships among viruses that have been discovered and adopted a classification system with 15 levels, from world to species. The International Taxonomy of Viruses Committee (ICTV) developed the classification system used today and wrote guidelines that give greater weight to the properties of certain viruses in order to maintain uniformity of virus families. A unified taxonomy (a universal system for classifying viruses) has been established. New researchers describe a small fraction of the total diversity of viruses that exist on earth. As of 2019, 4 worlds, 9 kingdoms, 16 phyla, 2 subphyla, 36 classes, 55 orders, 8 suborders, 168 families, 103 subfamilies, 1,421 genera, 68 subgenuses and 6,589 virus species have been defined by ICTV.",

As of 2019, the subworld, subkingdom, and subclass tiers are deprecated, while all other tiers are in use. In the virus classification, there is also a taxon which is categorized as incertae sedis or its placement is uncertain. Biologist and Nobel Prize winner David Baltimore devised the Baltimore classification system. In modern virus classification, the ICTV classification system is used in conjunction with the Baltimore classification system. The Baltimore classification of viruses is based on the mechanism of mRNA synthesis. Viruses must generate mRNA from their genomes in order to produce proteins and replicate themselves, but the mechanisms used by viruses to achieve this vary. The viral genome may be single-stranded (abbreviated ss) or double-stranded (abbreviated ds), consisting of either RNA or DNA, and may or may not employ reverse transcriptase (RT). In addition, single-stranded RNA viruses can be either positive (+) or negative (-). This classification places viruses into seven groups: As an example of applying virus classification, the virus that causes chickenpox, namely the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), is placed in the order Herpesvirales, the Herpesviridae family, the Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily, and the Varicellovirus genus. VZV is in Group I of the Baltimore Classification because it is a dsDNA virus that does not use the enzyme reverse transcriptase. The complete set of viruses in an organism or habitat is called a viroma; for example, all human viruses form human viroma. Virus infection in host cells can cause diseases that are categorized as infectious diseases.

Other viruses, such as dengue virus, are spread by blood-sucking insects. Meanwhile, Cytomegalovirus can be passed vertically from pregnant women to the fetus they are carrying. Some viruses exist that can be utilized in genetic recombination. Through gene therapy, the bad (infection-causing) genes contained in the virus are changed into good (cure) genes.

Several Indian tribes have become extinct due to plague, especially smallpox, which was brought by European colonists. Although the exact number is doubtful, it is believed that the deaths occurred in large numbers. This disease indirectly helped European domination in the new American world. One of the viruses that are considered the most dangerous is the filovirus. The Filovirus group consists of Marburg, first discovered in 1967 in Marburg, Germany, and Ebola. Filoviruses are long worm-like viruses, which in large numbers look like a plate of noodles. In April 2005, the Marburg virus attracted press attention with its outbreak in Angola. From October 2004 to 2005, this incident became the worst epidemic in human life. Detection, isolation, and analysis of a virus usually go through a difficult and expensive process. Therefore, research on viral diseases requires large and expensive facilities, including expensive equipment and experts from various fields, such as technicians, molecular biologists, and virologists. Usually this process is carried out by state institutions or carried out in collaboration with other nations through world institutions such as the World Health Organization (WHO). Because it usually manipulates the mechanism of its stem cells to reproduce, viruses are very difficult to kill. The treatment methods so far considered the most effective are vaccinations, to stimulate the body's natural immunity against infectious processes, and drugs that treat symptoms caused by viral infections.",

Immunology chart, measures, and contextualizes the physiological function of the immune system in states of health and disease; immune system damage in immunological disorders (such as autoimmune diseases, hypersensitivity, immune deficiency, and transplant rejection); and physical, chemical, and physiological characteristics of components of the immune system in vitro, in situ, and in vivo. Immunology has applications in various medical disciplines, especially in the fields of organ transplantation, oncology, rheumatology, virology, bacteriology, parasitology, psychiatry and dermatology. Before establishing immunity, from etymological immunos, which is Latin for \"excluded\", early physicians characterized the organs that would later prove to be essential components of the immune system. The important lymphoid organs of the immune system are the thymus, bone marrow, and major lymphatic tissues such as the spleen, tonsils, lymph vessels, lymph nodes, thyroid glands, and liver. When the health condition deteriorates to an emergency status, parts of the immune system organs, including the thymus, spleen, bone marrow, lymph nodes, and other lymphatic tissues, may be surgically removed for examination while the patient is still alive. Many components of the immune system are normally cellular and not associated with any specific organ, but are instead embedded in or circulating in various tissues located throughout the body. Due to the complexity of handling this science (the treatment of one patient and another is not the same), the profession has become less attractive to Indonesian medical personnel.

Proteins have many functions in living things, including accelerating metabolic reactions, replicating DNA, responding to stimuli, giving shape to cells and bodies, and moving molecules from one location to another. The main difference between one protein and another is the sequence of its amino acids, which is determined by the nucleotide sequence of its genes, and usually causes the folding of the protein into a special three-dimensional structure suited to its function. A number of amino acids form a straight chain called a polypeptide. A protein consists of at least one long polypeptide. Short polypeptides (with less than 20\u201330 amino acids) are not usually considered proteins, but are called peptide or oligopeptide molecules. Each amino acid in a protein is bound to a nearby amino acid by a peptide bond. The sequence of amino acids in a protein is determined by the sequence of genes encoded in the genetic code. In general, the genetic code produces a standard 20 amino acids, although some organisms have additional amino acids. Shortly after or even during synthesis, residues in proteins are often chemically modified through posttranslational modification processes that change the physical and chemical properties, folding, stability, activity, and function of the protein. Some proteins have nonpeptide (non-amino acid) groups, which can be called cofactors and prosthetic groups. Some proteins can also work together to carry out specific functions, and such groups often form stable protein complexes. Once formed, proteins exist only for a certain period of time and then are degraded and recycled within the cell through the process of protein turnover. The lifespan of a protein is measured by its half-life and covers a long range.",

Abnormal or misfolded proteins degrade more rapidly, either because they are targeted for destruction or because they are unstable. Along with other giant biomolecules such as polysaccharides and nucleic acids, proteins are an essential part of organisms and are involved in almost all processes in cells. Some proteins are enzymes that function as catalysts in biochemical reactions and are vital for metabolism. Some proteins have a building or strengthening function, for example actin and myosin proteins in muscles and proteins in the cytoskeleton. Other proteins have important roles in cell signaling, immune response, cell adhesion, and cell cycle. Animals need protein in their diet to obtain essential amino acids that cannot be synthesized in the body. The digestive system breaks down protein from food to be used in metabolism. Proteins can be purified from other cellular components using various techniques such as ultracentrifugation, precipitation, electrophoresis and chromatography. Genetic engineering allows a number of methods to facilitate this purification. Methods commonly used to study protein structure and function are immunohistochemistry, site-directed mutagenesis, X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance, and mass spectrometry. Proteins were recognized as a group of biomolecules in the eighteenth century by Antoine Fourcroy and others, characterized by their ability to coagulate or flocculation under treatment with heat or acids. Examples recorded at that time were albumin from egg white, albumin in blood serum, fibrin, and wheat gluten. Proteins were first described by the Dutch chemist Gerardus Johannes Mulder and named by the Swedish chemist J\u00f6ns Jacob Berzelius in 1838. Mulder performed elemental analysis of common proteins and found that almost all proteins have the same empirical formula, namely C400H620N100O120P1S1.",

        "paragraph": "He came to the wrong conclusion that they were probably made up of one type of (very large) molecule. The term \"protein\" to describe these molecules was proposed by Mulder's colleague Berzelius; protein comes from the Greek word \u03c0\u03c1\u03ce\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 (proteios), meaning \"primary\", \"in front of\", or \"standing in front of\", plus the ending -in. Mulder further identified protein degradation products such as the amino acid leucine which he discovered with a molecular weight (almost correct) 131 Da. Before \"protein\", other names had been used, such as \"albumin\" or \"albumin matter\" (Eiweissk\u00f6rper, in German). Early nutritional scientists such as Germany's Carl von Voit believed that protein was the most important nutrient for maintaining body structure because it was commonly believed that \"flesh makes flesh.\" Karl Heinrich Ritthausen expanded on the known forms of protein by identifying glutamic acid. At the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, a detailed overview of plant proteins was collected by Thomas Burr Osborne. He worked with Lafayette Mendel and applied Liebig's law of minimums to feeding laboratory mice, so that the presence of essential amino acids was known. This work was continued and communicated by William Cumming Rose. The understanding of proteins as polypeptides emerged through the work of Franz Hofmeister and Hermann Emil Fischer in 1902. The central role of proteins as enzymes in living organisms was not fully appreciated until 1926 when James B. Sumner showed that the enzyme urease was actually a protein. The difficulty of purifying large quantities of protein made it very difficult for early protein biochemists to study. Therefore, early research focused on proteins that could be purified in large quantities, for example from blood, egg white, various poisons, and digestive/metabolic enzymes obtained from slaughterhouses. In the 1950s, the Armor Hot Dog Co. purified 1\u00a0kg of ribonuclease A from pure cow pancreas and made it available free to scientists; this movement helped ribonuclease A become a major target of biochemical studies over the following decades.",

Later, Walter Kauzmann's work on denaturation, which was based in part on earlier work by Kaj Linderstr\u00f8m-Lang, shed light on the protein folding and structure mediated by hydrophobic interactions. The first protein sequenced was insulin, by Frederick Sanger, in 1949. Sanger precisely determined the amino acid sequence of insulin thereby conclusively demonstrating that proteins consisted of linear polymers of amino acids rather than branched, colloidal, or cyclonic chains. He won the Nobel Prize for this achievement in 1958. The first known protein structures were hemoglobin and myoglobin, by Max Perutz and Sir John Cowdery Kendrew, respectively, in 1958. As of 2017update], the Protein Data Bank has over 126,060 protein structures with atomic resolution. More recently, cryo-electron microscopy of large macromolecule assemblages and computational protein structure prediction of small protein domains are two methods that approach atomic resolution. The number of encoded proteins in the genome corresponds roughly to the number of genes (although there may be a large number of genes encoding RNA proteins, such as ribosomal RNA). Viruses typically encode several hundred proteins, archaea and bacteria several hundred to several thousand, while eukaryotes typically encode several thousand to tens of thousands of proteins (see genome size for a list of examples). Protein is a very large biomolecule or macrobiopolymer composed of monomers in the form of amino acids. There are 20 standard amino acids that make up amino acids (called proteinogenic amino acids); each consists of an alpha carbon bonded to an amino group (\u2013NH2), a carboxyl group (\u2013COOH), a hydrogen atom (H), and a side chain (referred to as \"R\").",

Only proline differs from this basic structure in that it contains an unusual ring on the N-terminated amine group, which forces the CO\u2013NH amide group into a fixed conformation. The standard amino acid side chains, detailed in the list of standard amino acids, have a wide variety of chemical structures and properties. The three-dimensional structure and chemical reactivity of a protein is determined by the combined effect of all the amino acid side chains in the protein. All the amino acids in the polypeptide chain are interconnected by peptide bonds through dehydration synthesis. Once connected in a protein chain, the individual amino acids are called residues, while the linked sets of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen atoms are called the main chain or protein backbone. The terms protein, polypeptide, and peptide are somewhat ambiguous and can overlap in meaning. Protein is generally used to refer to complete biological molecules in a stable conformation, whereas peptides generally refer to short amino acid oligomers that often lack a stable three-dimensional structure. However, the boundary between the two is not well defined and is usually in the range of 20\u201330 residues. Polypeptide can refer to a single linear chain of amino acids, usually of any length, but often implies not having a fixed conformation. Proteins can interact with many types of molecules, including with other proteins, with lipids, with carbohydrates, and with DNA. It is estimated that the average sized bacterium contains about two million proteins per cell (eg Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus). Smaller bacteria, such as Mycoplasma or spirocket contain less protein, about 50,000 to 1 million.",

For example, the cell of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is estimated to contain about 50 million proteins and that of the human cell from 1 to 3 billion. The concentration of individual protein copies ranges from a few molecules per cell to 20 million per cell. Not all genes encoding proteins are expressed in most cells and their number depends on several things, such as cell type and external stimuli. For example, of the approximately 20,000 proteins encoded by the human genome, only 6,000 are detectable in lymphoblastoid cells. Proteins are assembled from a number of amino acids using the information encoded in the genes. Each protein has its own unique amino acid sequence which is determined by the nucleotide sequence of the genes encoding this protein. The genetic code is a set of three nucleotides called codons and each combination of three nucleotides indicates an amino acid, for example AUG (adenine\u2013uracil\u2013guanine) is the code for methionine. Since DNA contains four nucleotides, the total number of possible codons is 64; therefore, there is some redundancy in the genetic code, with some amino acids being specified by more than one codon. Genes encoded in DNA are first transcribed into pre-RNA mRNAs by proteins such as RNA polymerase. Most organisms then process the pre-mRNA (also known as primary transcript) using various forms of post-transcription modification to form the mature mRNA, which is then used as a template for protein synthesis by ribosomes. In prokaryotes, mRNA can be used as soon as it is produced or bound by the ribosome as it moves away from the nucleoid. In contrast, eukaryotes make mRNA in the cell nucleus and then translocate it across the nuclear membrane into the cytoplasm, where protein synthesis then occurs. The rate of protein synthesis in prokaryotes is higher than that of eukaryotes and can reach up to 20 amino acids per second.",

Next, the mRNA is loaded onto the ribosome and read three nucleotides at a time by matching each codon with a base pair anticodon located on a transfer RNA (tRNA) molecule, which carries the amino acid corresponding to the codon it recognizes. The tRNA-aminoacyl synthetase enzyme \"loads\" the tRNA molecule with the correct amino acid. The polypeptide that is being formed is often called the nascent chain. Proteins are always synthesized from the N-terminus to the C-terminus. The size of a protein synthesized can be measured by the number of amino acids it contains and by its total molecular mass, which is usually reported in units of daltons (synonymous with atomic mass units), or derived units of kilodaltons (kDa). The average size of proteins increases progressively from archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes (283, 311, 438 amino residues and 31.34, 49 kDa, respectively) because more protein domains compose proteins in higher organisms. For example, the average yeast protein has a length of 466 amino acids and a mass of 53 kDa. The largest known protein is titin, a component of the muscle sarcomere, with a molecular mass of nearly 3,000 kDa and a total length of nearly 27,000 amino acids. Short proteins can also be synthesized chemically by a class of methods known as peptide synthesis, which rely on organic synthesis techniques such as chemical ligation to produce large quantities of peptides. Chemical synthesis makes it possible to incorporate non-natural amino acids into polypeptide chains, such as attaching fluorescent probes to amino acid side chains. This method is useful in biochemistry and cell biology laboratories, although generally not for commercial applications. Chemical synthesis is inefficient for polypeptides longer than about 300 amino acids, and the synthesized protein may not readily assume its original tertiary structure.",

Most of the proteins are folded into a unique three-dimensional structure. The natural shape of a folded protein is known as the original conformation. Although many proteins can fold unaided and solely through the chemical properties of their amino acids, a number of other proteins require the assistance of companion proteins to fold into their native state. Biochemists often refer to four different aspects of protein structure. The primary structure of a protein can be determined by several methods: (1) protein hydrolysis with a strong acid (eg, 6N HCl), then the amino acid composition is determined with an amino acid analyzer instrument, (2) sequence analysis of the N-terminus is carried out by Edman degradation, ( 3) combination of digestion with trypsin and mass spectrometry, and (4) determination of molecular mass by mass spectrometry. The secondary structure can be determined by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The CD spectrum of the alpha-thread shows two negative absorbances at 208 and 220 nm and the beta-plate shows one negative peak around 210\u2013216 nm. Estimation of the secondary structural composition of the protein can be calculated from the CD spectrum. In the FTIR spectrum, the amide-I band of the alpha-loop is different compared to the amide-I band of the beta-plate. Thus, the composition of the secondary structure of the protein can also be estimated from the infrared spectrum. Proteins are not completely rigid molecules. In addition to these levels of structure, proteins can change between several related structures as they carry out their functions. In this context of functional rearrangement, the tertiary or quaternary structure is usually referred to as a \"conformation\", and the transition between the two is called a conformational change. Such changes are often caused by the binding of substrate molecules to the active site of the enzyme, or the physical region of the protein that participates in chemical catalysis.",

Informally, proteins can be divided into three major classes that correlate with a characteristic tertiary structure: globular proteins, fibrous proteins, and membrane proteins. Almost all globular proteins are soluble and many of them are enzymes. Fibrous proteins are often structural in nature, such as collagen (a major component of connective tissue) or keratin (a component of hair and nails proteins). Membrane proteins often function as receptors or provide channels for polar or charged molecules to pass through the cell membrane. Dehydrons are a special case of intramolecular hydrogen bonds in proteins, which are poorly protected from water attack and thereby promote their own dehydration. Another well-known protein structure is the domain, which is a protein segment that folds into distinct structural units. This structure consists of 40\u2013350 amino acids. Simple proteins generally have only one domain. In more complex proteins, several domains are involved. The polypeptide chain relationships that play a role in it will give rise to a new function different from its constituent components. If the domain structure in this complex structure is separated, then the biological function of each component of the constituent domain is not lost. This is what distinguishes the domain structure from the quaternary structure. In the quaternary structure, after the complex structure is separated, the protein is not functional. The domains usually have a specific function, such as enzymatic activity (eg kinase) or function as a binding module (eg SH3 domain binds to a proline-rich sequence in another protein). Short amino acid sequences in proteins often act as recognition sites for other proteins. For example, the SH3 domain usually binds a short PxxP motif (i.e. 2 proline P], which are separated by two unspecified x] amino acids, although the surrounding amino acids may determine the specificity of the exact binding).",

Proteins are the main actors in the cell, carrying out tasks determined by the information encoded in the genes. With the exception of certain types of RNA, most other biological molecules are relatively inert elements on which proteins act. Protein makes up half of the dry weight of Escherichia coli cells, while other macromolecules such as DNA and RNA contribute only 3% and 20%, respectively. The collection of proteins expressed in a particular cell or cell type is known as a proteoma. A key characteristic of proteins that also enables their various functions is their ability to specifically and tightly bind to other molecules. The area of \u200b\u200ba protein responsible for binding to other molecules is known as a binding site and is often a depression or \"pocket\" on the surface of the molecule. This binding ability is mediated by the tertiary structure of the protein which defines the binding site pocket, and by the chemical properties of the side chains of the surrounding amino acids. Protein binding can be very tight and specific; for example, the ribonuclease inhibitor protein binds to human angiogenin at a subfemtomolar dissociation constant (<10\u221215 M) but does not bind at all to its amphibian homologue, the onconase (>1 M). Very small chemical changes such as the addition of a methyl group to the bond-pair are sometimes enough to almost break the binding; for example, the enzyme aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, which is specific for the amino acid valine, does not bind to the side chain of the very similar amino acid isoleucine. Proteins can bind to other proteins and also bind to small molecule substrates. When proteins bind specifically with other copies of the same molecule, they can undergo oligomerization to form fibrils; this process occurs frequently in structural proteins consisting of globular monomers that self-link to form rigid fibers.",

Because the interactions between proteins are reversible and depend heavily on the availability of protein pairs to form aggregates capable of carrying out different sets of functions, the study of the interactions between specific proteins is key to understanding important aspects of cellular function, and ultimately the properties that differentiate cell types. certain. The most well-known role of proteins in cells is that of enzymes, which catalyze chemical reactions. Enzymes are usually very specific and only speed up one or a few chemical reactions. Enzymes carry out most of the reactions involved in metabolism, as well as manipulating DNA in processes such as DNA replication, DNA repair, and transcription. Some enzymes act on other proteins to add or remove chemical groups in a process known as posttranslational modification. About 4,000 reactions are catalyzed by enzymes. The rate acceleration afforded by enzymatic catalysis is often enormous, up to a 1017-fold increase in rate compared to the uncatalyzed reaction in the case of orotate decarboxylase (78 million years without enzyme, 18 milliseconds with enzyme). The molecule that is bound and acted upon by an enzyme is called a substrate. Although enzymes may consist of hundreds of amino acids, usually only a small fraction of the residues are in contact with the substrate, and an even smaller fraction\u2014an average of three to four residues\u2014is directly involved in catalysis.

Some proteins, such as insulin, are extracellular proteins that transmit signals from the cell where they are synthesized (ie pancreatic cells) to other cells in distant tissues. Another type are membrane proteins which act as receptors whose main function is to bind to signaling molecules and induce biochemical responses within the cell. Many receptors have exposed binding sites on the cell surface and effector domains inside the cell, which may have enzymatic activity or may undergo conformational changes that are detected by other proteins in the cell. Antibodies are proteins that are components of the adaptive immune system whose main function is to bind to antigens (foreign substances in the body) and target them for destruction. Antibodies can be secreted into the extracellular environment or anchored in the membranes of specialized B cells known as plasma cells. While enzymes are limited in binding affinity for their substrates by their need to carry out reactions, antibodies have no such limitation. The binding affinity of the antibody to its target is very high. Many ligand transport proteins bind to specific small biomolecules and transport them to other locations in the body of multicellular organisms. This protein must have a high binding affinity when the ligand is present in high concentrations, but must also release the ligand when it is at low concentration in the target tissue. An example of a ligand-binding protein is hemoglobin, which transports oxygen from the lungs to other organs and tissues in all vertebrates and has similar homologs in every biological kingdom.

The membrane itself has a hydrophobic center so that polar or charged molecules cannot diffuse. Membrane proteins contain internal channels that allow these molecules to enter and leave the cell. Many ion channel proteins are specialized to select only certain ions; for example, potassium and sodium channels often only facilitate specific ions. Structural proteins impart hardness and rigidity to liquid biological components. Most of the structural proteins are fibrous proteins; for example collagen and elastin are important components of connective tissues such as cartilage, while keratin is found in hard or filamentous structures such as hair, nails, fur, hooves, and some animal shells. Some globular proteins can also have a structural function, for example actin and tubulin which are globular and soluble as monomers, but polymerize to form long, stiff fibers that make up the cytoskeleton, which allows the cell to maintain its shape and size. Other proteins that have a structural function are motor proteins such as myosin, kinesin, and dynein, which are capable of generating mechanical forces. These proteins are essential for cellular motility in single-celled organisms and sperm in many multicellular organisms that reproduce sexually.

Conversely, in vivo experiments can provide information about the physiological role of proteins in the context of cells or even organisms as a whole. In silico studies use computational methods to study proteins. To perform in vitro analysis, the protein must be purified from other cellular components. This process usually begins with cell lysis, when the cell membrane is disrupted and its internal contents are released into a solution known as crude lysate. The resulting mixture can be purified using ultracentrifugation, which fractionates the various cellular components into soluble protein-containing fractions; lipid and protein membranes; cellular organelles, and nucleic acids. Precipitation by a method known as salt-induced precipitation concentrates the protein from this lysate. Various types of chromatography are then used to isolate the desired protein based on properties such as molecular weight, net charge, and binding affinity. The degree of purification can be monitored using various types of gel electrophoresis if the molecular weight and isoelectric point of the protein of interest are known, by spectroscopy if the protein has distinguishable spectroscopic features, or by enzyme assays if the protein has enzymatic activity. Moreover, proteins can be isolated according to their charge using electrical focusing. For naturally occurring proteins, a series of purification steps may be required to obtain a sufficiently pure protein for laboratory application. To simplify this process, genetic engineering is often used to add chemical properties to proteins that make them easier to purify without affecting their structure or activity.

The study of proteins in vivo is often concerned with the synthesis and localization of proteins within cells. Although many intracellular proteins are synthesized in the cytoplasm and membrane-bound or secreted proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the specific ways in which proteins are targeted to specific organelles or cellular structures are often unclear. A useful technique for assessing cellular localization is to use genetic engineering to express within the cell a fusion protein or chimera consisting of a naturally occurring protein of interest linked to a \"reporter\" such as green fluorescent protein (GFP). The position of fused proteins in the cell can be visualized cleanly and efficiently using a microscope, as shown in the figure. Other methods of elucidating the cellular location of proteins require the use of compartment markers for regions such as the ER, Golgi bodies, lysosomes or vacuoles, mitochondria, chloroplasts, plasma membranes, and others. With the use of fluorescent markers or antibodies to markers, identification of the desired protein localization will become easier. For example, indirect immunofluorescence will allow fluorescence colocalization and location demonstration. Fluorescent dyes are used to label cellular compartments for the same purpose. Other possibilities also exist. For example immunohistochemistry typically uses an antibody to one or more of the proteins of interest, which is conjugated to an enzyme that produces a luminous or chromogenic signal that can be compared between samples, allowing localization information.

The gold standard method for cellular localization is immunoelectron microscopy. This technique also uses antibodies against the protein of interest, which employs the classical electron microscopy technique. The sample is prepared for normal electron microscopic examination and then treated with antibodies against the desired protein conjugated to a highly electro-dense material, usually gold. This allows for the localization of both the ultrastructural and protein details of interest. Through another application of genetic engineering known as site-directed mutagenesis, researchers are able to alter protein sequences and their structure, cellular localization, and susceptibility to regulation. This technique even allows the incorporation of unnatural amino acids into proteins using modified tRNAs, and enables the rational design of new proteins with novel properties. The number of complement proteins present at one time in a cell or cell type is known as the proteome, and the study of such large-scale data sets is proteomics, which is named after its analogue in the genome, genomics. The main experimental techniques in proteomics include 2D electrophoresis which allows the separation of multiple proteins, mass spectrometry which allows high-speed identification of proteins and rapid sequencing of peptides (most often after digestion in gels), protein micro-arrangements which allow detection of the amount of various proteins present in cell-relative, and two-hybrid screening which allows systematic exploration of protein-protein interactions. The number of biologically possible complements of such interactions is known as an interactionoma. The systematic attempt to determine the protein structure that represents every possible fold is known as structural genomics.

It is impossible to study all proteins experimentally so only a few proteins are subjected to laboratory experiments. Meanwhile, computational tools were used to extrapolate to similar proteins. Homologous proteins can be efficiently identified in distantly related organisms through sequence alignment. Genome and gene sequences can be searched with a variety of tools for specific properties. Sequence profiling tools can locate restriction enzyme sites, read open sequences in nucleotide sequences, and predict protein secondary structure. Phylogenetic trees can be created and evolutionary hypotheses developed using specialized software such as ClustalW to find out the ancestors of modern organisms and the genes they expressed. The field of bioinformatics is indispensable for the analysis of genes and proteins. Discovery of the tertiary structure of a protein, or the quaternary structure of a protein complex, can provide important clues about how the protein performs its function and how this function can be influenced, for example in drug design. Because proteins are too small to be seen under a light microscope, other methods must be used to determine their structure. Common experimental methods include X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy, both of which can provide structural information at atomic resolution. NMR experiments are able to provide information from which a subset of the distances between pairs of atoms can be estimated, and the final probable conformation of a protein is determined by solving geometric distance problems. Multiple polarization interferometry is a quantitative analytical method for measuring the overall protein conformation and conformational changes due to interactions or other stimuli. Circular dichroism is another laboratory technique for determining the composition of the alpha-strands or internal beta-sheets of proteins.",

Completed structures are usually stored in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), a freely available resource regarding structural data of thousands of proteins which can be obtained in the form of Cartesian coordinates for each atom in a protein. Much more is known about the sequence of genes than the structure of proteins. Furthermore, the set of resolved protein structures is likely to be biased towards proteins that can easily undergo the conditions required for X-ray crystallography, one of the principal methods of protein structure determination. In particular, globular proteins are comparatively easy to crystallize in preparation for X-ray crystallography. In contrast, membrane proteins and large protein complexes are difficult to crystallize and are underrepresented in GDP. Structural genomics has attempted to correct this shortcoming by systematically solving the representative structures of the major folding classes. Protein structure prediction methods try to find ways to generate plausible structures for proteins whose structures have not been determined experimentally. To complement the field of structural genomics, protein structure prediction develops mathematical models of proteins that are efficient for predicting molecular formations computationally in theory, instead of detecting structures by laboratory observations. The most successful type of structure prediction, known as homology modeling, relies on the existence of a \"template\" structure with sequence similarity to the protein being modeled; the goal of structural genomics is to provide sufficient representation of the resolved structures to model most of the remaining structures. Although generating an accurate model remains a challenge when only remotely related template structures are available, it was concluded that sequence alignment is a bottleneck in this process because a sufficiently accurate model can be generated if a \"perfect\" sequence alignment is known.",

Mathematical models to simulate the dynamic processes of protein folding and binding involve molecular mechanics, particularly molecular dynamics. Monte Carlo techniques facilitate computation, which takes advantage of advances in parallel and distributed computing (eg the Folding@home project which performs molecular modeling on GPUs). In silico simulations found folding domains of small alpha-stranded proteins such as the heads of vilin proteins and HIV accessory proteins. Hybrid methods that combine standard molecular dynamics with the mathematics of quantum mechanics have explored the electronic state of rhodopsin.

Therefore, predicting and analyzing protein abnormalities is an important part of protein structure characterization. Most microorganisms and plants can biosynthesize to produce all 20 standard amino acids, whereas animals (including humans) must obtain some amino acids from food. Amino acids that cannot be synthesized by organisms are called essential amino acids. Key enzymes that synthesize certain amino acids are absent in animals\u2014such as aspartokinase, which catalyzes the first step in the synthesis of lysine, methionine, and threonine from aspartate. If amino acids are present in the environment, microorganisms can conserve energy by taking amino acids from their environment and deriving their biosynthetic pathways. In animals, amino acids are obtained through the consumption of foods containing protein.

In animals such as dogs and cats, protein maintains the health and quality of the skin by promoting the growth of hair follicles and keratinization, thereby reducing the possibility of the appearance of a foul odor on the skin. Poor quality protein also plays a role in gastrointestinal health by increasing the potential for gas and odor compounds in dogs because when proteins reach the large intestine undigested, they are fermented to produce hydrogen sulfide gas, indole and skatole. Dogs and cats digest animal protein better than plant protein, but low-quality animal products are poorly digested, including skin, fur and connective tissue. Lack of protein can cause hair loss (hair consists of 97-100% of keratin) to malnutrition, protein deficiency disease. Continuous protein deficiency causes marasmus and results in death.

One group of rabbits was given animal protein food, while the other group was given vegetable protein.

Egyptian astronomers left monuments showing knowledge of the constellations and the motions of the celestial bodies, while the Greek poet Homer described various celestial bodies in his Iliad and Odyssey; later Greek astronomers gave the names, which are still used today, to most of the constellations visible from the northern hemisphere. Natural philosophy originated in Greece in the Archaic period, (650 BCE \u2013 480 BCE), when pre-Socratic philosophers such as Thales rejected non-naturalistic explanations for natural phenomena and argued that every event had a natural cause. They proposed ideas that were proven by reason and observation, and many of their hypotheses proved successful in experiments; for example, atomism was finally confirmed 2,000 years after it was first proposed by Leucippus and his student Democritus. Islamic scholars had inherited Aristotelian physics from the Greeks and during the Golden Age of Islam increasingly advanced, placing observation and a priori thinking as their focus, developing early forms of the scientific method.

These laws of classical physics are still widely used today for everyday objects traveling at non-relativistic speeds, because they provide very good approximations of those conditions. Theories such as quantum mechanics and relativistic theory can be reduced to their classical equivalents. However, the inaccuracy of classical mechanics for very small bodies and very fast objects led to the development of modern physics in the 20th century. Modern physics has its origins in the early 20th century when Max Planck did research on quantum theory and Albert Einstein did research on the theory of relativity. Both of these theories arose due to the inaccuracies of classical mechanics under certain conditions. Classical mechanics predicts that the speed of light varies, not according to the constant speed predicted by Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism. This error was eventually corrected by Einstein through his theory of special relativity, which later replaced classical mechanics for fast-moving objects and speeds close to the speed of light. Black-body radiation was also a problem for classical physics, which was later corrected when Planck proposed that the excitation of a material oscillator is possible only in discrete steps proportional to its frequency. This theory, along with the photoelectric effect and later the more complete theory of predicting the discrete energy levels of electron orbitals, eventually allowed the theory of quantum mechanics to replace classical physics at the infinitesimal level. Quantum mechanics appeared pioneered by Werner Heisenberg, Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger and Paul Dirac. From the results of this early work, the standard model of particle physics was derived.

Hydrophobic molecules in water often cluster together, forming micelles. Water on a hydrophobic surface will exhibit a high contact angle. Examples of hydrophobic molecules include alkanes, oils, fats, and oily substances in general. Hydrophobic materials are used for oil removal from water, oil spill management, and chemical separation processes to remove non-polar substances from polar compounds. Hydrophobic is often used interchangeably with lipophilic, \"fat-loving\". However, the two terms are not synonymous. While hydrophobic substances are usually lipophilic, there are exceptions\u2014such as silicones and fluorocarbons. The term hydrophobic comes from the Ancient Greek \u1f51\u03b4\u03c1\u03cc\u03c6\u03bf\u03b2\u03bf\u03c2, \"to have a fear of water\", a construction of \u1f55\u03b4\u03c9\u03c1, \"water\", and \u03c6\u03cc\u03b2\u03bf\u03c2, \"to be afraid\". Hydrophobic interactions are largely an entropic effect that originates from the disruption of the highly dynamic hydrogen bonds between liquid water molecules by nonpolar solutes that form clathrate structures around non-polar molecules. This structure forms higher than that of free water molecules because the water molecules organize themselves to interact as much as possible with themselves, and thus produce a higher entropic state which causes the non-polar molecules to cluster together to reduce the surface area exposed to water as well as reduce the entropy of the system. . Thus, the two immiscible phases (hydrophilic vs. hydrophobic) will change so that the corresponding interfacial area will be minimal.",

Superhydrophobic surfaces, such as the leaves of the lotus plant, are very difficult plants to wet. The contact angle of the water drop exceeds 150\u00b0. This is referred to as the Lotus effect, and is primarily a physical property related to surface tension, not a chemical property. In 1805, Thomas Young defined the contact angle \u03b8 by analyzing the force acting on a drop of liquid resting on a solid surface surrounded by gas. where \u03b8 can be measured using a contact angle goniometer. Wenzel determined that when the liquid comes into contact with the microsurface, \u03b8 will change to \u03b8W* where r is the ratio of the actual area to the projected area. The Wenzel equation shows that the microstructure of a surface enhances the natural tendency of the surface. Hydrophobic surfaces (those with an original contact angle greater than 90\u00b0) become more hydrophobic as their new microstructure \u2013 contact angle becomes larger than the original. However, hydrophilic surfaces (those with an original contact angle of less than 90\u00b0) become more hydrophilic when micro-fabricated \u2013 the new contact angle becomes smaller than the original. Cassie and Baxter found that if the liquid is suspended at the top of the microstructure, \u03b8 will change to \u03b8CB*: where \u03c6 is the area of \u200b\u200bthe solid fraction touching the liquid. The fluid in the Cassie-Baxter state is more mobile than in the Wenzel state. We can predict whether a Wenzel or a Cassie-Baxter state should exist by calculating the new contact angle with both equations. By minimizing the free energy argument, the relationship predicts that a smaller contact angle is the most likely state to exist. Stated in mathematical terms, for the Cassie-Baxter state to exist, the following inequalities must be true.",

        "paragraph": "A recent alternative criterion for the Cassie-Baxter state asserts that the Cassie-Baxter state exists when 2 of the following criteria are met: 1) Line contact forces overcome body forces from the weight of the unsupported drop and 2) The microstructure is high enough to prevent liquid bridging the microstructure. to touch the base of the microstructure. New criteria for switching between the Wenzel and Cassie-Baxter states have been developed recently based on surface roughness and surface energy. These criteria focus on the ability of air trapping under liquid droplets on a rough surface, which can tell whether the Wenzel model or the Cassie-Baxter model should be used for a given combination of surface roughness and energy. The contact angle is a measure of static hydrophobicity, and the hysteresis of contact angle and shear angle are dynamic measures. The hysteresis contact angle is a phenomenon that characterizes surface heterogeneity. When a pipette injects liquid into a solid, the liquid forms several contact angles. As the pipette injects more liquid, the droplet will increase in volume, the contact angle will increase, but the three-phase boundary will remain stationary until it suddenly advances outwards. Dettre and Johnson discovered in 1964 that the superhydrophobic phenomenon, the Lotus effect is related to a rough hydrophobic surface, and they developed a theoretical model based on experiments with glass beads coated with paraffin or TFE telomeres. The self-cleaning properties of surface superhydrophobic micro-nanostructures were reported in 1977. Perfluoroalkyl, perfluoropolyether and RF plasma forming superhydrophobic materials were developed, used for electrowetting and commercialized for bio-medical applications between 1986 and 1995. The technology and other applications have emerged since the Middle Ages. the 1990s. A durable superhydrophobic hierarchical composition, applied in one or two steps, was disclosed in 2002 consisting of nano-sized particles \u2264 100 nanometers coating a surface having micrometer-sized features or particles \u2264 100 micrometers.",

Space-time is usually described by space in three dimensions and time plays the role of a fourth dimension which is a different part of the spatial dimension. From the Euclidean perspective of space, the universe has three dimensions of space plus time. By combining space and time into a single manifold, physicists have significantly simplified a large number of theories in physics and have a more uniform understanding of the workings of the universe in the realms of cosmology and quantum mechanics. In non-relativistic classical mechanics, use of Euclidean space would be more appropriate than use of space-time, because time is treated as a constant, universal factor, independent of motion and of the observer. In the context of the theory of relativity, time cannot be separated from three-dimensional space because the speeds of an object and an observer are relative and can be affected by gravitational fields which can slow down time. In cosmology, the concept of space-time combines space and time into one abstract universe. Mathematically, space-time is a manifold consisting of events that can be described by a coordinate system. Three dimensions (length, width, and height) and one temporal dimension (i.e. time) are needed. Dimensions are independent components of the coordinate grid for determining points in a defined space. For example, in a globe there are latitude and longitude which are two independent coordinates that together can form a unique point. In space and time, coordinate grids that extend to 3+1 dimensions determine events (not just points in space), and time is added in other dimensions to coordinate grids.",

There are only two ancient sources that speak of this period in the life of Thrasymakus. First, Aristophanes' book The Banqueters alludes to the existence of Thrasymakus. The book was written in 427 BC so it can be concluded that in that year Thrasymakos was known in Athens. Second, in Plato's work entitled \"Republic\", there is a sentence from the words of Thrasymacus which shows he lived at the time Archelaos, king of Macedonia, made an attack on Thessaly.

The term anatomy is used for the study of the structure of the human and animal bodies, while the structure of plants is studied in plant anatomy. Anatomy has been studied since prehistoric times. Anatomy and physiology, which study the structure and function of organisms and their parts respectively, are natural partners of related disciplines, and the two are often studied together. Human anatomy is one of the essential basic sciences applied in medicine. The discipline of anatomy is broadly divided into macroscopic and microscopic anatomy. Macroscopic anatomy, or gross anatomy, is the examination of body parts using unaided vision. Macroscopic anatomy also includes superficial anatomy. Microscopic anatomy involves the use of optical instruments to study tissue, which is known as histology, and also in the study of cells. Historically, anatomy has experienced a progressive development of the understanding of the structure and function of the human body. The methods used have improved dramatically, from examining animals by cadaveric and carcass dissection to medical imaging techniques developed in the 20th century, such as X-rays, ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging.

The discipline of anatomy can be subdivided into several branches, including macroscopic anatomy and microscopic anatomy. Macroscopic anatomy is the study of structures large enough to be seen with the naked eye, and also includes surface or superficial anatomy, the study of the external characteristics of the body. Microscopic anatomy is the study of body structure on a microscopic scale, along with histology (the study of tissues) and embryology (the study of organisms in prenatal conditions). Anatomy can be studied using both invasive and noninvasive methods with the aim of obtaining information about the structure and organization of organs and organ systems. Methods used include dissection, in which the body is opened and the organs studied, and endoscopy, in which instruments equipped with a video camera are inserted through small incisions on the surface of the body and used to explore internal organs and other structures. Angiography using X-rays or magnetic resonance angiography is a method for visualizing blood vessels. The term \"anatomy\" is usually used to refer to human anatomy. However, substantially the same structures and tissues are found throughout the animal kingdom and the term also includes the anatomy of other animals. The term zootomy is also sometimes used to specifically refer to the anatomy of nonhuman animals. Plant structures and tissues have different properties and are studied in plant anatomy. All vertebrates have a similar basic body cross-section and at some point in their lives (mostly at the embryonic stage), they share the main chordate characteristics, namely, the notochord which is a rigid rod; hollow neuronal tube dorsally and filled with neural material; pharyngeal arches; and a tail behind the anus.",

At the posterior end is the tail which is a continuation of the spine and spinal cord, but not a continuation of digestion. The mouth is found at the anterior end of the animal, while the anus is found at the base of the tail. A specific characteristic of vertebrates is the vertebral column, which is formed by serial and segmented development of the vertebrae. In most vertebrates, the notochord becomes the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral disc. However, some other vertebrates, such as the sturgeon and coelacanth, retain the notochord into adulthood. Jawed vertebrates are characterized by paired extremities, fins, or legs and may be lost secondarily. Vertebrate limbs are considered homologous because they share the same basic skeletal structure inherited from their most recent common ancestor. This is one of the arguments put forward by Charles Darwin to support his theory of evolution. The body of a fish is divided into a head, body and tail, although the division between these is not always visible from the outside. The skeleton, which forms the supporting structure inside the fish, can be made of cartilage in Chondrichthyes or bone in Osteichthyes. The main skeletal element is the vertebral column, which is composed of a series of light but strong articulated vertebrae. The ribs of fish are attached to the vertebral column and they have neither extremities (limbs) nor extremity bands. The main external characteristics of fish, namely the fins, are not directly related to the vertebral column, except for the caudal fin.

Anatomy developed little from classical times to the 16th century; as the historian Marie Boas wrote, \"Progress in anatomy before the 16th century was mysteriously slow, just as its development after 1500 was staggering\". :120\u2013121 Between 1275 and 1326, the anatomists Mondino de Luzzi, Alessandro Achillini, and Antonio Benivieni in Bologna performed the first systematic human dissections since ancient times. Mondino's Anatomy in 1316 was the first textbook in the Middle Ages to reconstruct the understanding of human anatomy. This book describes the body in the order in which Mondino dissections performed it, starting with the abdomen, then the chest, then the head, and the limbs.",

Leonardo da Vinci (1452\u20131519), who was given knowledge of anatomy by Andrea del Verrocchio, used this knowledge in his art and made many sketches of the skeletal structures, muscles, and organs of humans and other vertebrates he dissected. Andreas Vesalius (1514\u20131564), professor of anatomy at the University of Padova from the Duchy of Brabant, is considered the father of modern human anatomy. He published the influential book, De humani corporis fabrica (\"the structure of the human body\"), a large format book in seven volumes, in 1543. The accurate illustrations and intricate detail, often depicted in allegorical poses on Italian landscapes, were by artist Jan Stephan Kalkar, student of Tiziano Vecelli. Muslim experts have also written anatomy books. For example, the Qanun of Medicine by Ibn Sina in the 10th century explained the anatomy of human bones and how to treat diseases. In addition, there are manuscripts from around the 15th century during the reign of the Mamluks which contain detailed explanations of horse anatomy. Prior to the modern medical era, the principal means of studying the internal structure of the body were the dissection of the corpse, as well as the inspection, palpation, and auscultation of the living. The invention of the microscope then opened up an understanding of the existence of the building blocks of living tissue. Technical advances in the development of achromatic lenses increased the resolving power of microscopes and around 1839, Matthias Jakob Schleiden and Theodor Schwann identified that the cell is the basic organizational unit of all living things. Small structures are studied by passing light through the cell and using a microtome to make slices of tissue thin enough to examine. Staining techniques using artificial dyes are used to help differentiate the different types of tissue. Advances in histology and cytology began in the late 19th century, as advances in surgical techniques made it possible to remove biopsy specimens safely and painlessly.",

Since nearly all the visible objects in the universe are stars, consisting mostly of hydrogen and helium, astronomers, for convenience, use the term \"metal\" to describe all elements heavier than hydrogen and helium. For example, if a nebula is rich in the elements carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and neon it will be called \"metal-rich\" in astrophysical terms, even though the elements are not metals or metals in the chemical sense. This term should not be confused with the general definition of \"metal\", metallic bonds in a chemical sense are impossible in the core of stars, and chemical bonds are only possible in the cold outer shells of class K or M stars. General chemical properties have no meaning or relevance in the core of a star. The metallicity of an astronomical object can give an indication of its age. When the universe was formed, according to the big bang theory, it initially consisted of hydrogen, which then, through primordial nucleosynthesis, produced sizable amounts of helium, tiny amounts of lithium and beryllium, and no other elements. So old stars have lower metallicity than younger stars like the sun. Metallicity is expressed as the \"Fe/H] fraction, which represents the logarithm of the ratio of the abundance of iron in stars to that in the Sun (iron is not the most abundant heavy element, but only one of the elements whose abundance is most easily measured via the visible spectrum .). The formula for the logarithm is expressed as follows: where NFe{\\displaystyle N_{\\mathrm {Fe} }} and NH{\\displaystyle N_{\\mathrm {H} }} are the number of iron and hydrogen atoms per unit volume, respectively.",

        "paragraph": "Anaxagoras is one of the philosophers from the school of pluralism. Another philosopher belonging to this school was Empedocles. Anaxagoras, like Empedocles, taught that the reality of the universe is derived from many principles. Anaxagoras was a contemporary of Empedocles as well as of early atomist philosophers, such as Leucippus and Democritus. Anaxagoras is known to have authored one book in prose. However, only a few fragments of the first part have survived. Anaxagoras (500-428 BC) was born in the city of Clazomenai, Ionia, Asia Minor, around 500 BC. In 480 BC, Anaxagoras left his hometown and settled in Athens. He lived in Athens for about 50 years. Thus Anaxagoras became the first philosopher to work in Athens, which would later become the center of Greek philosophy. In Athens Anaxagoras befriended Pericles, a well-known politician in Athens. In addition, it is also said that Euripides, the famous playwright of Greek literature, was a student of Anaxagoras. When Pericles was old, his enemies succeeded in slandering Anaxagoras with apostasy and Anaxagoras was threatened with death. It seems that Anaxagoras was slandered because he considered the sun and moon not to be gods but purely material things. With Pericles' help, he was released from prison and fled to the city of Lampsacus. Anaxagoras is said to have died there at the age of 72. Anaxagoras, like Empedocles, stated that the basic principles that make up the universe are not single, but they differ in number. Empedocles stated that there are only 4 substances that are the principles of the universe, while Anaxagoras stated that the number of these principles is infinite. These substances he called \"seeds\" (spermata). According to Anaxagoras, every thing, in fact all the realities in the universe, are composed of a mixture which contains all the seeds in a certain amount.",

        "paragraph": "The human senses cannot perceive all the seeds in an object, but only the dominant seeds. For example, if a person sees gold, then he can immediately recognize it as gold, because the dominant seed in the object is the gold seed. However, in reality, in addition to gold seeds, the thing also has copper, silver, iron, etc. seeds. It's just that all those seeds are not dominant so they are not captured by human senses. The argument that Anaxagoras shows is through the human body. In the human body there are various elements, such as flesh, nails, blood, hair, and so on. How can hair and nails grow, when humans do not eat hair or nails? The solution given by Anaxagoras is because in the food there are seeds of hair, nails, meat, and all other elements. If Empedocles states that there are two principles that cause changes from basic substances, namely \"love\" and \"hate\", then Anaxagoras states that there is only one principle that causes changes from those seeds, namely nous. Nous means \"spirit\" or \"ratio\". It is not mixed with the seeds and separated from all things, but becomes the principle that regulates everything. It is still a matter of debate whether the nous he means is material or not, because Anaxagoras said that nous is the most refined and purest element of everything that exists. However, it is clear that Anaxagoras was the first philosopher to establish the independence of spirit or ratio over all substances or matter. Anaxagoras' teaching about the universe is similar to the first philosophers from Ionia, especially Anaximenes. Anaxagoras thinks that the bodies of the universe consist of rocks that glow due to the high speed of the whirlwind that moves them.",

Estimates of the habitable zone around other stars, sometimes referred to as the \"Goldilocks zone\" have coincided with the discovery of hundreds of exoplanets and new insights into extreme habitats. here on Earth, suggest that there may be more habitable places in the universe than was thought until recently. Current studies of the planet Mars by the Curiosity and Opportunity probes are underway to look for evidence of ancient life as well as plains associated with ancient rivers or lakes that may have inhabited it. The search for evidence of habitability, taphonomy (associated with fossils), and organic molecules on the planet Mars is now a major goal of NASA and ESA. Even if extraterrestrial life is never discovered, the interdisciplinary nature of astrobiology, and the cosmic and evolutionary perspectives it brings, could still yield a variety of benefits on Earth. The term was first proposed by the Russian (Soviet) astronomer Gavriil Tikhov in 1953.

Because alternative chemical analogues to some life processes have been created in laboratories, xenobiology is now considered a surviving subject. While astrobiology is an emerging and developing field, the question of whether life exists elsewhere in the universe is a verifiable hypothesis and thus a valid line of scientific inquiry. While once considered outside the mainstream of scientific inquiry, astrobiology has become a formal field of study. Planetary scientist David Grinspoon refers to astrobiology as a field of natural philosophy, which bases speculation on the unknown, on known scientific theories. NASA's interest in exobiology first began with the development of the US Space Program. In 1959, NASA funded its first exobiology project, and in 1960, NASA established the Exobiology Program, which is now one of the four major elements of NASA's current Astrobiology Program. In 1971, NASA funded an extraterrestrial intelligence search (SETI) search for radio frequencies of the electromagnetic spectrum for interstellar communications transmitted by extraterrestrial life outside the Solar System. NASA's Viking mission to Mars, launched in 1976, included three biological experiments designed to search for the metabolism of life now on Mars.

The mission designed specifically to search for present-day life on Mars was the Viking program and the Beagle 2 probe. Viking's results were inconclusive and Beagle 2 failed minutes after landing. A future mission with a strong astrobiology role is the Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter which is designed to study Jupiter's frozen moons \u2014 some of which may have liquid water \u2014 should the mission not be aborted. In late 2008, the Phoenix lander investigated the environment for past and present microbial habitats on Mars, and researched the history of water there.

Meanwhile, NASA is developing the Mars 2020 astrobiological rover and sample depository for later delivery back to Earth. When searching for life on other planets like Earth, a few simplifying assumptions are useful for reducing the size of the astrobiological task. One is the assumption that most life forms in our galaxy are based on carbon chemistry, as are all life forms on Earth. Carbon is famous for the incredibly wide variety of molecules that can be formed around it. Carbon is the fourth most abundant element in the universe and the energy needed to make or break bonds is just at the right level to build molecules that are not only stable, but also reactive. The fact that carbon atoms bond easily with other carbon atoms makes it possible to form very long and complex molecules. The presence of liquid water was an assumed requirement, as it is a common molecule and provides an excellent environment for the formation of complex carbon-based molecules that could eventually lead to the emergence of life. Some researchers posit mixed ammonia-water environments as possible solvents for various other types of hypothetical biochemistry. The third assumption is to focus on planets orbiting stars like the Sun to increase the likelihood of planetary habitability. Very massive stars have relatively short lifetimes, meaning that life may not have time to emerge on planets orbiting them. Stars that are so small give off so little heat and warmth that only planets in very close orbits around them would not freeze and in such close orbits and these planets would be \"locked\" to the star.",

This is important, because red dwarfs are the most numerous stars in the universe. (See Habitability of red dwarf systems). Since Earth is the only planet known to harbor life, there is no clear way of knowing whether this simplification assumption is true or false. Research on communication with extraterrestrial intelligence (CETI) focuses on crafting and deciphering messages that can theoretically be understood by other technological civilizations. Communication efforts by humans include broadcast mathematical languages, pictorial systems such as the Arecibo message and computational approaches to detecting and deciphering 'natural' language communication. The SETI program, for example, uses radio telescopes and optical telescopes to search for intentional signals from extraterrestrial intelligence. While some well-known scientists such as Carl Sagan have advocated sending messages into outer space, scientist Stephen Hawking warns against it, arguing that aliens may attack Earth solely for its resources and then leave. Most astrobiology research related to astronomy falls into the category of exoplanet detection, the hypothesis being that if life arose on Earth, it could also arise on other planets with similar characteristics. To that end, a number of instruments designed to detect Earth-sized exoplanets have been considered, most notably NASA's Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF) and ESA's Darwin program, both of which have been cancelled. NASA launched the Kepler mission in March 2009, and the French Space Agency launched the COROT space mission in 2006. There are also several less ambitious ground-based efforts under way.

It is hoped that once these missions come online, their spectra can be cross-checked with those of this virtual planet for features that might indicate the presence of life.

The first variable, R*, the number of stars, is generally limited to a scale of a few magnitude levels (10n). The second and third variables, fp, star with planets and fe, planet with habitable conditions, are being evaluated for systems around these star systems. Drake originally formulated the equation simply as an item on the agenda for discussion at the Green Bank conference, but some applications of the formula have been taken literally and related to simplistic scientific or pseudoscientific arguments.

It has been suggested that peculiarities of the Solar System (eg, the presence of Jupiter as a protective shield) may have greatly increased the likelihood of intelligent life emerging on our planet. Biology cannot state that a process or phenomenon, by being mathematically possible, must exist forcibly on a celestial object. Biologists define what is speculative and what is not. The discovery of extremophiles, organisms capable of surviving extreme environments, is a core research element for astrobiologists, because such organisms are important for understanding the four frontiers of life on a planetary scale: potential panspermia, forward contamination due to human exploration efforts, human colonization of the planet. , and the exploration of extinct and extant extraterrestrial life. Until the 1970s, life was thought to depend entirely on energy from the Sun. Plants on Earth's surface capture energy from sunlight to photosynthesize sugars from carbon dioxide and water, releasing oxygen in the process which is then consumed by oxygen-responding organisms, passing their energy up the food chain. Even life in the depths of the oceans, where sunlight cannot reach, is thought to obtain its food either from consuming organic detritus that rains down from the surface of the water or from eating animals that do. A planet's ability to support life is thought to depend on its access to sunlight. However, in 1977, during exploratory dives into the Galapagos Rift at the Alvin underwater probe, scientists discovered colonies of giant tubeworms, clams, crustaceans, clams, and various other creatures swarming around underwater volcanic features known as hydrothermal vents. These creatures thrived despite having no access to sunlight, and it was soon discovered that they comprised an entirely independent ecosystem.",

Other life forms that are completely decoupled from energy from sunlight are the green sulfur bacteria which capture geothermal light for anoxyogenic photosynthesis or the bacteria which carry out chemolithoautotrophy based on the radioactive decay of uranium. This chemosynthesis revolutionized the study of biology and astrobiology by revealing that life does not have to depend on the sun, it only needs water and an energy gradient to exist. Biologists have found extremophiles thriving in ice, boiling water, acids, alkalis, nuclear reactor water cores, salt crystals, toxic wastes and in a variety of other extreme habitats previously thought to be inhospitable to life. It breaks new ground in astrobiology by greatly expanding the number of possible extraterrestrial habitats. The characteristics of these organisms, their environment and evolutionary pathways, are considered important components for understanding how life could have evolved elsewhere in the universe. For example, some organisms that are able to withstand exposure to a vacuum and outdoor radiation include the lichen fungi Rhizocarpon geographicum and Xanthoria elegans, the bacteria Bacillus sapensis, Deinococcus radiodurans, Bacillus subtilis, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana (mouse ear watercress), as well as Tardigrada invertebrate animals.

The origin of life, known as abiogenesis, as distinct from the evolution of life, is another ongoing area of \u200b\u200bresearch. Oparin and Haldane postulated that conditions on early Earth were conducive to the formation of organic compounds from inorganic elements and thus to the formation of many of the chemicals common to all forms of life that we see today. The study of this process, known as prebiotic chemistry, has made some progress, but it remains unclear whether life could have formed in this way on Earth. An alternative hypothesis of panspermia is that the first elements of life may have formed on other planets with more favorable conditions (or even in interstellar space, asteroids, etc.) and then been brought to Earth - the panspermia hypothesis. The cosmic dust that pervades the universe contains complex organic compounds (\"amorphous organic solids with mixed aromatic-aliphatic structures\") that can be made naturally, and rapidly by stars. Furthermore, one scientist suggested that these compounds might be related to the development of life on Earth and said that, \"If this is the case, life on Earth might be easier to start because these organic materials could serve as the basic building blocks for life.\" More than 20% of the carbon in the universe can be associated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), a possible starting material for the formation of life.

Astroecology concerns the interactions of life with the environment and resources of outer space, on planets, asteroids and comets. On a larger scale, astroecology concerns the resources for life about stars in galaxies through the cosmological future. Astroecology seeks to measure future life in space, addressing this area of \u200b\u200bastrobiology. Experimental astroecology investigates the soil resources of a planet, based on extraterrestrial materials found in meteorites. The results showed that Mars chondrite material and carbon could support the cultivation of bacteria, algae and plants (asparagus, potato), with high soil fertility. These results support the argument that life can survive on watery asteroids and on similar materials imported to Earth via dust, comets and meteorites, and that the asteroid material could be used as soil for future space colonies. On the largest scale, cosmoecology concerns life in the universe during cosmological epochs. The main sources of energy are probably red giant stars and white and red dwarfs, which sustain life for up to 1020 years. Astroecologists suggest that their mathematical model can measure the amount of potential future life in space, enabling an expansion of biodiversity that could potentially lead to a wider variety of intelligent life forms.

Specializations include cosmochemistry, biochemistry and organic geochemistry. The fossil record provides the oldest known evidence of life on Earth. By examining the fossil evidence, paleontologists can better understand the types of organisms that arose on the ancient Earth. Some regions on Earth, such as the Pilbara in Western Australia and Antarctica's McMurdo Dry Valleys, are also thought to be analogous to geological regions on Mars, and as such, may provide clues as to how to look for past life on Mars. A variety of organic functional groups, consisting of hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and a number of metals, such as iron, magnesium, and zinc, provide for the wide variety of chemical reactions catalyzed by living organisms. In contrast, silicon interacts with only a few other atoms, and large silicon molecules are monotone compared to the combinatorial universe of organic macromolecules. Indeed, it appears that in general terms the basis of life elsewhere would be similar to that on Earth, if not in detail. Although terrestrial life and life that might have arisen independently of Earth are expected to share many similar\u2014if not identical\u2014foundations of life, they are also expected to possess some unique biochemical qualities. Whatever extraterrestrial life forms may emerge, their tendency to change their environment chemically like life on Earth may reveal their presence.

Only two naturally occurring atoms, carbon and silicon, are known to serve as the foundation of molecules large enough to carry biological information. As the structural basis for life, one of the important features of carbon is that, unlike silicon, it can easily engage in the formation of chemical bonds with many other atoms, thereby enabling the chemical flexibility necessary to carry out metabolic reactions and biological propagation. Thought about where life might occur in the Solar System has historically been limited by the understanding that life is ultimately dependent on light and warmth from the Sun and, therefore, confined to planetary surfaces. The four most likely candidates for life in the Solar System are the planet Mars, the Jovian moon Europa, and Saturn's moons Titan and Enceladus. Mars, Enceladus, and Europa are considered potential candidates in the search for life primarily because they may have underground liquid water, a molecule essential to life as we know it for its use as a solvent in cells. Water on Mars has been found frozen in its polar ice caps, and newly carved trenches recently observed on Mars suggest that liquid water may exist, at least temporarily, on the planet's surface. At the low temperatures and low pressures on Mars, liquid water tends to be very salty. As for Europa and Enceladus, huge global oceans of liquid water exist beneath the icy outer layers of these moons. This water may have been warmed to a liquid state by volcanic vents on the ocean floor, but the main source of heat is probably tidal heating.",

Titan has been described as having conditions similar to those of Earth at the start of its formation. On its surface, scientists have discovered the first liquid lake outside Earth, but this lake appears to be composed of ethane and/or methane rather than water. Some scientists suggest that these liquid hydrocarbons might replace water in living cells different from those on Earth. After studying the Cassini data, it was reported in March 2008 that Titan may also have an underground ocean composed of liquid water and ammonia. Measuring the ratio of hydrogen and methane levels on Mars can help determine the possibility of life on Mars. According to scientists, \"...a low H2/CH4 ratio (less than about 40) indicates that life is possible and active.\" Other scientists recently reported methods for detecting hydrogen and methane in the atmospheres of extraterrestrial bodies. The complex organic compounds of life, including uracil, cytosine and thymine, have been formed in the laboratory under extraterrestrial conditions, using starting chemicals such as pyrimidine, which is found in meteorites.

The platypus is the only living representative or monotypic taxon of its family (Ornithorhynchidae) and genus (Ornithorhynchus), although a number of related species also appear in the fossil record. Along with the four species of echidna, the platypus is one of the five extant species of monotremes, mammals that lay eggs rather than give birth to live young. Like other monotremes, it senses prey by means of electrolocation. The platypus is one of the few species of venomous mammals, in which the male platypus has spurs on the back of its legs capable of delivering venom, which can cause severe pain in humans. The unusual appearance of this egg-laying mammal, which has a duck-like bill, biwara tail, and beaver-like feet baffled European naturalists when they first encountered it, and the first scientists to examine the preserved body of a platypus (in 1799) judged it a fake, said it was made of several animals sewn together. The platypus' unique features have made it an important subject in the study of evolutionary biology, and an easily recognized iconic symbol of Australia. The platypus is culturally significant to some Aboriginal Australian tribes, who also used to hunt the animal for food. The platypus appears as a mascot at national events and is featured on the back of the Australian twenty cent coin, the platypus is also the animal emblem of the state of New South Wales.

This species is classified as Critically Endangered by the IUCN, but a November 2020 report recommended that it be upgraded to Endangered under the federal EPBC Act, due to habitat destruction and declining numbers in all Australian states. When the platypus was first discovered by Europeans in 1798, its skin and sketches from it were sent back to England by Captain John Hunter, second Governor of New South Wales. British scientists' initial guess was that the attributes were fake. George Shaw, who made the first description of the animal in the Naturalist's Miscellany in 1799, stated that it was impossible not to doubt its authenticity, and Robert Knox believed that it was probably made by an Asian taxidermist. It was originally thought that someone had sewn a duck's beak onto the body of a biwara-like animal. Shaw even took scissors to his dry skin to check for stitches. The common name \"platypus\" literally means 'flat-footed', derived from the Greek words plat\u00fapous (\u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03c4\u03cd\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2), from plat\u00fas (\u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03c4\u03cd\u03c2: 'broad, wide, flat') and po\u00fas (\u03c0\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2: 'foot'). Shaw originally gave it the name Linnaean Platypus anatinus when he described it, but the genus term was soon discovered to have been used as the genus name for a group of ambrosia wood-boring beetles. Platypus anatinus was later described independently as Ornithorhynchus paradoxus by Johann Blumenbach in 1800 (from a specimen supplied to him by Sir Joseph Banks) and following the rules of nomenclature priority, was then officially recognized as Ornithorhynchus anatinus.",

Early settlers from England called it by many names, such as \"watermole\", \"duckbill\", and \"duckmole\". Sometimes specifically called the \"duck-billed platypus\".

Its hair is water-resistant, and its texture is similar to that of a mole. The platypus uses its tail to store fat reserves (an adaptation also found in animals such as the Tasmanian Devil). The webbed feet are more significant on the forelegs which are folded back when walking on land. The elongated muzzle and lower jaw are covered with soft skin, forming a beak. The nostrils are located on the dorsal surface of the snout, while the eyes and ears are in the depression immediately behind it; this niche is closed when swimming.

Research shows that this is a gradual adaptation to harsh environmental conditions by the few surviving monotreme species, rather than a historical characteristic of monotremes. Young platypuses have three teeth in each of their upper (one premolar and two molars) and lower (three molars) jaws, which are lost either before or shortly after leaving the breeding hole; instead, adult platypuses have highly keratinized pads called ceratodontes, which they use to grind food. The first and third upper and lower cheek teeth of a platypus cub are small, each having one prominent ridge, while the other teeth have two projections. The platypus jaw is structurally different from that of other mammals, with different jaw-opening muscles. In most true mammals, the small sound-conducting bones in the middle ear are fully fused into the skull, rather than located in the jaws as in pre-mammalian synapsids.

When on land, it adopts a knuckle-knuckle gait, to protect the webs between the toes. Although both male and female platypuses are born with a spur on the back of their ankle, only the male's ankle spur produces venom, which consists mostly of defensin-like proteins (DLP), three of which are unique to the platypus. This DLP is produced by the platypus immune system. Defensin function is to cause lysis in bacterial and viral pathogens, but in the platypus, it also forms defensive venom. While it is strong enough to kill smaller animals such as dogs, its venom is not lethal to humans, but the pain it causes is so excruciating that it paralyzes the victim. The swelling develops rapidly around the wound and gradually spreads over the affected limb. Information gleaned from the case history and personal testimony indicates that the pain progresses to hyperalgesia (increased sensitivity to pain) that persists for days or even months. Venom is produced in the male platypus clural gland, which is a kidney-shaped alveolar gland connected by a thin-walled duct to the calcaneal spur on each hind limb. Female platypuses, like echidnas, have rudimentary bud spurs that do not develop (drop off before the end of their first year) and lack functional claral glands.

Similar spurs were found in many groups of ancient mammals, indicating that this is an archaic characteristic for mammals as a whole, and not exclusive to the platypus or other monotremes. Monotremes are the only mammals (other than at least one species of dolphin namely the Guyanese Dolphin) known to have an electroreceptive sense: they find their prey in part by detecting the electric fields generated by muscle contractions. The electroreception of the platypus is the most sensitive of any monotreme. Electroreceptors are located in the rostrocaudal row in the skin of the bill, while mechanoreceptors (those that detect touch) are uniformly distributed throughout the bill. The electrosensory areas of the cerebral cortex lie within the somatosensory areas of touch, and several cortical cells receive input from electroreceptors and mechanoreceptors, suggesting a close relationship between the sense of touch and the sense of electricity. Both electroreceptors and mechanoreceptors in the beak dominate the somatotopic map of the platypus brain, in the same way the human hand dominates the map of Penfield's homunculus. The platypus can determine the direction of an electric source, possibly by comparing the difference in signal strength across layers of electroreceptors. This would explain the characteristic side-to-side movement of its head while hunting. The cortical convergence of electrosensory and tactile inputs suggests a distance-determining mechanism for prey that, when they move, emits electrical signals and mechanical pressure waves. The platypus uses the difference between the arrival times of the two signals to determine the distance. The platypus closes its eyes, ears, and nose whenever it dives, so it doesn't use sight and smell when searching for food. Instead, when it burrows in the riverbed with its bill, its electroreceptors detect tiny electrical currents generated by the muscle contractions of its prey, enabling it to distinguish between animate and inanimate objects, continuously stimulating its mechanoreceptors.",

The electrolocation of monotremes may have evolved to allow these animals to forage in murky waters, and may be related to the loss of their teeth. The extinct Obdurodon was electroreceptive, but unlike the modern platypus, it foraged pelagicly (near sea level). In recent research, it has been suggested that the eyes of the platypus are more similar to those of the Pacific hagfish or Northern Hemisphere lamprey than those of most tetrapods. The platypus' eyes also contain double cones, which most mammals lack. Although the eyes of the platypus are small and not used underwater, several features suggest that sight played an important role in their common ancestor. The surface of the cornea and the adjacent lens surface are flat while the posterior surface of the lens is curved steeply, similar to the eyes of other aquatic mammals such as otters and sea lions. The temporal (ear side) concentration of retinal ganglion cells, which are important for binocular vision, indicates a role in predation, while the accompanying visual acuity is insufficient for such activity. Furthermore, this limited visual acuity is offset by low cortical magnification, small lateral geniculate nucleus, and large optic tectum, suggesting that the midbrain for vision plays a more important role than the visual cortex, as in some rodents. These features indicate that the platypus has adapted to an aquatic and nocturnal lifestyle, developing an electrosensory system at the expense of its visual system; an evolutionary process that paralleled the small number of electroreceptors in the short-beaked echidna, which lives in arid environments, while the long-beaked echidna, which lives in moist environments, is halfway between the two monotremes.",

However, with SA Department of the Environment and Water recovery teams working hard to restore their habitat, there were a number of sightings reported in April 2020.

The low number of platypuses in northern Australia is likely due to predation by crocodiles. The introduction of the red fox in 1845 for hunting may have had an impact on platypus numbers in mainland Australia. Platypuses are generally considered to be nocturnal and crepuscular animals, but some are also active during the day, especially when the sky is overcast. Its habitat crosses rivers and riparian zones which provide food for prey species, and riverbanks where it can dig burrows for resting and nesting. Platypuses can range up to 7 km (4.3 mi), with the male's home range overlapping that of three or four females. The platypus has no exterior ears and spends most of its time in the water looking for food. The platypus is a reliable swimmer who has a very distinctive swimming style. Uniquely among mammals, it propels itself when swimming by alternating paddling motions on its forelimbs; although all four legs of the platypus are webbed, the hind legs (which are attached to the body) do not assist in propulsion, but are used for steering along with the tail. This species is endothermic, maintaining a body temperature of around 32 \u00b0C (90 \u00b0F), lower than that of most mammals, even while foraging for hours in water below 5 \u00b0C (41 \u00b0F).

The platypus is a carnivore: it feeds on annelid worms, insect larvae, freshwater shrimp and crayfish, which it digs with its snout from the bottom of rivers or catches them swimming. The platypus uses cheek pouches to transport its prey to the surface, where it will eat it. The platypus needs to eat about 20% of its own body weight each day, which requires it to spend an average of 12 hours each day looking for food. When the platypus was first discovered by European naturalists, they differed over whether the female lays eggs. This was finally confirmed by William Hay Caldwell's team in 1884. This species has a single breeding season; mating occurs between June and October, with some local variation among different populations throughout their range. Historical observations, tagging and recapture studies, and early investigations of population genetics suggest the possibility of resident and transient groups within the platypus population, and the existence of a polygynous mating system. Females are expected to become sexually mature in their second year, with confirmed breeding still occurring in individuals over nine years of age. Outside of the breeding season, platypuses live in simple earthen burrows, the entrance of which is about 30 cm (12 inches) above the waterline.

The female softens the soil in the burrow with dead, folded, and wet leaves, and she fills the nest at the end of the tunnel with fallen leaves and reeds to serve as bedding material. This material is dragged to the nest by tucking it under its curved tail. The female platypus has a pair of ovaries, but only the left one is functional. The platypus gene is likely an evolutionary link between the mammal XY sex determination system and the bird/reptile ZW because one of the five X chromosomes of the platypus contains the DMRT1 gene, which birds have on their Z chromosome. Platypuses lay one to three (usually two) small, leathery eggs (similar to reptile eggs), about 11 mm (7\u204416 in) in diameter and slightly rounder than bird eggs. The egg develops in the uterus for about 28 days, with only about 10 days of external incubation (as opposed to a chicken egg, which spends about a day in the canal and 21 days outside). After laying eggs, the female will incubate the eggs. The incubation period is divided into three phases. In the first phase, the embryo has no functional organs and depends on the yolk sac for its nourishment. The yolk is absorbed by the developing child. During the second phase, the fingers develop, and in the final phase, the ovary teeth emerge. Most mammalian zygotes undergo holoblastic cleavage, which means that, after fertilization, the ovum splits thanks to the cell dividing into several daughter cells that can be divided. This is in contrast to the older meroblastic division process, which is present in monotreme species such as the platypus, and in non-mammals such as reptiles and birds.",

This condition allows the yolk, which contains the embryo, to exchange wastes and nutrients with the cytoplasm. There is no official term in English for a juvenile platypus, but the term \"platypup\" is used informally, as is \"puggle\". Newly hatched platypuses are vulnerable, blind and hairless, and are nourished by their mother's milk. Despite having mammary glands, platypuses do not have nipples. Instead, milk is secreted through the pores in the skin. The milk collects in an indentation in its stomach, so that its young can drink it. After hatching, the young are suckled for three to four months. During the incubation and weaning periods, initially the mother will leave the burrow only briefly, in search of food. When it does, it constructs a number of thin earthen plugs along the burrow, possibly to protect the young from predators; on its return, it will push against it which will force water out of its hairs and keep the burrow dry. After about five weeks, the mother begins to spend more time away from the chicks, and by about four months, the young will emerge from the burrow. The platypus is born with teeth, but these teeth fall out at a very early age, leaving behind the horny plates it uses to grind food. Early on, understanding of the platypus and other monotremes was minimal, and some of the 19th century myths that developed around them - for example, the notion that monotremes are partial or \"inferior\" reptiles - have survived to this day. In 1947, William King Gregory theorized that placental mammals and marsupials may have split early, and a subsequent branch separated the monotremes and marsupials, but later research and fossil discoveries showed this to be wrong.",

Molecular clocks and fossil dating show the platypus split from the echidna around 19-48 million years ago. The oldest fossils of modern platypuses found date to about 100,000 years ago, during the Quaternary period. The extinct monotremes Teinolophos and Steropodon were once thought to be closely related to the modern platypus, but are now considered to be more basal taxa. A Steropodon fossil was discovered in New South Wales and consisted of a mandibular bone with three opalized molars (whereas the adult contemporary platypus is toothless). The molars were initially thought to be tribosphenic, which supports a variation on Gregory's theory, but later research showed that, despite having three molars, they evolved in a separate process. This fossil is estimated to be around 110 million years old, making it the oldest mammal fossil found in Australia. Unlike modern platypuses (and echidnas), Teinolophos lacked a beak. Monotrematum sudamericanum, another fossil species related to the platypus, has been found in Argentina, indicating that monotremes were present on the Gondwana supercontinent when the continents of South America and Australia joined via Antarctica (until about 167 million years ago). A fossilized tooth of a species of giant platypus, Obdurodon tharalkooschild, dated 5-15 million years ago. Judging from its teeth, this animal is 1.3 meters long, making it the largest platypus ever recorded. Because of the early divergence from therian mammals and the low number of extant monotreme species, the platypus is a frequent subject of research in evolutionary biology. In 2004, researchers at the Australian National University found that the platypus has ten sex chromosomes, compared to the two (XY) chromosomes in most other mammals.",

Although the platypus does not have the mammalian sex-determining gene SRY, a study found that the mechanism for determining the sex of the platypus is the AMH gene on the oldest Y chromosome. A draft version of the platypus genome sequence was published in the journal Nature on May 8, 2008, showing the presence of both reptile and mammalian elements, as well as two genes previously found only in birds, amphibians, and fish. More than 80% of the platypus genes are common in other mammals whose genomes have been sequenced. The most recent platypus genome, which is the most complete on record, was published in 2021, along with the short-beaked echidna genome. Despite the disappearance of the platypus from the state of South Australia, it occupies the same general distribution as before the arrival of Europeans to Australia. However, there are documented local changes and fragmentation of distribution due to modification of their habitat by humans. The numbers are historically uncertain and current numbers are difficult to measure, but estimates are that they are on the decline. Reported in 1998 sightings are still considered common in most of its current range. The species was heavily hunted for its skin until the early 20th century and, although protected throughout Australia since 1905, it remained at risk of drowning in inland fishing nets until around 1950.

Reduced water flow and water levels due to excessive drought and water extraction for industrial, agricultural and household supply purposes are also considered a threat. The IUCN listed the platypus on the Red List as \"Near Threatened\" as assessed in 2016, when it was estimated that their numbers had fallen by an average of around 30 percent since European settlement. The platypus is listed as endangered in South Australia, but is not covered under the federal EPBC Act. Researchers have worried for years that the decline in the platypus population is greater than assumed. In January 2020, researchers from the University of New South Wales presented evidence that the platypus was at risk of extinction, due to a combination of water resource extraction, land clearing, climate change and severe drought.

The largest population decline occurred in New South Wales, particularly in the Murray-Darling Basin. Platypuses commonly suffer from several diseases in the wild; however, in 2008 there was concern in Tasmania about the potential impact of disease caused by the fungus Mucor amphibiorum. This disease (called mucormycosis) affects only the Tasmanian platypus, and has never been seen in platypuses on the Australian mainland. Affected platypuses may develop skin lesions or ulcers on various parts of their bodies, including their backs, tails, and legs. Mucormycosis can kill platypuses, death occurs as a result of secondary infection and by affecting the animal's ability to maintain body temperature and forage efficiently. The Biodiversity Conservation Branch of the Department of Primary Industries and Aquatic Services collaborated with NRM north and University of Tasmania researchers to determine the impact of this disease on the Tasmanian platypus, as well as the mechanisms of transmission and spread of the disease.

The main goal of thermochemistry is the establishment of criteria for determining the likelihood or spontaneity of the required transformation.

Most properties in thermochemistry develop from the application of the I law of thermodynamics, the law of the 'conservation' of energy, to functions of internal energy, enthalpy, entropy and Gibbs free energy. Energy is the ability to do work. Every object has energy. Energy possessed by objects can be divided into kinetic energy and potential energy. Kinetic energy is the energy possessed by moving objects. Examples of energy in the wind, waterfalls, and rotating fans. Potential energy is the energy that an object has due to its state or position. Examples are gravitational potential energy and springs. Heat is energy that is transferred from one object to another due to a temperature difference. The unit for heat is the same as the unit for energy, namely the Joule. Sometimes the units used are calories or kilocalories. The heat of reaction is the heat that accompanies a chemical reaction. The system is everything that is the center of attention. The system is the part whose energy changes are being observed. For example, in observing the process of dissolving table salt in water, table salt and water are a system. The environment is part outside the system. For example, in the process of dissolving table salt, apart from table salt and water, it is the environment, for example the air around it.

After thermal activation and fluorescence enhancement through strong absorption, sometimes weak compounds may fluoresce. These types of compounds are vanillic acid and homovanillic acid. Heteroatom compounds have a high sensitivity to thermal activation compared to pure hydrocarbon compounds. Types of heteroatom compounds include nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, or phosphorus. Changes in excitation and emission waves are affected by changes in pH. In addition, thermal activation is also used to detect catecholamines, fruit acids, and some carbohydrates. Heating the thin layer chromatography plate also provides free reagents to detect certain chemicals. This function occurs on the amino bonding plate after swelling to a minimum temperature of 150-220 oC. Thermochemistry has been applied in the production of bioethanol using lignocellulosic biomass as raw material. Ethanol is produced from mixing carbon monoxide gas and two hydrogen atoms. The exothermic reaction was produced at a pressure of 200 bar with the help of a metal catalyst with a temperature of 300 oC.

The same thing happened to glass rubbed with silk, the infection of which made other objects affixed to it charged with \"glassyness\" or vitrious. 1733, Francois du Fay discovered the fact that in nature there are only two types of charges, namely resinous and vitrious charges, and two objects with the same charge will repel and vice versa two objects will attract if the charges are different. Then Benjamin Franklin (1706) \u20131790) discovered the fact that the two types of charge are resinious and vitrious when combined they cancel each other out as with positive and negative numbers. Since then resinious charge has been called a negative electric charge and vitrious has been called a positive electric charge. Continuing Michelson and Carlisle's experiments on electrolysis, Michael Faraday (1791\u20131867) in 1883 proposed the quantization of electric charge into charge units, which was later by Stoney in 1874, which was reinforced by J.J. Thomson in 1897, hypothesized the existence of electric charge-carrying particles which were then called electrons. As a resin, electrons are said to produce a negative electric charge, so the electrons will also be negatively charged. Even though J.C. Maxwell (1831-1879) managed to combine all electrical laws and formulas in the form of four equations which later became known as Maxwell's equations so that all electrical phenomena can always be explained based on or translated from the four equations, in essence the four equations can be combined to become or can be translated from Coulomb's law:\u2033F\u2033=kq1.q2r2{\\displaystyle ''F''=k{\\dfrac {q1.q2}{r^{2}}}}which states that the force between two electric charges q1 and q2 will proportional to the amount of each electric charge and inversely proportional to the square of the distance (r) between the two electric charges, and depending on the medium in which the two charges are located, which in its formulation is determined by a medium constant k.

Simply put, electrostatic energy can be generated by rubbing two insulators. The electrostatic forces that arise can attract pieces of paper or hairs to stand on end. Electrostatic therapy is a therapy that can create a balanced pressure of ions in the body, especially ionic substances (ions of potassium, sodium, magnesium, calcium, etc.) in the body which will make the body more relaxed.

Related to the full material is in Biolistrik. What is meant by capacitance is a measure of capacity, namely the ability to accommodate an electric charge. If a conductor is charged with an electric charge, it will have an electric field on its surface, but the electric charge in it is not pushed out and released from the conductor because the electrostatic field force is balanced by the attractive force of the opposite electric charge coming from the atoms of the conductor itself. However, if there is too much electric charge, the electric field generated will become strong so that the attraction of the conductor atoms is no longer able to overcome the repulsive force of the conductor. As a result, some of the electric charge that is loaded on it is released again because the conductor is unable to accommodate further electric charges. charged electric charge. To formulate concretely, we first study the properties of a conductor which is related to the electric field strength on its surface caused by the electric charge present on it. In the extreme, for the sake of simplicity we mean by a conductor a material that conducts electricity perfectly; which means that the electric charge loaded on it will be free to move without the slightest obstacle. With this definition, the conductor has the following properties: This can easily be explained based on the repulsive force between the charged electric charges so that they are as far away from each other as possible, but have not yet been released from the surface of the conductor.",

So in a state of equilibrium the electric field component in the horizontal direction is zero, which means that the electric field on the surface of the conductor must be perpendicular to the surface. By applying the Gauss theorem with integration that includes the surface just below the surface of the conductor as described in Figure 2.1. part c the integral value is zero because it has no electrical charge at all considering that all the charged electric charges are on the surface of the conductor. If inside the conductor there was a distribution of electric field directions, of course the direction would either all go out or all go to the surface, so that the integral value is not equal to zero. So a zero integral value must mean that the electric field strength is zero i.e. anywhere in the conductor. Since there is no electric charge inside the conductor, no work is required to transfer electricity from point A to point B in the conductor, which means that the electric potential at A is the same as that at B and no work is required to move the electric charge anywhere on the surface of the conductor. to another point which is also on the surface of the conductor because the direction of the electric field on the surface of the conductor is perpendicular to the surface. So the electric potential at all points on the surface of the conductor is the same and is also the same as that inside the conductor. In other words, a conductor is an equipotential object; that is, the electric potential is the same everywhere inside and on the surface of the conductor. With the help of Figure 2.1 part e we observe that by applying Gauss's theorem with integration including the area between conductor cavities inside the conductor, the value of the integral must equal zero because the electric field strength in the conductor is everywhere zero, which means that the area the integration does not include an electric charge, which means that there is also no electric charge on the surface of the cavity.",

The term is often associated with engineering education, such as at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (founded in 1861). The term technology became prominent in the 20th century along with the Second Industrial Revolution. The notion of technology changed at the beginning of the 20th century when American social scientists, started by Thorstein Veblen, translated ideas from the German concept Technik into technology. In German and other European languages, a distinction existed between Technik and Technologie which at that time was nil in English, because the two terms were usually translated as technology. In the 1930s, technology did not only refer to the 'study' of industrial arts, but also to the industrial arts themselves. In 1937, an American sociologist, Read Bain, wrote that technology includes all tools, machines, utensils, weapons, instruments, housing, clothing, communicating and transporting devices and the skills by which we produce and use them (\"technology includes all tools , machines, apparatus, tools, weapons, housing, clothing, transport/transportation and communicating devices, and the skills that enable us to produce them\"). The definition proposed by Bain is still commonly used by scholars to this day, especially social scientists. But there is also a definition that is just as prominent, namely that of technology as applied science, especially among scientists, and engineers, although most social scientists who study technology reject this definition. More recently, scholars have borrowed from European philosophers, technique, to extend the meaning of technology to various forms of instrumental reasoning, as in Foucault's work on techniques de soi, which is translated as technologies of the self or self-technology.",

This newfound knowledge can then be used by engineers and technicians to invent new tools and machines, such as semiconductors, computers and other advanced forms of technology. In this light, scientists and engineers can both be viewed as \"technology\", the three domains can often be viewed as one for research and reference purposes. The exact relationship between science and technology in particular has been debated by scientists, historians and policy makers in the late 20th century, in part because debates can inform the costs of basic science and applied science. In the wake after World War II, for example in the United States there was a widespread notion that technology was simply \"applied science\" and that to fund basic science was to reap the technological rewards in time. This philosophical articulation can be found explicitly in Vannevar Bush's treatise on postwar science policy, \"Science\u2014The Endless Frontier\". New products, new industries and more jobs require additional, continuous knowledge of natural laws. This essential new knowledge can only be obtained through basic scientific research. However, in the late 1960s, this view emerged against the backdrop of direct attacks which led to various initiatives to fund science for specific purposes (these initiatives were rejected by the scientific community). The issue is still being debated although most analysts reject the model that technology is simply the result of scientific research. Technological developments take place in an evolutionary manner. Since the time of Ancient Rome thought, and cultural output has been seen to be oriented towards the field of technology. Etymologically, the root of the word technology is \"techne\" which means a series of rational principles or methods related to the manufacture of an object, or certain skills, or knowledge of principles or methods, and art. The term technology itself was first used by Philips in in 1706 in a book entitled Technology: A Description Of The Arts, Especially The Mechanical (Technology: A Description Of The Arts, Especially The Mechanical).",

Medieval technology used simple machines (such as levers, bolts and pulleys) combined to form more complex tools, such as wheelbarrows, windmills and wall clocks. During the Renaissance era, a printing press was invented which allowed the documentation of knowledge to be broader and technology was increasingly related to science. Technological advances in this century have made it possible to have a more stable supply of food and goods. Beginning in England in the 18th century, the Industrial Revolution was a period of discovery of new technologies, particularly in agriculture, manufacturing, mining, metallurgy, and transportation driven by the invention of steam power. Technology ascended to the next stage through the second industrial revolution with the invention of electricity and its derivatives such as electric motors, incandescent lamps, etc. Advances in science and the discovery of new concepts made aviation possible and advances in medicine, chemistry, physics and engineering. It also allows the construction of skyscrapers and urban areas whose residents depend on motorbikes as transportation. Communication also developed with the invention of the telegraph, telephone, radio and television. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, airplanes and automobiles were invented in the field of transportation. In the 20th century, more and more new discoveries. In physics, the discovery of nuclear fission led to the discovery of nuclear weapons and nuclear power. Computers were also invented and reduced in size thanks to transistors and integrated circuits. Information technology led to the invention of the Internet, so that today is known as the Information Age.

In quantum mechanics, the double slit experiment conducted by Thomas Young shows the inseparable nature of light as a wave and a particle. A coherent light source that illuminates an obstruction with two slits will form an interference pattern of light and dark bands of light in the field of view, however, in the field of view, light is found to be absorbed as discrete particles called photons. The bright band of light in the field of view occurs due to constructive interference, when a wave crest (en:crest) interferes with other wave crests and forms maxima. Dark bands of light occur when the crest of the wave interferes with the wave bed (en: trough) and becomes a minima. Constructive interference occurs when: where This equation is an approximation for a particular condition.

Each hole in the disc is positioned with the same angle difference so that in each rotation the disc can transmit light through each hole until it hits the light-sensitive selenium layer which produces an electric pulse. Along with positioning the focused image at the center of the disc, each hole will scan each horizontal \"slice\" of the entire image. Nipkow's device did not really become practical until advances in amplifier tube technology. However, the device could only transmit a \"halftone\" image \u2014 due to positioned holes of varying sizes \u2014 over telegraph or telephone cables. A later design used a rotating mirror-drum scanner as the image recorder and a cathode ray tube (CRT) as the display device. In 1907, a Russian scientist, Boris Rosing, became the first inventor to use a CRT in the receiving device of an experimental television system. He used a \"mirror-drum\" scanner to send a simple geometric image to the CRT. However, it is still not possible to record moving images, due to the low sensitivity of the selenium detector. Scottish inventor John Logie Baird successfully demonstrated the method of transmitting moving images in London in 1925, followed by monochrome moving images in 1926.",

This demonstration by Baird has been generally accepted by the world as the first television demonstration, even though mechanical television is no longer used. In 1927, Baird also invented the world's first video recording system, namely \"Phonovision\". By modulating the output signal of his TV camera into the audio range, he was able to record the signal on a 10-inch (25 cm) audio disc using common audio recording technology. Few of Baird's \"Phonovision\" recordings survive and these were decoded and processed into viewable images in the 1990s using digital signal-processing technology. In 1926, a Hungarian engineer, K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Tihanyi, designed a television system with a fully electronic scanning and display device, and using the principle of \"charge storage\" in the scan tube (or \"camera\"). In 1927, a Russian inventor, L\u00e9on Theremin, developed a mirror-drum television system that used a \"intertwined video\" system to produce a picture resolution of 100 lines. That same year, Herbert E. Ives of Bell Labs succeeded in transmitting moving images from a 50-window disc producing 16 images per minute over a wired medium from Washington, D.C. to New York City, as well as via radio waves from Whippany, New Jersey. Ives uses a 24 x 30 inch (60 x 75 cm) display screen. The subjects of the recordings included one of the then American Secretary of Commerce, Herbert Hoover. In the same year, Philo Farnsworth succeeded in making the world's first television system with electronic scanning on both display devices and pickups, where this invention was first demonstrated in front of the press on September 1, 1928.",

In the early days of television, electromechanical television boxes were commercially sold from 1928 to 1934 in England, the United States, and Russia. The first commercial television was sold by Baird in the United Kingdom in 1928 in the form of a radio receiver coupled with components such as a neon tube behind the Nipkow disc which produced a reddish image the size of a postage stamp which could be enlarged using a magnifying lens. Baird's \"Televisor\" can also be used without a radio. Televisors sold in 1930\u20131933 were the first mass marketing of television. Approximately 1,000 units of Televisor were sold. The first commercial electronic television box with cathode ray tube was produced by Telefunken in Germany in 1934, followed by other electronics manufacturers in France (1936), United Kingdom (1936) and United States (1938). In 1936, K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Tihanyi explained the principle of plasma television, the first flat panel system. In 1938 America, a 3-inch (7.6 cm) television retailed for $125 (equivalent to $1,863 in 2007.) The cheapest model for a 12-inch (30 cm) television was $445 (equivalent to $6,633 as of 2007) . Approximately 19,000 electronic television units were produced in Britain, 1,600 units in Germany, and 8,000 units in America, before the War Production Board was forced to stop TV production in April 1942 due to the outbreak of World War II. Use of TVs in the United States increased again after World War II when TV production was permitted again in August 1945. After the war, the number of TV owners in America increased by about 0.5% in 1946, then up 55.7% in 1954, and rose to 90% in 1962.",

In general, the workings of a TV box began with an antenna that received radio frequency (RF) input in the form of a VHF and UHF whose work is regulated by the tuner and wave finder, then the signal is processed and separated between image and sound, while the image is processed by the cathode tube and forwarded to the screen, the sound signal is processed to be split into stereo, to then be fed to the final amplifier and speakers. Television image output devices currently use various display technologies such as CRT, LCD, Plasma, DLP, and OLED. As for additional input terminals for other hardware devices, the television unit is also equipped with input terminals for DVD players, video game consoles and personal listening devices. Other input terminals that are also frequently encountered include RCA, mini-DIN, HDMI, SCART, and D-terminal. There is also an input for recording sound and pictures from TV shows. Some luxury TV units are equipped with an Ethernet port to receive data from the Internet, such as stock values, weather or news. All TV units manufactured since the early 1980s are also equipped with an infrared remote control to control broadcast channels, sound, brightness, contrast, color, etc. There are various ways to broadcast TV content that can be broadcast publicly. Once produced, the next step is to market and sell it to any market that wants to buy it.

For subscription TV channels, in order to protect revenue, they usually encrypt the signal to ensure that only those who have subscribed can do the decryption and view their broadcasts. Meanwhile, TV channels without encryption are referred to as free broadcasts (en: free to air / FTA). Wide broadcasting makes television a very attractive medium for advertisers. Most networks and television stations sell some portion of the broadcast time to advertisers or sponsors to finance their broadcast network. The advertising price for each network varies for each block of time, depending on the rating (show hits) owned by a program which is calculated through a survey every day. In some countries, television services are financed by means of a television license or some form of excise which makes advertising's role in financing little or nonexistent. For example, some TV channels that use little or no advertising are ABC (Australia), NHK (Japan), BBC (UK), etc. The British BBC does not broadcast advertisements on its UK channel, but they are financed by an annual license paid by all viewers. These license fees are set by the government, but the BBC is not answerable to the government or controlled by the government. The two main channels of the BBC network are watched by approximately 90% of Britons weekly and account for 27% of total viewing, although 85% of households receive multiple channels, with 42% receiving around 200 free channels via satellite and 43% receiving more of 30 channels through the Freeview service.

ABC receives funding from the Australian Government every three years. In the 2008/09 Australian Budget, ABC received $822.67 million. The funds are used for the entire operation of the ABC Television Network, including radio, online, and International Productions. The ABC network also benefits from ABC Shop stores across Australia. Although funded by the Australian Government, the ABC's editorial independence is guaranteed under law. In France and Ireland, government-funded channels can still broadcast advertising, but all those who own a TV must pay an annual excise tax (la redevance audiovisuelle). In Japan, the NHK Network is financed by a licensing fee (known in Japan as a reception tax (\u53d7\u4fe1\u6599, Jushinry\u014d)). There is a law that stipulates that every television that receives NHK broadcasts is required to pay taxes. The tax rate is fixed, with discounts for office workers and school students, including a general discount for residents of the Okinawa Administrative Region. Some TV channels are paid for by subscribers, therefore the broadcast signal will be broadcast with encryption to ensure that only paying subscribers can enjoy the TV Station's broadcast.

In comparison, research shows that television shows without educational intent\u2014such as cartoons in general\u2014are not associated with improved language skills. After adolescence, children who used to watch Sesame Street at preschool age achieved higher grades, read more books, and were more motivated to achieve achievements compared to teenagers who at preschool age did not watch the program. Through television, children and youth can also learn about non-violence, empathy, tolerance for people of other races or ethnicities, and respect for elders. Educational information can also be included in programs that are popular for teenagers, for example education about contraception which was successfully carried out through an episode of the United States television series, Friends.

If there is a television in the child's room, the risk of the child being overweight and the possibility of the child smoking increases, the child becomes less able to read and engage in other hobbies, and the child's sleep time decreases. In 2001, the American Academy of Pediatricians recommended a number of things to address the potential negative effects of television on children and adolescents, including removing television from the child's room, avoiding television viewing by children under 2 years of age, and encouraging parents to accompany their children to watch television and monitor television programs watched by children so that they are informative, educational, and contain no violence.",

The difference between bolts and screws is often misunderstood. There are some practical differences between the two, but most of the differences overlap between bolts and screws. The defining difference, according to Machinery's Handbook, is their purpose. Bolts are used for non-threaded assembly of two components, with the help of nuts. Contrasting screws are used with components, at least one of which has its own internal thread, which can even be formed by the mounting screw itself. Many threaded fasteners can be described as screws or bolts, depending on how they are used. Bolts are often used to make a locked connection. This locked connection is a combination of a nut applying axial clamping forces and a bolt rod acting as a fixing rod, securing the joint against side shear forces. For this reason, many bolts have a plain, non-threaded stem (called a long shank) because this shape makes for a better and stronger fixing rod. The presence of a non-threaded rod is often related to the characteristics of the bolt versus screw, but this non-threaded rod relates to its use, not its definition. The length of the handle must be chosen carefully, approximately the same length as the thickness of the material, and each ring, locked together. Too short a place where the load lock rod slides into the threads can cause swivel wear in the bore. Too long prevents the nut from being tightened properly. No more than two turns of thread in the hole. When a fastener forms its own thread in the component to which it is fastened, the fastener is called a screw. This is so obvious that when the thread is tapered (as with traditional wood screws), the use of nuts is discouraged, or when sheet metal screws or other thread forming screws are used.",

        "paragraph": "The testes are the male sex glands in animals and humans. Humans (men) have two testicles covered with a scrotum. In mammals, the testes lie outside the body, are connected to the spermatic cord and are located in the scrotum. This is consistent with the fact that the process of spermatogenesis in mammals will be more efficient at lower temperatures than body temperature (< 37\u00b0C). In the spermatic cord there is a cremaster muscle which, when contracted, lifts the testes closer to the body. If the temperature of the testicles is lowered, the cremaster muscles will relax and the testicles will move away from the body. This phenomenon is known as the cremaster reflex. Animals other than mammals do not have testes on the outside. Birds, which have a high body temperature, have testicles inside their bodies. According to the theory of experts, they use their air sacs to maintain the optimal temperature of the testes, but in subsequent studies it was stated that the testes of birds function well at body temperature. Archived 2021-04-07 at the Wayback Machine. During puberty, the testes develop to start spermatogenesis. Testicular size depends on sperm production (amount of spermatogenesis), interstitial fluid, and fluid production from the Sertoli cells. In general, the two testicles are not the same size. One may be located lower than the other. This is due to differences in the anatomical structure of the blood vessels in the left and right testicles. The testes play a role in the reproductive system and the endocrine system. Function of the testicles: The work of the testes is under the control of gonadotropic hormones from the anterior pituitary gland: The testes are covered by a fibrous layer called the tunica albuginea. Inside the testes there are many channels called seminiferous tubules. These tubules are filled with layers of sperm cells that have or are developing.

The shape is distinctive and easy to distinguish from other sharp weapons because it is asymmetrical at the base which is widened, often the blade is winding, and many of them have damascene, that is, you can see the bright metal coating fibers on the blades. In the past, keris served as a weapon in duels or wars, as well as a complementary object for offerings. In today's use, kerises are more of an accessory object (ageman) in clothing, have a number of cultural symbols, or become a collection item that is valued from an aesthetic point of view. The keris has been registered and recognized by UNESCO as a World Cultural Heritage Intangible Human originating from Indonesia since 2005. The origins of the keris have not been fully explained because there are no written sources that are descriptive about it from before the 15th century, even though the mention of the term \"keris\" has been listed on inscriptions from the 9th century AD. However, it is thought that the origin of the mention of the word \"keris\" is a Javanese abbreviation of \"Mlungker-mlungker kang bisa ngiris\", in Javanese means \"(the words sinengker, karana, and aris). Sinengker or sengkeran has the meaning of confinement, karaname has the meaning of running, and aris means without suloyo.\" Scientific studies on the development of keris forms are mostly based on the analysis of figures in temple reliefs or statues.

Several daggers found from the Dongson culture bear similarities to the Buda keris and offering keris. The offering keris has a metal handle which is attached to the keris blade. There are two types of basic metals used in making keris, namely ferrous metal and prestige metal, while the keris is made of steel. To make it light, the Masters always combine this basic material with other metals. Modern keris (n\u00e8m-n\u00e8man, made since the 20th century) usually use nickel prestige metal. Good old keris (ancient keris) have the prestige of metal from meteorites which are known to have a high content of titanium, in addition to nickel, cobalt, silver, tin, chromium, antimony and copper. The famous meteorite is the Prambanan meteorite, which fell in the 19th century at the Prambanan temple complex. The making of keris varies from one master to another master, but there are procedures that are usually similar. The following is a brief process according to one library. The iron blade as the base material is washed or heated until it glows and then forged repeatedly to remove impurities (eg carbon and various oxides).

The tip of the kodhokan is then made slightly elongated to be cut and made into marijuana. The next stage is forming the pesi, bengkek (gandhik candidates), and finally forming the blade whether it is curved or straight. Making luk is done by heating. The next stage is making the ornaments (ricikan) by working on certain parts using a file, grinder, and drill, according to the dhapur of the keris to be made. Silak waja is done by filing the blade to see the prestige that is formed. Ganja is made following the base of the blade. The size of the hole is adjusted to the diameter of the pesi. The final stage, namely gilding, is done so that the metal of the keris becomes steel. This process is not carried out on the Philippine keris. Gilding (\"aging metal\") is done by immersing the blade in a mixture of sulfur, salt, and lime juice (called kamalan). Gilding can also be done by burning the keris and then dipping it in a liquid (water, salt water, or coconut oil, depending on the experience of the master who makes it). The gilding action must be done carefully because if it is wrong it can cause the keris blade to crack. In addition to the usual gilding methods as above, in gilding the Keris, it is also known as Sepuh Jilat, namely when the hot metal of the Keris is taken and licked with the tongue, Sepuh Akep, when the hot metal of the Keris is taken and sucked with the lips several times, and Sepuh Saru, when the metal of the Keris is red-hot. taken and clamped with the female genitalia (vagina).

The style of making keris is reflected in the concept of tough, which is usually associated with historical and geographical periodization, as well as the master who made it.",

The handle of the Sulawesi keris depicts a seabird. This is a symbol of some of the professions of the people of Sulawesi who are sailors, while birds are the world's symbol of safety. Like the bird's head motif used on the Riau Lingga keris, and for other areas as centers for the development of tosan aji such as Aceh, Bangkinang (Riau), Palembang, Sambas, Kutai, Bugis, Luwu, Java, Madura and Sulu, the keris has carvings and different symbols. In addition, the materials used also come from various materials such as ivory, bone, metal, and the most common is wood. For the handle of the Javanese keris, in general it consists of sirah wingking (back of the head), jiling, cigir, shallow, bathuk (front of the head), weteng and bungkul. The sheath, or sheath of the keris (Banjar: kumpang), is a component of the keris which has a specific function, especially in the social life of the Javanese people, not least because it is this part that can be seen directly. The warangka were originally made of wood (the most common being teak, sandalwood, timoho, and yellow). In line with the development of the times, the function of wrangka is added as a reflection of the social status of its users. The top or ladrang-gayaman is often replaced with ivory. Broadly speaking there are two forms of sheath, namely the type of sheath ladrang which consists of the parts: angkup, lata, beard, gandek, godong (shaped like leaves), axle, ri and cangkring. And the other type is the wrangka gayaman (gandon) type, which has almost the same parts as the ladrang wrangka, but there is no angkup, godong, and gandek.",

Wrangka ladrang is used for official ceremonies, such as going to the king, other official palace events (coronation, appointment of royal officials, marriage, etc.) with the purpose of honor. The procedure for using it is to slip the axle of the dagger in the fold of the belt (stagen) on the back waist (including as a consideration for the king's safety). While the gayaman frame is used for daily needs, and the dagger is placed on the front (near the waist) or on the back (back waist). In war, what is used is the gayaman-style dagger, the consideration is from a practical and simple side, because the gayaman-style frame allows for quick and easy movement, because its shape is simpler. Ladrang and gayaman are frame patterns, and the main part according to the frame's function is the long lower part (as long as the blade of the dagger) which is called the axle or antupan, then the axle's function is to wrap the blade (blade) and is usually made of wood (considered for does not damage the blade made of mixed metal). Because the function of the axle is to wrap, so the function of beauty is not prioritized, then to beautify it will be coated like a cylinder-casing called pendok. The pendok part (casing layer) is usually carved very beautifully, made of brass, suasa (a mixture of copper and gold), silver, gold. For areas outside of Java (among the kings of Bugis, Goa, Palembang, Riau, Bali) the huts are made of gold, accompanied by additional decorations such as embroidered ropes made of gold and flowers sprinkled with diamonds. For Javanese keris, according to the shape of the pendok there are three types, namely (1) bunton pendok in the shape of a flat casing without a split on the side, (2) blewah pendok (blengah) split lengthwise up to one of the ends so that the axle part will be visible, and (3) topengan pendok whose part is only located in the middle.",

The wilah consists of certain parts that are not the same for each wilah, which are usually called kitchens, or the naming of the various forms on the wilah (there are dozens of kitchen forms). For example, you can mention the kitchen of tall mayang, jaka lola, pinarak, jamang murub, bungkul, kebo tedan, pudak sitegal, etc. At the base of the wilahan there is a pesi, which is the lower end of a keris or keris stalk.

This pesi is between 5\u00a0cm to 7\u00a0cm, with a cross section of about 5 mm to 10\u00a0mm, the shape is elliptical like a pencil. In East Java it is called paksi, in Riau it is called puting, while for Sarawak, Brunei and Malaysia it is called punting. At the base (base of the keris) or the lower part of a keris is called cannabis (for the Malay peninsula area it is called aring). In the middle there is a pesi (round) hole just for inserting pesi, so that the wilah and cannabis parts are inseparable. Tosan aji cultural observers said that the unity symbolizes the unity of the phallus and yoni, where the marijuana represents the yoni symbol while the pesi represents the phallus. At first glance this cannabis has the shape of a lizard, the front part is called sirah gecko, the neck part is called gulu meled, the stomach part is called wetengan and the tail is called sebit ron.

In terms of Javanese keris, the style of the keris according to time and place is termed tough. Tangguh can also be interpreted as \"approximate\", meaning that it is estimated that a keris follows the style of a certain era or place. The \"suspension\" of kerises is generally done for heirloom kerises, although new kerises can also be made according to a certain limit, depending on the wishes of the keris owner or owner. Tangguh keris is not absolute because the descriptions of each tough can overlap. In addition, the old literature does not have an agreement regarding masters who are included in a program. This is due to the oral tradition that before the 20th century was used in padhuwungan science. Although tough is not synonymous with age, the oldest Javanese keris that can be found today is Buda's tough (or Buda's keris). The oldest heirloom modern kerises are considered to be from Tangguh Pajajaran, from the period when parts of Central Java were still under the influence of the Galuh Kingdom. The youngest heirloom keris is from the reign of Pakubuwana X (ends 1939). Furthermore, the quality of keris making continued to decline, even in Surakarta in the 1940s not a single keris maker survived. The revival of the keris craft art in Surakarta began in 1970, initiated by K.R.T. Hardjonagoro (Go Tik Swan) and supported by Sudiono Humardani, through the Bawa Rasa Tosan Aji association. Gradually the keris craftsmanship revived and finally keris knowledge also became a study program at the Surakarta Indonesian Art College (now ISI Surakarta).

        "paragraph": "Human immunodeficiency virus (English: human immunodeficiency virus; often abbreviated as HIV) are two species of lentivirus that cause AIDS. This virus attacks humans and attacks the immune system, so the body becomes weak in fighting infection. If this virus continues to attack the body, our body's defense system will get weaker. Without treatment, a person with HIV can live for 9-11 years after infection, depending on the type. In other words, the presence of this virus in the body will cause a decrease in the immune system. Transmission of the HIV virus can be through the distribution of semen (reproduction), blood, vaginal fluids, and breast milk. HIV works by killing important cells needed by humans, one of which is helper T cells, macrophages, dendritic cells. In 2014, the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) gave Indonesia a red report card regarding HIV/AIDS prevention. New patients increased by 47 percent since 2005. Deaths from AIDS in Indonesia are still high, because only 8 percent of people living with HIV AIDS (PLWHA) are receiving antiretroviral drug (ARV) treatment. Indonesia is the third country in the world that has the most HIV sufferers, namely 640,000 people, after China and India, because these three countries have a large population. It's just that the prevalence in Indonesia is only 0.43 percent or still below the epidemic level of one percent. In 1983, Jean Claude Chermann and Fran\u00e7oise Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi from France succeeded in isolating HIV for the first time from a patient with lymphadenopathy syndrome. At first, the virus was called ALV (lymphadenopathy-associated virus). Together with Luc Montagnier, they proved that the virus is the cause of AIDS. In early 1984, Robert Gallo from the United States also researched the virus that causes AIDS, called HTLV-III.",

Not long after HIV-1 was discovered, a new subtype was discovered in Portugal from patients from West Africa and was later called HIV-2. Through cloning and sequence analysis (genetic makeup), HIV-2 is 55% different from HIV-1 and is antigenically distinct. Another major difference between the two virus strains lies in the envelope glycoproteins. Further studies suggest that HIV-2 originates from SIV (a retrovirus that infects primates) due to sequence similarities and cross-reactions between antibodies against the two types of viruses. The two HIV species that infect humans (HIV-1 and -2) originally originated in west and central Africa, passing from primates to humans in a process known as zoonoses. HIV-1 is the result of the evolution of the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVcpz) found in the chimpanzee subspecies, Pan troglodyte troglodyte. Meanwhile, HIV-2 is a viral species resulting from the evolution of a different SIV strain (SIVsmm), found in Sooty mangabey, Guinea-Bissau old world monkey. Most of the HIV infections in the world are caused by HIV-1 because this viral species is more virulent and more easily transmitted than HIV-2. Meanwhile, HIV-2 remains largely confined to West Africa. Based on its genetic makeup, HIV-1 is divided into three main groups, namely M, N, and O. The M HIV-1 group consists of 16 different subtypes. While in groups N and O it is not yet clear how many virus subtypes are included in them. However, both groups are related to the SIV of chimpanzees.",

If several HIV viruses with different subtypes infect the same individual, a circulating recombinant form (CRF) will occur (English: circulating recombinant form, CRF). Parts of the genomes of different HIV subtypes combine to form a new whole genome. The first form of recombinant discovered was recombinant AG from central and western Africa, then recombinant AGI from Greece and Cyprus, then recombinant AB from Russia and AE from southeast Asia. Of all HIV infections that occur in the world, as many as 47% of cases are caused by subtype C, 27% are CRF02_AG, 12.3% are subtype B, 5.3% are subtype D and 3.2% are CRF AE, while the rest come from subtype and CRF. other. HIV has a diameter of 100-150\u00a0nm and is spherical to oval due to the shape of the sheath that surrounds the viral particles (virions). The viral envelope originates from the host cell membrane, which is mostly composed of lipids. Inside the sheath is a section called the protein matrix. The internal part of HIV consists of two main components, namely the genome and the capsid. The genome is the genetic material at the core of the virus in the form of two copies of a single strand of RNA. Meanwhile, the capsid is a protein that wraps and protects the genome. Unlike most retroviruses, which have only three genes (gag, pol, and env), HIV has an additional six (vif, vpu, vpr, tat, ref, and nef). These genes are encoded by viral RNA which is 9 kb in size. The nine genes are grouped into three categories based on their function, namely structural protein coding genes (Gag, Pol, Env), regulatory proteins (Tat, Rev), and accessory genes (Vpu only in HIV-1, Vpx only in HIV-2; Vpr , Vif, Nef).",

        "paragraph": "Like other viruses in general, HIV can only replicate by utilizing host cells. The HIV cycle begins with the attachment of viral particles (virions) to receptors on the host cell surface, including CD4, CXCR5, and CXCR5. The cells that HIV targets are dendritic cells, T cells, and macrophages. These cells are found on the surface of the inner skin lining (mucosa) of the penis, vagina and oral cavity, which is usually the initial site of HIV infection. In addition, HIV can also directly enter the bloodstream and enter and replicate in lymph nodes. After attaching, the virus envelope will fuse with the cell membrane so that the contents of the virus particles will be released inside the cell. Furthermore, the reverse transcriptase enzyme that HIV has will change the viral genome in the form of RNA into DNA. Then, the viral DNA will be carried to the human cell nucleus so that it can insert or integrate with human DNA. Viral DNA that inserts into human DNA is called a provirus and can survive long enough in cells. When the cell is activated, certain enzymes belonging to the host cell will process the provirus the same as human DNA, which is converted into mRNA. Then, the mRNA is taken out of the cell nucleus and becomes a template for making HIV proteins and enzymes. Part of the RNA of the provirus which is the RNA genome of the virus. Parts of the RNA genome will be assembled with proteins and enzymes to become a complete virus. At this assembly stage, the HIV protease enzyme plays an important role in cutting long proteins into short parts that make up the core of the virus. When intact HIV has matured, the virus can leave the host cell and infect the next cell. The process of releasing the virus is through budding, where the virus will get an envelope from the surface membrane of the host cell.",

And in the fourth stage, it has complications, is difficult to cure and is usually followed by death. Generally, there are three types of HIV detection, namely PCR tests, HIV antibody tests, and HIV antigen tests. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test is a nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) based detection technique that can detect the presence of HIV genetic material in the human body. This test is also known as a viral load test or nucleic acid amplification test (HIV NAAT). DNA PCR is usually a qualitative method that can only detect the presence or absence of viral DNA. Meanwhile, the detection of viral RNA can be done using the real-time PCR method, which is a quantitative method. This nucleic acid detection can detect the presence of HIV at 11-16 days since the initial infection occurred. This test is usually used to detect HIV in newborns, but is rarely used in adults because the cost of the PCR test is expensive and the level of difficulty managing and interpreting the results of this test is higher than other tests. To detect HIV in adults, more and more often use inexpensive and accurate HIV antibody tests. A person infected with HIV will produce antibodies to fight the infection. An HIV antibody test will detect antibodies that form in blood, saliva (saliva), and urine.

Apart from ELISA, another HIV antibody test that can be used for further examination is the Western blot. Antigen tests can detect the antigen (P24 protein) in HIV that triggers an antibody response. In the early stages of HIV infection, P24 is produced in high amounts and can be found in the blood serum. Antibody tests and antigen tests are used continuously to provide more accurate and earlier detection results. This test is rarely used alone because of its low sensitivity and can only work before antibodies to HIV are formed. All of the above methods detect the virus, but the cheapest way is the CD4 test which is only Rp. 100,000 more at the Cancer Hospital. CD4 does not test for the presence of the HIV virus, or specific antibodies against HIV, it measures a patient's immune system. Previously, if the CD4 had not reached a certain value, even though the presence of the HIV virus was known, then no treatment had been carried out, but now if the presence of the HIV virus is known, then regardless of the CD4 value, treatment must be carried out. In Indonesia, where funding is a problem, the CD4 test sufficient for early detection of the possible presence of the HIV virus.

Certain fluids include blood, semen, vaginal secretions, and breast milk. Several routes of HIV transmission that are known are through sexual contact, from mother to child (perinatal), use of intravenous drugs, transfusions and transplants, and occupational exposure. But for every single action, the most risky is a blood transfusion from a blood donor with HIV where the possibility of the recipient being infected with HIV reaches 90 percent, while pregnant women with HIV who give birth and breastfeed are likely to transmit HIV to their babies by 25 percent, but by administering medicines and appropriate treatment at the time of birth and afterward, this figure can be reduced to just 1 to 2 percent. Currently, all blood from donors is screened for HIV, so that cases of transmission through blood transfusions are virtually non-existent. According to WHO data, in 1983-1995, as much as 70-80% of HIV transmission was carried out through heterosexual intercourse, while 5-10% occurred through homosexual intercourse. Sexual contact through vaginal and anal has a greater risk of transmitting HIV than oral sex contact. Some other factors that can increase the risk of transmission through sexual contact are the presence of sexually transmitted diseases, the quantity of viral load, the use of douches. Someone who suffers from other sexually transmitted diseases (for example: syphilis, genital herpes, gonorrhea, etc.) will more easily accept and transmit HIV to other people who have sex with him. Virus load is the amount of active virus present in the body.

The use of douche can increase the risk of HIV transmission because it destroys good bacteria around the vagina and anus which have a protective function. In addition, the use of douche after sexual intercourse can suppress disease-causing bacteria from entering the body and causing infection. Prevention of HIV through sexual intercourse can be done by not having multiple partners and using condoms. Another way of prevention is to have sex without exposure to bodily fluids. To reduce the viral load in the genital tract and blood, anti-retroviral therapy can be used. HIV transmission from mother to child can occur through in utero infection, during the delivery process, and through breastfeeding. Several other maternal and external factors can influence HIV transmission to infants, including the abundance of virus and immune cells in the first trimester, premature birth, and others. Decreased immune cells (CD4+) in the mother and high viral RNA can increase the risk of HIV transmission from mother to child. In addition, a study on pregnant women in Malawi and the US also stated that vitamin A deficiency can increase the risk of HIV infection. The risk of perinatal transmission can be carried out by caesarean delivery, not giving breast milk, and giving AZT in late pregnancy and after the baby is born. In some developing countries, prevention of breastfeeding from HIV/AIDS sufferers to babies faces difficulties because the price of formula milk as a substitute is relatively expensive. In addition, mothers must also have access to clean water and understand how to prepare formula milk properly.

It is said that in Sri Lanka this wood was used to embalm the bodies of the king's daughters since the 9th century. In Indonesia, this wood is mostly found in East Nusa Tenggara, especially on the island of Timor, although now it can also be found on the island of Java and other Nusa Tenggara islands. Sandalwood is a parasitic plant in its early life. The sprouts need a host tree to support their growth, because their own roots are not able to support their life. It is because of these prerequisites that sandalwood is difficult to breed or cultivate. Fragrant sandalwood (Santalum album) is now very rare and very expensive. In Indonesia, sandalwood from Timor is also highly valued. As a substitute, a number of aromatherapy and perfume experts use sandalwood jenggi (Santalum spicatum). These two types of wood differ in the concentration of the chemicals they contain, and therefore the level of fragrance is also different. Sandalwood is considered as an alternative medicine to bring people closer to God. Sandalwood base oil, which is very expensive in its pure form, is used primarily for Ayurvedic healing, and for alleviating anxiety. This sandalwood plant is very rare due to over-exploitation. There are two types of sandalwood, namely red sandalwood and white sandalwood. Red sandalwood grows a lot in Funan and India, while white sandalwood grows a lot in East Nusa Tenggara, including on the islands of Flores, Alor, Sumba, Solor, Adonara, Lomblen, Pantar, Timor, Rote and Sabu. In terms of quality, the two are not the same. Red sandalwood is relatively less fragrant and of poor quality, so it is not very popular in trade.

The essential oil obtained from the outermost part of the wood contains 3% oxygen components (Santalol, santalil, acetate) and 50% hydrocarbons (santalena). Sandalwood oil also contains seskiterpene acid compounds, namely dihydroa-norcurkumenic acid, a-bergamotinic acid and dihydro-oc-santhalic acid. Apart from the essential oil substance, Mathieson et al (1973) stated that sandalwood also contains dyes called santalin and santarubin. The bark contains triterpenes, palmitic acid derivatives and tannins with a content of 14%. Sandalwood (Santalum album L.) is generally found in areas with an annual rainfall range of 600-2,000 mm; Sandalwood can grow optimally in the range of rainfall 850\u20131350 mm per year, and is still tolerant of up to 2500 mm rainfall per year, but must have a good drainage system. The original habitat where sandalwood grows usually has a long dry season and a short rainy season, 2-3 months per year.

In fertile Hat (loam) soil, sandalwood trees grow well and grow big quickly, but the oil content is very low and the quality is also not good. Sandalwood trees have no tolerance for soils containing high salt and lime, but can tolerate soils containing sodium (sodic soils). Sandalwood (Santalum album L.) is a plant originating from the Indonesian archipelago, namely the Outer Banda Arc of Islands, which is located in the southeast of Indonesia, and mainly between the islands of Timor and Sumba. The history of the sandalwood trade in the past has contributed to the fact that sandalwood is a native plant in East Nusa Tenggara, especially on the islands of Timor and Sumba. The existence of sandalwood growing in India is related to the sandalwood trade in the past, which was then imported to India, and developed in India in areas with climates and habitats such as those in East Nusa Tenggara, especially on the islands of Timor and Sumba.",

Hsing-cha Shenglan in 1436 during the Ming Dynasty, described the mountains on the island of Timor as covered by sandalwood trees and this area did not produce any other wood, apart from sandalwood. Indeed, Chinese trade at that time was very rapid; the ships used for this purpose weighed 1500 tons or more, far more than any European fleet at the time. For example, Vasco da Gama's ship is almost 300 tons. In the 15th century, China obtained sandalwood through the Malacca market. The Chinese market fell into disrepair in the early 1800s with competition for sandalwood from India and with extensive logging in the Pacific Islands. The Chinese market improved temporarily in 1890 and 1900, as Pacific supplies declined, especially the Hawaiian and Marquesa Islands lost all their sandalwood trees in a few years; and in addition, then demand from Europe increased. Guillemard (1894) mentions that the Bugis people then played an important role, controlling trade from Portuguese Timor (East Timor). A small-scale trade in sandalwood is also taking place with the Kisar and Leti people from southwest Maluku who visit Wetar to obtain sandalwood and food ingredients. Since the 1920s, Flores has been exporting sandalwood, but Timor's extensive sandalwood stands are nearly depleted. This is partly due to the discovery that sandalwood oil can also be extracted from the root. Since 1436, the island of Timor has been famous for the production of sandalwood, it is even said that this island has no other wealth besides this special fragrant wood.",

Living organisms undergo metabolism, maintain homeostasis, have the ability to grow, respond to stimuli, reproduce, and\u2014through natural selection\u2014adapt to their environment in successive generations. More complex living organisms can communicate in a variety of ways. The general characteristics of these organisms are carbon- and water-based cells, with complex organization and heritable genetic information. Abiogenesis is the natural process by which life arises from non-living matter, such as simple organic compounds. The current scientific hypothesis states that the transition from non-living to living entities is not a single event, but a gradual process of increasing complexity. Life on Earth first appeared 4.28 billion years ago, after the oceans formed 4.41 billion years ago, and shortly after Earth formed 4.54 billion years ago. The earliest known forms of life are bacterial microfossils. Researchers generally think that life today originated in the RNA world, even though RNA-based life may not have been the first life that ever existed.

The cell is considered the structural and functional unit of life. There are two types of cells, namely prokaryotes and eukaryotes, which consist of a cytoplasm enclosed in a membrane and contain many biomolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids. Cells reproduce by cell division, which is the process when the parent cell divides into two or more daughter cells.

Later, new groups and categories of life were discovered, such as cells and microorganisms, which revised the structure of the relationships among living organisms.

Defining \"life\" is difficult, because life is a process, not a pure substance. Any definition must be broad enough to encompass all known life, and it must be general enough that, with it, scientists will not miss out on life that may be fundamentally different from life on earth. Since there is no firm definition of life, the current understanding is descriptive: life is a feature of organisms that exhibit all or most of the following phenomena, namely: To represent the minimum necessary phenomena, several other biological definitions have been proposed, including: Viruses are more common considered a replicator rather than a life form. They have been described as \"organisms at the edge of life,\" because they possess genes, evolved by natural selection, and replicate by creating multiple copies of themselves through self-assembly. However, viruses do not metabolize and need stem cells to make new products.

Such general theories, which have emerged from the sciences of ecology and biology, seek to map out general principles for how all living systems work. Instead of examining phenomena by trying to break things down into their component parts, general living systems theory investigates phenomena in terms of dynamic patterns of the relationships of organisms to their environment. The idea that the Earth is alive has existed for a long time, but it was only established as scientific fact by the Scottish scientist James Hutton in 1785. He stated that the earth was a superorganism, and that proper research had to be physiological. Hutton is remembered as the father of geology, but the idea of \u200b\u200ba living earth was forgotten in the forceful reductionism of the 19th century. The Gaia Hypothesis, originally proposed in the 1960s by scientist James Lovelock, is the idea that life on Earth functions as a single organism that actually defines and maintains the environmental conditions necessary for survival. Robert Rosen (1991) makes the assumption that the explanatory power of a mechanistic worldview cannot help understand living systems. One of the important clarifications he made was to define a system component as \"an organizational unit; a part with a function, that is, a defined relationship between the part and the whole.\" From these and other early concepts, he developed a \"relational theory of systems\" that attempted to explain the special properties of life. In particular, he identified the \"indivisible component in organisms\" as a fundamental difference between living systems and \"biological machinery.\" A systems view of life treats environmental flows and biological flows together as \"reciprocal influences\", and this interrelationship with the environment is arguably as important for understanding life as it is for understanding ecosystems.",

Robert Ulanowicz (2009) also underscores mutualism as the key to understanding systems, resulting in the behavior of life and ecosystems. Some of the earliest theories of life were materialist, holding that all that exists is matter, and that all life is fundamentally a complex form or arrangement of matter. Empedocles (430 BC) argued that everything in the universe is composed of a combination of four eternal \"elements\" or \"roots of all\": earth, water, air, and fire. All changes are explained by the arrangement and rearrangement of the four elements. Various life forms are caused by the proper mixture of elements. For example, plant growth is due to the natural downward movement of the earth element and the natural upward movement of fire. Demokritos (460 BC), a student of Leucippos, thought that an important characteristic of life was having a soul (psyche). As with other ancient writers, he also used the term to mean the principle of living beings that causes them to function as living beings. He thought that the soul was composed of fire atoms, because of the apparent connection between life and heat, and because fire moves. He also stated that humans initially lived like animals, gradually developing a society to help others, starting languages, and developing crafts and agriculture. In the scientific revolution of the 17th century, mechanistic ideas were revived by philosophers such as Ren\u00e9 Descartes. Hylemorphism is a theory coined by Aristotle (322 BC).

The form of a living thing is its soul (in Greek, psyche , Latin anima). According to Aristotle, there are three kinds of souls, namely: Each higher soul has all the attributes of a lower soul. Aristotle believed that while matter could exist without form, form could not exist without matter, and so the soul could not exist without a body. An explanation that harmonizes with hylemorphism is a teleological explanation of life. A teleological explanation explains phenomena in terms of the intent or purpose of those phenomena. Thus, the white color of the polar bear is explained for camouflage purposes. This kind of direction of causation is contrary to materialistic science, which explains the effects of prior causes. Modern biologists now reject this functional view in terms of matter and causation: biological traits must be explained not by looking forward for optimal future outcomes, but by looking backward into the evolutionary history of a species, leading to natural selection. of the object in question.

This is a historical event, because for the first time an organic compound was produced from inorganic reactants. Later, Hermann von Helmholtz, preceded by Julius Robert von Mayer, showed that no energy is lost in muscle movement, which shows that no \"vital force\" is needed to move it. This empirical observation led to the neglect of the vitalistic theory in science, although this belief survives in non-scientific theories such as homeopathy, which interprets various ailments as being caused by disturbances in the vital force or life force. Evidence suggests that life on earth has existed for around 3.7 billion years. All known forms of life have a basic molecular mechanism, and based on this observation, theories of the origin of life attempt to find a mechanism that explains the formation of the one cell, the primordial organism from which all life originated. There are different hypotheses about the path taken from simple organic molecules through pre-cellular life to protocells and metabolism. Many models fall into the \"gene first\" or \"metabolism-first\" category, but a recent trend is the emergence of hybrid models that combine both categories. There is no scientific consensus on how life began and all proposed theories are highly speculative. However, most accepted scientific models are built in one way or another on the following hypotheses: Life as we know it today synthesizes proteins, which are polymers of amino acids using instructions encoded by cellular genes\u2014which are polymer of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).

Most scientists have adopted the hypothesis that because DNA and protein function together so intimately, it seems unlikely that they arose independently. Because of this, many scientists are considering the possibility, apparently first proposed by Francis Crick, that the first life was based on a DNA-protein intermediate: RNA. In fact, RNA has the information storage and replication properties and catalytic properties of some proteins which are similar to DNA. Crick and other scientists supported the RNA-first hypothesis even before the catalytic properties of RNA had been demonstrated by Thomas Cech. An important problem with the RNA-first hypothesis is that experiments designed to synthesize RNA from simple precursors have not been as successful as the Miller\u2013Urey experiments which synthesized other organic molecules from inorganic precursors. One of the reasons for the failure to make RNA in the laboratory is that the RNA precursors are very stable and do not react with each other under ambient conditions. However, the successful synthesis of certain RNA molecules under presumably the same conditions as before life appeared on Earth has been achieved by adding alternative precursors in specific sequences to the phosphate precursors present during the reaction. This research makes the RNA-first hypothesis more plausible to many scientists. Recent experiments have demonstrated the true Darwinian evolution of a unique RNA enzyme (ribozyme) composed of two separate catalytic components that replicate one another in vitro.

As a result of this microbial activity on a geological time scale, the physico-chemical environment on Earth has changed, thus determining the next path of life's evolution. For example, the release of molecular oxygen by cyanobacteria as a by-product of photosynthesis causes global changes. The changing environment posed new evolutionary challenges for then-existing organisms, which eventually led to the formation of animals and plants on our planet.

Outside this zone is the \"zone of intolerance,\" which makes it impossible for the organism to live. It has been determined that organisms with a wider range of resistance are more dispersive than organisms with a narrow range of resistance.

Characterization of the structure and metabolic diversity of microbial communities in these extreme environments is ongoing. Understanding the persistence and flexibility of life on Earth, as well as understanding the molecular systems that some organisms rely on to survive in extreme conditions, will provide an important foundation for the search for life beyond Earth.

Traditionally, humans have divided organisms into classes of plants and animals, based primarily on their ability to move. The first known attempt to classify organisms was made by the Greek philosopher Aristotle (384-322 BC). He classified all living organisms known at that time as plants and animals.

Exploration of the Americas revealed a large number of new plants and animals that required description and classification. In the late 16th and early 17th centuries, animal studies began and gradually expanded until they formed a body of knowledge sufficient to serve as the anatomical basis for classification. In the late 1740's, Carolus Linnaeus introduced his method, which is still used, for formulating the scientific name of each species. Linnaeus strove to improve the composition and reduce the length of multiword names by eliminating unnecessary rhetoric, introducing new descriptive terms and defining their meaning with unprecedented precision. By consistently using that system, Linnaeus separated nomenclature from taxonomy. This naming convention for species is known as binomial nomenclature. Mushrooms were originally thought of as plants. For a short time Linnaeus had them in the Vermes group in Animalia. He then placed them back in Plantae.

The classification of eukaryotes is still controversial, and the taxonomy of protists is problematic. As microbiology, molecular biology and virology developed, non-cellular reproductive agents were discovered, such as viruses and viroids. Sometimes these entities are considered to be living but some argue that viruses are not living organisms as they lack characteristics such as cell membranes, metabolism and do not grow or respond to their environment. While viruses can be classified into \"species\" based on biology and genetics, many aspects of this classification remain controversial.

Panspermia is the hypothesis that life originated elsewhere in the universe and was then transferred to Earth in the form of spores which were possibly transferred via meteorites, comets or cosmic dust.

After death, the remains of organisms become part of the biogeochemical cycles. Organisms can be consumed by predators or scavengers and the remaining organic matter can then be further broken down by detritivores, organisms that recycle detritus, returning it to the environment for reuse in the food chain.

Mah\u0101y\u0101na, who was born in India, is used in three main senses: Although the origins of Mah\u0101y\u0101na date back to Gautama Buddha, historians have concluded that Mah\u0101y\u0101na originated in India in the 1st century, or 1st century BC. According to historians, Mahayana became a major movement in Buddhism in India in the 5th century, from that time Mahayana texts began to appear in inscriptions in India. Prior to the 11th century (when Mahayana was still in India), the Mahayana Sutras were still in the process of being refined. Therefore, multiple silks of the same silk may appear. These translations are not considered by historians to form Mahayana history. In the course of its history, Mah\u0101y\u0101na spread throughout East Asia. Countries that adhere to Mahayana teachings today are China, Japan, Korea and Vietnam and adherents of Tibetan Buddhism (the Himalayan ethnicity resulting from the Chinese invasion of Tibet). The current schools of Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism are \"Pure Land\", Zen, Nichiren, Singon, Tibetan and Tendai. The last three have schools of both Mah\u0101y\u0101na and Vajrayana teachings. Buddha was born in the 6th century BC. After attaining Perfect Enlightenment at the age of 35 to Mahaparinibbana at the age of 80, He spent his whole life preaching and spreading his teachings. For 44 years, he meditated, taught and preached day and night, sleeping only 2 hours a day. The Buddha spoke to all kinds of people: kings and princes, brahmins, farmers, beggars, learned men and common people.",

His teachings are tailored to the experience, level of understanding and mental capacity of his listeners. What he taught is called the Buddha Vacana. At that time it was not known as Theravada or Mah\u0101y\u0101na. After the formation of the Sangha assembly of Bhiku and Bhikuni, the Buddha laid down certain disciplinary rules called the Vinaya as guidelines for the community. All of his teachings are called Dhamma, including discourses, sutras, sermons to monks, nuns and ordinary people. Three months after Buddha Mahaparinibbana, his closest followers held a assembly at Rajagaha. Maha Kassapa, the most respected and elder of the monks, presided over the assembly. Also present were two disciples who were especially skilled in two teachings \u2013 Dhamma and Vinaya (discipline, ethics). One was Ananda, the closest friend and follower of the Buddha for 25 years. Gifted with an extraordinary memory, Ananda was able to repeat what the Buddha had said. Another was Upali who memorized all the Vinaya rules. Only these two teachings - the Dhamma and the Vinaya - were recited at the First Council. Although there is no disagreement about the Dhamma (excluding the Abhidhamma), there is some discussion about the Vinaya rules. Before the Buddha's parinibbana, he told Ananda that if the Sangha wanted to correct or change some baseless rules, they could do so. But at that time, Ananda was so grieved over the imminent death of the Buddha that he did not ask the Buddha which of the rules he was referring to. Since the members of the assembly could not agree on what was meant by the non-fundamental rules, Maha Kassapa finally decreed that the rules laid down by the Buddha were not changed and no new rules were added.",

Maha Kassapa did say one thing however: \"If we changed the rules, people will say that Venerable Gotama's disciples changed the rules even before his funeral fire has ceased burning.\" In assembly, the Dhamma is divided into several parts and each part is left to the senior followers and their students to memorize. Then, the Dhamma is taught by the teacher to his students orally. The Dhamma was recited daily by groups of students who often double-checked with each other to make sure nothing was omitted or added. Historians agree that oral traditions are more accurate than writings made by a person according to what he remembers after many years of events. One hundred years later, a second council was held to discuss the Vinaya rules. There was no need to change the rules three months after the Buddha's parinibbana because there was little political, economic or social change in such a short period at that time. But 100 years later, some monks saw the need to change some of the baseless rules. Orthodox monks say that nothing needs to be changed while others want to change the rules. Eventually, a group of monks left the assembly and founded the Mahasanghika \u2013 the Great Order. At a time when it was still called Mahasanghika, there was no such thing as Mah\u0101y\u0101na. And at the second council, only matters relating to the Vinaya were discussed and there was no debate about the Dhamma. In the 3rd century BC during the reign of King Asoka, the third council was held to discuss differences of opinion among monks of different sects. At this council, the differences were not limited to the Vinaya but also related to the Dhamma. At the end of this assembly, the assembly president, Monggaliputta Tissa, wrote a book called Kathavatthu.",

The Abhidhamma Pitaka was included at this assembly. After the third assembly, Asoka's son, Biku Mahinda, brought the Tripitaka along with the explanations discussed in this third council to Sri Lanka. The text that was brought is still preserved today in Sri Lanka without losing a single page. The text is written in Pali. This text is based on the Magadhi language spoken by the Buddha. It was not known what was called Mah\u0101y\u0101na until this period. Some sources say that a counter-Grand Council was held on the side of the Mahayana aspirant lineage. However, the fact is that these schools were later included in the streams that were \"less\" in favor of Mah\u0101y\u0101na, and could even be said to compete with Mah\u0101y\u0101na in northern India. Between the 1st century BC to the 1st century AD, both the terms Mah\u0101y\u0101na and Hinayana appear in the Lotus Sutra on the Teaching of Virtue. It was only around the 2nd century AD that Mah\u0101y\u0101na was clearly defined. Nagarjuna developed the Mahayana philosophy of \"emptiness\" and proved that everything is \"Empty\" in the little book \"Madhyamika-karika\". Around the 4th century, Asanga and Vasubandhu wrote many Mah\u0101y\u0101na books. After the 1st century AD, the Mahayana took a firm stance and after that the terms Mah\u0101y\u0101na and Hinayana came to be known. In the 7th century, the Chinese monk, I-Tsing, described the situation in India at that time in the words, \"...Anyone who worships the Bodhisattva and studies the Mah\u0101y\u0101na sutras is called a Mahayanis, while those who do not are called Hinayanists...\" in such a way simply put.

The Hinayana school was developed in India and is independent of the existence of the school of Buddhism in Sri Lanka. Currently there are no more Hinayana schools in any part of the world. Therefore, in 1950 the World Fellowship of Buddhists formed in Colombo unanimously decided that the term Hinaya should be excluded when referring to Buddhism that exists today in Sri Lanka, Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos, and others. This is a brief history of Theravada, Mahayana and Hinayana. It should be noted that there is no fundamental difference between the Mah\u0101y\u0101na and Theravada teachings. This can be seen from the exact same teachings regarding: The teachings above are the most basic teachings in Buddhism. There are several things that make the two different. Many say that Mah\u0101y\u0101na is to attain the Bodhisattva which opens the path to Buddhahood, where Theravada is to attain Arhat. It should be emphasized that the Buddha was also an Arahant. Paccekabuddha is also an Arahant. A follower can also become an Arahant. The Mah\u0101y\u0101na texts never use the term Arahant-yana, the Arahant path. But using three terms: Bodhisattvayana, Prateka-Buddhayana and Sravakayana. In the Theravada tradition, these three are known as Bodhi. Some argue that Theravada is selfish because it teaches people to save themselves. Can selfish people attain Enlightenment? Both schools adhere to the three yana or bodhi but regard the Bodhisattva as the highest attainment. Mahayana creates Bodhisattvas whereas Theravada considers a Bodhisattva to be one of us who devotes his entire life to attaining Consummation, whose ultimate goal is Perfect Enlightenment for the happiness of beings in the world.",

Without first attaining enlightenment yourself, how is it possible to enlighten other beings? As information becomes more open, today more and more Pali texts can be accessed. And it is evident that even in the Pali tradition one can find texts on the Bodhisattva path in collections of Jataka tales and commentaries which mention various types of Bodhi. So, Theravada also knows the Bodhisatta path, the Sammasambodhi path, at least in the form of the story of the completion of the 10 Parami. This unpopularity of the idea of \u200b\u200bsammasambodhi does not necessarily mean that Theravada is ignorant of the Bodhisatta path. Today's great masters of various schools also teach that all Buddhist schools have different approaches, but will eventually reach the same realization. If the philosophical debate continues, of course all schools will continue to hold on to their respective views. But when one looks into reality, the direct experience one gets from the practice of meditation, then one experiences that reality that is so indisputable, anicca-anatta, the insight that puts an end to dukkha. There are three types of Buddhas, namely: the Samma Sambuddha who attained enlightenment by his own efforts, the Pacceka Buddha at a lower level than the Samma Sambuddha, and the Savaka Buddha who is an Arahant. The attainment of Nibbana among the three is the same. There is only a difference for the Samma Sambuddha who has more levels and abilities than the two. Some people think that the \"Empty\" or Emptiness taught by Nagarjuna is purely Mah\u0101y\u0101na teaching. This idea basically arises from the concept of Anatta or \"Not-I\", in the Patticasamuppada or Dependent Origination, which is found in the original Theravada Pali texts.",

The earliest traces of human life in the area now known as Argentina date back to the Paleolithic, with further traces from the Mesolithic and Neolithic ages. Until the time of European colonization, Argentina was relatively sparsely populated with a large number of culturally diverse groups with distinct social organizations, which can be divided into three main groups. The first group is basic food hunters and gatherers without pottery making, such as the Seknam people and the Yag\u00e1n people in the far south. The second group is the advanced hunter-gatherer group which includes the Puelche, Querand\u00ed, and the Serrano people of the east-central; and the Tehuelche people in the south\u2014all conquered by the Mapuche people who spread out from Chile\u2014and the Qom and Wichi people in the north. The final group are farmers with pottery, such as the Charr\u00faa, Minuane, and Guaran\u00ed people in the northeast, with a slash-and-burn (shifting cultivation) existence; the Diaguita people who practice an advanced sedentary trading culture in the northwest, who were conquered by the Inca Empire around 1480; Toconot\u00e9 and the H\u00ean\u00eea and K\u00e2m\u00eeare people in the center of the country, and the Huarpe people in the mid-west, a culture that raises llamas and is heavily influenced by the Incas.",

The Spanish Empire subordinated the economic potential of the Argentine region to the direct wealth of silver and gold mines in Bolivia and Peru, and so became part of the Monarchy of Per\u00fa until the creation of the Grand Duchy of the R\u00edo de la Plata in 1776 with Buenos Aires as its seat of government. Buenos Aires resisted two ill-fated British invasions in 1806 and 1807. The ideas of the Enlightenment and the example of the first Atlantic Revolution sparked criticism of the absolute empire that ruled the country. As in the rest of Spanish America, the overthrow of Fernando VII in the Spanish War of Independence created great concern. Triggering the process of the emergence of Argentina as the successor state to Viziership, the May Revolution of 1810 replaced the vizurai Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros with the Primera Junta, a new government in Buenos Aires composed by local residents.",

However, the interior provinces soon rose against him, forcing his resignation and rejecting the constitution. The Centralists and Federalists continued the civil war; the latter won and formed the Argentine Confederation in 1831, led by Juan Manuel de Rosas.

Regarding political divisions, the country is divided into 24 provinces, which in turn are divided into 530 departments, partidos and communes which are divided into municipalities. Argentina is one of the most bio-diverse countries in the world hosting one of the world's largest varieties of ecosystems: 15 continental zones, 2 nautical zones, and the Antarctic region; all are represented within the territory of Argentina. This gigantic variety of ecosystems has ushered Argentina into the world's largest group of biological diversity: Pampa is virtually treeless; some are imported species, such as Platanus occidentalis or eucalyptus growing on roadsides or in cities and state-owned plantations (estancias).",

In general, Argentina has four main climate types: warm, temperate, arid, and cool, all determined by their latitudinal position, elevation range, and relief features. Although the densely populated region generally has a temperate climate, Argentina has an extraordinary variety of climates, ranging from subtropical in the north to arctic in the far south. As a result, there is a wide variety of biomes in the country, including subtropical rainforest, semi-arid and arid regions, the temperate plains of the Pampa, and the cold sub-antarctic south.

Climate change in Argentina is expected to have a significant impact on living conditions in Argentina. :30 Argentina's climate is changing, related to rainfall patterns and temperature. The highest increase in rainfall (from 1960\u20132010) has occurred in the eastern part of the country. Increased rainfall has led to more year-to-year variability of rainfall in northern Argentina, with a higher risk of prolonged drought, to the detriment of agriculture in this area. The main environmental problem in Argentina is pollution caused by poor waste management; deforestation and desertification, caused by poor management of agricultural land; and the indiscriminate use of pesticides, which affects Argentina's biodiversity and population. In the 20th century, Argentina experienced significant democratic backsliding and political turmoil. Between 1930 and 1976, the armed forces overthrew six governments in Argentina; and the country experienced alternating periods of democracy (1912\u20131930, 1946\u20131955, and 1973\u20131976) with periods of confined democracy and military rule.

This system connects all 23 provinces plus the City of Buenos Aires, and links with all neighboring countries. There are four incompatible railroad track widths in use; this forced almost all interstate freight traffic to pass through Buenos Aires. This system had been in decline since the 1940s: regularly running large budget deficits, by 1991 it was carrying 1,400 times less goods than it had done in 1973.",

A symbiosis developed between the native and Spanish traditions, creating a distinct literature, confined geographically (until the 18th century) to the northern and central regions of Argentina, centered on the Province of Cordoba. This was partly due to the founding of the National University of Cordoba. Two names from this period that stand out are: Gaspar Ju\u00e1rez Baviano and Mar\u00eda Antonia de Paz y Figueroa, also known as Mama Antula. The country's name itself also comes from the Latin language which first appears in a literary text, the epic poem \"La Argentina\", by Mart\u00edn del Barco Centenera from 1602. The work consists of 10,000 stanzas and describes landscapes and conquest of territory. The word was reintroduced in La Argentina manuscrita, a historical prose by Ruy D\u00edaz de Guzm\u00e1n. With the economic prosperity of the port area, the cultural axis is gradually moving east. During the 17th century, Baroque in Argentina tended to be poorer than Europe and other parts of the New World.

Argentina has a rich literary history and one of the most active publishing industries in the region. Argentine writers have been prominent in Latin American literature since the 1850s. The rivalry between the Federalist and Unionist parties set the tone for Argentine literature at the time. Although Argentina's rich literary history begins around 1550, Argentine literature achieved complete independence with Esteban Echeverr\u00eda's El Matadero (The Slaughterhouse), a romantic landmark that was instrumental in the development of 19th-century Argentine narratives, riven by ideological divisions between the populace, the story of the federalist hero Mart\u00edn Fierro by Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez confronts the elitist and cultured discourse, Sarmiento's Facundo.",

Argentine literature of this period was deeply nationalistic. This period was followed by the modernist movement, which emerged in France in the late 19th century. Among the exponents of the modernist movement that emerged in the 20th century were Leopoldo Lugones and the poet Alfonsina Storni. This period was in turn followed by works of avant-garde or Vanguardism, with Ricardo G\u00fciraldes' Don Segundo Sombra as an important reference material.

Inflation is related to market mechanisms which can be caused by various factors, including: increased public consumption, excess liquidity in the market which triggers consumption or even speculation, including the result of uneven distribution of goods. In addition, economic instability and sales levels also cause inflation. In other words, inflation is also a continuous process of decreasing currency values. Inflation is a process of an event, not the highs and lows of the price level. That is, a price level that is considered high does not necessarily indicate inflation. Inflation is an indicator to see the level of change, and is considered to occur if the price increase process takes place continuously and influences each other. The term inflation is also used to mean an increase in the money supply which is sometimes seen as the cause of rising prices. There are many ways to measure the inflation rate, the two most frequently used are the CPI and the GDP deflator. In general, inflation is caused by an increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Not only that, inflation was also affected by rising prices of basic commodities. The pull of demand (excess liquidity/money/medium of exchange), as well as pressure (pressure) on production or distribution (lack of production (product or service) and/or also includes a lack of distribution) are also causes of inflation. References are needed] For the first reason it is more influenced from the role of the state in monetary policy (Central Bank), while for the second reason it is more influenced by the role of the state in executor policies which in this case are held by the Government such as fiscal (taxation/levies/incentives/disincentives), infrastructure development policies, regulations, etc. Demand inflation (English: demand pull inflation) occurs due to excessive total demand which is usually triggered by a flood of liquidity in the market resulting in high demand and triggering changes in the price level.",

        "paragraph": "An increase in the volume of the medium of exchange or liquidity associated with the demand for goods and services results in an increase in the demand for these factors of production. The increased demand for factors of production then causes the prices of factors of production to increase. So, this inflation occurs because of an increase in total demand when the economy in question is in a full employment situation which is usually caused by excessive stimulation of the volume of liquidity in the market. The flood of liquidity in the market was also caused by many factors apart from the main one, of course, the ability of the central bank to regulate the circulation of money, the central bank's interest rate policy, to speculative actions that took place in the financial industry sector. Cost push inflation (English: cost push inflation) occurs due to scarcity of production and/or also includes scarcity of distribution, even though demand in general has not increased significantly. The existence of an unsmooth distribution flow or reduced production available from the average normal demand can trigger price increases in accordance with the application of the supply-demand law, or also due to the formation of a new position of economic value for the product due to a new distribution pattern or scale. Reduced production itself can occur due to various things such as technical problems at production sources (factories, plantations, etc.), natural disasters, weather, or scarcity of raw materials to produce said production, speculation (hoarding), etc., thus triggering scarcity of related production in the market. Likewise, the same thing can happen to distribution, where in this case the infrastructure factor plays a very important role. An increase in production costs can be caused by 2 things, namely: an increase in prices, for example raw materials and an increase in wages/salary, for example an increase in civil servant salaries will result in private businesses raising the price of goods.",

        "paragraph": "Based on its origin, inflation can be classified into two, namely inflation originating from within the country and inflation originating from abroad. Inflation originates from within the country, for example due to a budget deficit which is financed by printing new money and market failures which result in expensive food prices. Meanwhile, inflation from abroad is inflation that occurs as a result of rising prices of imported goods. This can occur due to the high cost of producing goods abroad or an increase in tariffs on imports of goods. Inflation can also be divided based on the scope of influence on prices. If the price increase that occurs is only related to one or two specific goods, the inflation is called closed inflation (Closed Inflation). However, if price increases occur for all goods in general, then inflation is referred to as open inflation (Open Inflation). Meanwhile, if the inflation attack is so intense that every time the prices keep changing and increasing so that people cannot hold money longer because the value of money continues to decline, it is called uncontrolled inflation (hyperinflation). Based on the severity of inflation can also be distinguished: Inflation is measured by calculating the percentage change in the level of change in a price index. These price indexes include: Inflation has a positive impact and a negative impact depending on whether or not inflation is severe. If inflation is mild, it will actually have a positive effect in the sense that it can drive the economy better, namely increasing national income and making people excited to work, save and invest. Conversely, during periods of severe inflation, namely when inflation is out of control (hyperinflation), the economic situation becomes chaotic and the economy is felt to be sluggish.

        "paragraph": "Recipients of fixed income such as civil servants or private employees and workers will also be overwhelmed to bear and offset prices so that their lives will get worse and worse from time to time. For groups of people who have a fixed income, inflation suffers greatly. Let's take the example of a retired civil servant in 1990. In 1990, his pension money was sufficient to meet his living needs, but in 2003 -or thirteen years later, the purchasing power of his money was probably only half. That is, his pension money is no longer enough to meet his needs. In contrast, people who rely on profit-based income, such as entrepreneurs, are not harmed by inflation. Likewise with employees who work in companies with salaries following the inflation rate. Inflation also causes people to be reluctant to save because the value of the currency decreases. Indeed, savings generate interest, but if the inflation rate is above interest, the value of money will still decrease. If people are reluctant to save, it will be difficult for the business and investment world to develop. Because, to develop the business world requires funds from banks obtained from public savings. For people who borrow money from banks (debtors), inflation is beneficial, because when paying debts to creditors, the value of money is lower than when borrowing. Conversely, creditors or parties who lend money will suffer losses because the value of the money returned is lower when compared to when borrowing. For producers, inflation can be profitable if the income earned is higher than the increase in production costs. If this happens, producers will cause production costs to rise which will ultimately harm producers, so producers are reluctant to continue their production. Manufacturers can stop their production temporarily.",

In general, inflation can result in reduced investment in a country, driving up interest rates, encouraging speculative investment, failure to implement development, economic instability, a balance of payments deficit, and a decline in the standard of living and social welfare. The central bank plays an important role in controlling inflation. The central bank of a country generally tries to control the inflation rate at a reasonable level. Some central banks even have independent authority in the sense that their policies may not be intervened by parties outside the central bank -including the government. This is because a number of studies show that a central bank that is less independent\u2014one of which is due to government intervention aimed at using monetary policy to stimulate the economy\u2014will encourage higher inflation rates. Central banks generally rely on the money supply and/or interest rates as instruments in controlling prices. In addition, the central bank is also obliged to control the exchange rate of the domestic currency. This is because the value of a currency can be internal (reflected by the inflation rate) or external (exchange rate). Currently, the pattern of inflation targeting is widely applied by central banks around the world, including by Bank Indonesia. The central bank through monetary policy can control the money supply to control inflation by using three main monetary policies as follows. Monetary policy is all government policies in the monetary (financial) sector carried out through Bank Indonesia (the central bank) with the aim of maintaining monetary stability so that people's welfare increases. This policy is carried out by the government in line with monetary policy, there are 3 (three) ways that are carried out in fiscal policy, namely as follows: a. Regulate government revenue and spending b. Raise tax rates c. Procuring government loans This policy can be pursued in the following ways: a.

        "paragraph": "This inflationary condition is highly avoided by the state because it will trigger mild to severe economic crises. The state must be able to prevent inflation because it can cause various kinds of problems in a country. This inflation can occur due to strong public demand or attraction to an item. Inflation occurs due to the emergence of excessive desire from a group of people who want to take advantage of more goods and services available on the market. Because of this excessive desire, the demand for demand increases, while the supply remains constant, which in turn causes prices to rise. In economics, the equilibrium price or equilibrium price or free price is the price that is formed at the meeting point of the demand curve and the supply curve. The formation of the equilibrium price and quantity in the market is the result of an agreement between the buyer (consumer) and the seller (producer) in which the quantity demanded and supplied are the same. If this balance has been reached, usually this balance point will last a long time and become a benchmark for buyers and sellers in determining prices. The demand that is formed reflects the desire of consumers, while the supply of supply reflects the desire of producers. In a perfectly competitive market, sellers and buyers have absolutely no ability to influence market prices because there is already an inner bond between sellers and buyers knowing the structure and information that exists in a perfectly competitive market. The definition of a perfectly competitive market is a market where the number of sellers and buyers (consumers) is very large and the products or goods offered or sold are of the same or similar type. Examples of goods sold in this form of market are rice, wheat, coal and potatoes. A perfectly competitive market is a market where sellers and buyers cannot influence prices so that prices in the market are really the result of agreements and interactions between supply and demand.",

The tongue is known as the sense of taste which has many taste bud structures. The tongue also helps in the act of speaking. It also helps to turn food back and forth in the mouth. Other structures associated with the tongue are often called linguals, from Latin lingua or glossal from Greek, \u03b3\u03bb\u03c9\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1. For the most part, the tongue is composed of skeletal muscle that is attached to the hyoid bone, the lower jawbone and the styloid process at the temple bone. There are two types of muscles in the tongue, namely extrinsic and intrinsic muscles. The tongue has a rough surface due to protrusions called papillae. There are three types of papillae, namely: There is one type of papillae that is not found in humans, namely the folliata papillae in rodents. The taste bud is the part of the taste bud that is on the edge of the papilla, consisting of two cells, namely supporting cells and taste buds. Taste cells function as receptors, while supporting cells serve as support. Dots or white parts on the tongue can be signs of several medical conditions: However, currently many researchers include a fifth taste, namely savory or delicious, which is found in foods with lots of protein in meat, fish and so on. These basic tastes can evolve so that we can perceive a foul or poisonous taste from bitter and sour tastes. Sweet taste helps us to introduce foods that are healthy or rich in calories, salty taste is necessary for every bodily function, and savory taste can help us identify foods that are rich in protein.

It lived around the 5th century BC, and became known in 430 BC. It is known that he was younger than Protagoras.

He also carried out the duties of ambassador of Athens. Prodikos is also known to teach rhetoric and oration techniques to many rich young men, so he gets a high fee. Due to his philosophical views which rejected Greek religion, Prodikos had to deal with the local government in Athens. Prodikos adheres to a pessimistic view of life. Death is seen as a way to escape from the hardships of human life. The fear of death is contrary to human common sense. According to Prodikos, religion is a human invention. In the beginning, humans worshiped natural forces as gods, such as the sun, moon, rivers, lakes, trees, and so on. An example is the worship of the Nile in Egypt. In the next stage, people who find certain skills are worshiped as gods. These skills include agriculture, wine growing, and iron processing. Examples of this stage are the Greek gods Demeter, Dionysos, and Hephaistos, all of whom were associated with certain skills. The prayers that humans make are seen as excessive.

By 2020, it is estimated that 1.9 billion people around the world will follow Islam, making it the second largest religion after Christianity. Muslims believe that Islam is the complete and universal version of the primordial faith that was handed down many times through previous prophets such as Adam, Abraham, Musa, and Isa (Jesus), among others; This earlier revelation was associated with Judaism and Christianity, which are considered in Islam as spiritual predecessor religions. They also consider the Quran, when preserved in Classical Arabic, as God's unchanging and final revelation to mankind. Like other Abrahamic religions, Islam also teaches about the \"Final Judgment\" where the righteous will be rewarded in heaven (Jannah) and the unrighteous will be punished in hell (Jahannam). Religious concepts and practices include the Pillars of Islam \u2014considered as obligatory worship \u2014 and following Islamic law (shari'a), which touch on almost every aspect of life, from banking and finance and welfare to the role of women and the environment. The cities of Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem are home to the three holiest sites in Islam, in descending order: the Grand Mosque, the Prophet's Mosque and Al-Aqsa Mosque, respectively. \"Islam\" in Arabic is the quadri-literal infinitive noun form (ma\u1e63dar rub\u0101\u2018\u012b).

The semantic meaning of this quadriliteral form is submission and obedience (khadha'a wa istaslama), surrender, submit, surrender (sallama), follow (atba'a), fulfill, deliver (add\u0101), or enter into peace, safety , or purity (dakhala fi al-salm au al-silm au al-sal\u0101m).",

The concept of \"surrender\" in Islam to God is not a term for fatalism, but rather as the opposite of reluctance in following religious teachings and preferring to choose an easy path in life. A Muslim follows God's commands without opposing or questioning them, but with an effort to understand his wisdom. The term \"Islam\" can also be interpreted as a religion given by God to the Prophet Muhammad as a way of salvation in this world and the hereafter whose teachings are based on monotheism and are applied in all aspects of human life. Islam is actually also used to refer to the monotheistic beliefs shared by the heavenly religions (currently Judaism and Christianity); see QS al-Maidah verse 44, QS Ali Imran verse 67 and 52. However, Islam is more popularly used for the religion brought by Muhammad as found in a verse of the Qur'an that was revealed at the end of his prophethood: Islam is a religion Allah revealed for all mankind. In it there are guidelines and rules for happiness in this world and the hereafter. There are three things that are the main links in the religion of Islam itself, namely Faith, Islam, and Ihsan. In a hadith, it is mentioned: \"From Umar bin al-Khattab RA, said: \"One day we gathered with the Messenger of Allah \ufdfa, suddenly there came a man whose clothes were very white, his hair was very black. There were no signs that he had traveled far, and none of us knew him. The man then sat in front of the Prophet \ufdfa while putting his knees on the Prophet \ufdfa's knees.",

After that I (Umar) remained silent for a few moments. Then the Messenger of Allah \ufdfa asked me, \"O Umar who is the person who came earlier? \" I replied, \"Allah and His Messenger know better.\" Then the Prophet \ufdfa said, \"Indeed that man is the Angel Gabriel AS. He came to you to teach you your religion.\" (HR. Muslim: 9) From a scientific point of view, originally the three were an undivided unity. But later the scholars made a separation, so that it became part of their own knowledge. They elaborated those parts until become a different part of knowledge. Attention to Faith brings forth the science of monotheism or the science of kalam (theology). Special attention to aspects of Islam (in a narrow sense) presents the science of jurisprudence or the science of Islamic law. While research on the dimension of Ihsan gives rise to the science of Sufism or the science of morality.

A Muslim is a person who embraces the teachings of Islam by expressing his testimony about the oneness of God and the prophethood of Muhammad. The plural form is muslimin, muslimun, or muslims. The basic concept of divinity in Islam is explained in one surah called Surah Al-Ikhlas which only consists of four verses. The first verse of this surah mentions that the One God is called Allah. The second verse explains about the ability He has as God, that is as a place to ask for everything. Then, in the third verse it is mentioned that His nature is not begetting and not being begotten. The fourth verse also mentions His nature that there is nothing like Him. In Islamic teachings. Allah is the only God who has the right to be worshiped, has the best names, and has the highest attributes and character. The teaching of Islamic monotheism is called tawhid, which is defined as God's presence in things that are God's specialty and that He obligates. The recognition of God in matters of God's particularity is divided into two discussions: tauhid rububiyyah and tauhid asma' wash-shifat, whereas the recognition of God in matters that He has made obligatory is discussed in tauhid uluhiyah. In rububiyyah monotheism, Allah is recognized as the only Rabb (the One who rules), so that everything other than Allah is 'abd (servant/slave/dominated). Allah is the Almighty Rabb in the creation, management, and government of the universe.

The name and attributes of God are known through and determined by the Qur'an and Sunnah in their literal meaning and cannot be determined by reason alone. However, God's name and attributes are not limited; apart from what is mentioned in the Qur'an and the Sunnah is kept secret in His occult knowledge. In uluhiyah monotheism, Allah is recognized as the One and Only God in all forms of worship from all His creatures. Acknowledging Allah as the only Lord has the consequence of the worship of creatures to their Lord alone. Ibadah or self-servitude to God is the act of a creature to humble oneself to Him by doing His commandments and staying away from His prohibitions for a lifetime. Worship should not be directed at anything other than Allah. Worshiping other than Allah, even though worshiping Allah, is the biggest sin in Islam which is called shirk (associating with Allah), as mentioned in His words: Allah explains about the names and divine attributes in the Quran. Remembrance and prayer are two types of worship to God that generally do not have time and place limitations. Linguistically, Zikr means remembering or mentioning. In terms, dhikr includes worship praising God, remembering His names, His favors, His decisions and destiny, His religious teachings, as well as the promise of reward and the threat of His punishment.

The essence of Islamic teachings as well as the reason for various good deeds is piety to Allah. Taqwa is the act of carrying out God's commands and abandoning His prohibitions based on fear, hope, and love for God. A Muslim worships God also in order to hope to enter heaven and avoid hell.

Little is known about his early life biography; the more numerous are the chronicles of his life after becoming a prophet and apostle at the age of forty in 610. The Koran is the main source of information about the life of the Prophet Muhammad. Besides that, the hadith and sirah nabawi (the history of prophetic life) further describe his position and role in the early days of Islam. Muhammad acts as a recipient of revelation from Allah and at the same time as a role model for all Muslims to try to imitate him. Muhammad bin Abdullah (son of Abdullah) was born in 570 AD in Mecca (now in Saudi Arabia). c] His father who was a trader died before his birth. His mother, Aminah, died when Muhammad was six years old. In his early youth, Muhammad did not have a steady job in Mecca, which was a thriving trading city; many say he worked as a goat herder. At the age of 25, Muhammad was hired by a rich widow, Khadijah bint Khuwailid, to oversee the transportation of his trade to the Sham region (now including Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and Palestine). Muhammad impressed Khadija with the results of his work which brought in profits that he had never before received so much - as well as the description of Khadijah's maid who accompanied the trading trip about Muhammad's behavior - until Khadijah offered to marry Muhammad.",

Mecca was a center of trade prosperity. However, the community is a tribal society that is easily conflicted. Some of the events that show this, which also involved Muhammad, are the Battle of Fujjar, Hilful Fudul, and the renovation of the Kaaba and the removal of the Black Stone. These events and other sociological conditions also influenced Muhammad, who became a successful person in the Meccan community. He was respected for his trustworthiness and judgment on disputes; he was known by his title al-Am\u012bn, \"the trustworthy one\". That honesty is complete with his penchant for contemplation which eventually made him used to being alone in the Cave of Hira'\u2013which is nearly two miles north of Mecca\u2013when he was approaching forty years of age. Here, in a long time of seclusion, he reflects on his life and the ills afflicting his society. Here, at the age of fortieth in the month of Ramadan, on a night called Lailatul Qadar, \u201cthe night of glory\u201d, Muhammad received his first revelations from Allah through the intermediary of the Angel Gabriel.

It is not an easy matter to preach the message about God Almighty in the city of Mecca because this city is a religious center. Muhammad began his preaching secretly for three years to avoid things that would provoke the anger of the people of Mecca. Among the first to accept his invitation were Ali bin Abi Talib, his cousin and son-in-law who was still a child at the time, and Abu Bakar, his later father-in-law and the first caliph.

The Prophet Muhammad denounced fraudulent transactions, usury, and neglect and exploitation of widows and orphans. He defended the rights of the poor and the oppressed, stressing that the rich had a duty to the poor. As a form of commitment to this obligation, zakat is determined on agricultural and plantation assets and products. Just like Amos and Jeremiah before him, Muhammad was a \"warner\" from God to admonish his listeners to repent and fear Him, because the day of judgment was near: At first, the Meccans only tried to keep people from outside Mecca from hearing preaching and put up verbal resistance with arguments and reproaches. The deaths of his uncle and protector, Abu Talib, and Khadija in 619 added to his grief. The resistance escalated from acts of persecution to mass boycotts. Because conditions in Mecca worsened, Muhammad allowed his followers to migrate outside of Mecca, such as Habasyah (Ethiopia) which was a Christian area, for safety.

The extent of the spread of Islam and the division of the caliphate that began in the 8th century, led to the emergence of various separate authorities in the form of \"sultanates\"; for example the Safavid Sultanate, the Seljuk Turkish Sultanate, the Mughal Sultanate, the Samudera Pasai Sultanate and the Malacca Sultanate, which have become sultanates with strong and well-known powers in the world.",

The Ottoman Empire (Ottoman Empire), which was nominally considered the last Islamic caliphate, finally collapsed after World War I. The Ottoman Empire at that time was led by Sultan Muhammad V. Because it was considered less assertive by young Turks led by Mustafa Kemal Pasha or Kemal Atat\u00fcrk, the royal system was overhauled and replaced with a republic. The pioneers of Islamic modernism influenced Islamic political movements such as the Muslim Brotherhood and related parties in the Arab world, which performed well in elections after the Arab Spring, Jamaat-e-Islami in South Asia and the AK Party, which democratically ruled Turkey for decades. . In Iran, the revolution replaced the secular monarchy with an Islamic state. Others such as Rashid Ridha broke away from Islamic modernists and pushed against embracing what he saw as Western influences. While some are silent, others believe in violence against those who oppose them even other Muslims, such as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, who will even try to reinvent the modern gold dinar as their monetary system. However any Muslim or Islamic state recognizes ISIS as Muslim but instead they are seen as extremists or terrorists. Against Islamic political movements, in 20th century Turkey, the military staged a coup to overthrow Islamic governments, and the headscarf was restricted by law, as was also the case in Tunisia. Elsewhere religious power is co-opted, such as in Saudi Arabia, where the state has a monopoly on religious knowledge and is often seen as a puppet of the state while Egypt nationalized Al-Azhar University, previously a power of independent sound-checking status.",

The globalization of communication has increased the dissemination of religious information. Adoption of the headscarf has grown more common and some Muslim intellectuals are increasingly trying to separate scriptural Islamic beliefs from cultural traditions. Among other groups, this access to information has led to the rise of popular \"televangelical\" preachers, such as Amr Khaled, who compete with traditional clerics in their reach and have decentralized religious authority.

This element, also known as nitrogen, was first discovered and isolated by the Scottish physician Daniel Rutherford in 1772. Although Carl Wilhelm Scheele and Henry Cavendish separately had doing the same thing around the same time, Rutherford was generally fit to receive the award because his work was published first. The name nitrogen was suggested by Jean-Antoine-Claude Chaptal in 1790, when he discovered that nitrogen is present in nitric and nitric acids; the name is derived from the Greek: \u03bd\u1f30\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd \"nitre\" and -\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03bd\u1fb6\u03bd \"to form\".

Nitrogen is the lightest member of group 15 of the periodic table, and is often called a pnictogen.

Nitrogen is a common element in the universe, estimated to be 7th in total abundance in the Milky Way galaxy and the Solar System. At standard temperature and pressure, two atoms of the element bond to form dinitrogen, a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the chemical formula N2. Dinitrogen makes up about 78% of Earth's atmosphere, making it the most abundant element on its own.

The nitrogen cycle describes the movement of elements from the air, into the biosphere and organic compounds, and then back into the atmosphere. Many compounds of industrial importance, such as ammonia, nitric acid, organic nitrates (propellants and explosives), and cyanides, contain nitrogen. The very strong triple bond in elementary nitrogen (N\u2261N), the second strongest bond in diatomic molecules after carbon monoxide (CO), dominates nitrogen chemistry. This causes difficulties for both organisms and industry in converting N2 into useful compounds, but at the same time, burning, detonating, or decomposing nitrogen compounds to form nitrogen gas releases large amounts of energy which are often beneficial. Synthetic ammonia and nitrates are the main industrial fertilizers, and nitrate fertilizers are the main pollutants in the eutrophication of water systems. Apart from its use as a fertilizer and energy storage, nitrogen is a constituent of many organic compounds such as Kevlar which is used in high tenacity fabrics and cyanoacrylate which is used in superglue. Nitrogen is a constituent of all major pharmacological drug classes, including antibiotics. Many drugs or prodrugs mimic natural nitrogen-containing signaling molecules: for example, the organic nitrates nitroglycerin and nitroprusside control blood pressure by metabolizing them to nitrous monoxide. Many important nitrogen-containing drugs, such as caffeine and natural morphine or synthetic amphetamine, act as receptor neurotransmitters in animals.

Although he did not recognize it as an entirely different chemical substance, he did distinguish it from Joseph Black's \"fixed air,\" or carbon dioxide. The fact that there was a component of air that did not support combustion was clear enough to Rutherford, even though he did not realize it was an element. Nitrogen was also studied at the same time by Carl Wilhelm Scheele, Henry Cavendish, and Joseph Priestley, who referred to it as combustible or phlogisticated air. Nitrogen gas is sufficiently inert that it was referred to by Antoine Lavoisier as \"mephytic air\" or azote, from the Greek: \u03ac\u03b6\u03c9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 (azoticos), \"non-living\".

Early applications of nitrogen compounds in military, industrial, and agricultural fields included saltpeter (sodium nitrate or potassium nitrate), most importantly in gunpowder, and later as a fertilizer. In 1910, Lord Rayleigh discovered that an electric discharge in nitrogen gas produces \"active nitrogen\", a monoatomic allotrope of nitrogen. The \"swirling clouds of brilliant yellow light\" produced by his apparatus reacted with mercury to produce mercury nitride. For a long time, sources of nitrogen compounds were limited. Natural resources are derived from biological or nitrate deposits produced by atmospheric reactions. Nitrogen fixation by industrial processes such as the Frank\u2013Caro process (1895-1899) and the Haber\u2013Bosch process (1908-1913) alleviated the shortage of nitrogen compounds, with up to half of global food production (see applications) now depending on synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. At the same time, the use of the Ostwald process (1902) to produce nitrate from industrial nitrogen fixation made possible the large-scale industrial production of nitrate as a feedstock in the manufacture of explosives during the 20th century World Wars. The nitrogen atom has seven electrons. In the ground state, they are regular in the electron configuration 1s22s22p1x2p1y2p1z. Therefore, there are five valence electrons in the 2s and 2p orbitals, three of which (p electrons) are unpaired.

The first three ionization energies of nitrogen are 1.402 each; 2,856; and 4.577 MJ mol-1, and the sum of the fourth and fifth ionization energies is 16.920 MJ mol-1. Nitrogen has no simple cation chemistry, because of this very high number. The lack of a radial node in the 2p subshell is directly responsible for many of the anomalous properties of the first row of p-blocks, especially in nitrogen, oxygen, and fluorine. The 2p subshell is very small and has a very similar radius to the 2s shell, thus facilitating orbital hybridization. This also results in a very large electrostatic attraction between the nucleus and the valence electrons in the 2s and 2p shells, resulting in a very high electronegativity. Hypervalence is almost unknown in 2p elements for the same reason, because its high electronegativity makes it difficult for the small nitrogen atom to become the central atom in an electron-rich three-center four-electron bond because it would tend to attract electrons strongly to itself. Thus, apart from nitrogen's position at the head of group 15 of the periodic table, its chemistry shows vast differences from its heavier congeners phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth. Nitrogen can be useful in comparison with its horizontal neighbors carbon and oxygen and its vertical neighbors in the pyctogen column (phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth). Although each of the period 2 elements from lithium to nitrogen shows some resemblance to the period 3 elements in the next group from magnesium to sulfur (known as a diagonal relationship), their degree drops abruptly across the boron-silicon pair, resulting in nitrogen's similarity to sulfur. mostly confined to sulfur nitride ring compounds when only one of the two elements is present.",

One property of nitrogen that it shares with its two horizontal neighbors is its characteristic form of forming multiple bonds, usually with carbon, nitrogen, or oxygen atoms, through p\u03c0\u2013p\u03c0 interactions; thus, for example, nitrogen occurs as a diatomic molecule and therefore has much lower melting (\u2212210\u00b0C) and boiling (\u2212196\u00b0C) than the rest of the group, since the N2 molecules are only held together by van Der Waals interactions weak and there are only a few electrons available to instantly create a significant dipole. This property is impossible for its vertical neighbours; thus, the compounds nitrogen oxides, nitrites, nitrates, nitro-, nitroso-, azo-, and diazo-, azides, cyanates, thiocyanates, and imino derivatives do not resonate with phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, or bismuth. In the same way, however, the complexity of oxophosphorous acids does not echo with nitrogen. Nitrogen has two stable isotopes: 14N and 15N. The first isotope is much more common, making up 99.634% of natural nitrogen, and the second (which is slightly heavier) makes up 0.366%. This causes its atomic weight to be about 14.007 u. Both of these stable isotopes are produced via the CNO cycle in stars, but 14N is more common because its neutron capture is the rate-limiting step. 14N is one of the five stable odd\u2013odd nuclides (a nuclide with an odd number of protons and neutrons); the other four are 2H, 6Li, 10B, and 180mTa.

Naud\u00e9 in 1929, shortly after the discovery of heavy isotopes of the neighboring elements oxygen and carbon. It presents one of the lowest thermal neutron capture of all isotopes. 15N is often used in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to determine the structure of nitrogen-containing molecules, because its fractional nuclear spin is one-half, which offers advantages for NMR such as narrower line widths. 14N, although theoretically also usable, has a spherical nuclear spin and thus a quadrupol moment which leads to a wider and less useful spectrum. 15N NMR still has complications that are not found in the higher NMR spectroscopy, 1H and 13C. The low natural abundance of 15N (0.36%) significantly reduces sensitivity, a problem only exacerbated by the low gyromagnetic ratio, (only 10.14% of 1H). As a result, the signal-to-noise ratio for 1H is about 300 times greater than for 15N at the same magnetic field strength. This can be reduced somewhat by enrichment of the 15N isotope via chemical exchange or fractional distillation. Compounds enriched with 15N have the advantage that under standard conditions, they do not undergo a chemical exchange of their nitrogen atoms with nitrogen in the atmosphere, unlike compounds with labeled isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen which must be removed from the atmosphere. The 15N:14N ratio is commonly used in stable isotope analysis in geochemistry, hydrology, paleoclimatology and paleoceanography, which is called \u03b415N. Of the ten other isotopes produced synthetically, ranging from 12N to 23N, 13N has a half-life of ten minutes and the remaining isotopes have half-lives in the range of seconds (16N and 17N) or even milliseconds.",

Radioisotope 16N is the predominant radionuclide in the coolant of pressurized water reactors or boiling water reactors during normal operation, and as such it is a sensitive and rapid indicator of leakage from the main cooling system to the secondary vapor cycle, and is the primary means of detecting such leaks. 16N is produced from 16O (in water) in a (n,p) reaction in which the 16O atom captures a neutron and releases a proton. It has a short half-life of about 7.1 seconds, but during decay returns to 16O to produce high-energy gamma radiation (5 to 7 MeV). Therefore, access to the primary coolant piping in a pressurized water reactor must be restricted while the generating reactor is in operation. Atomic nitrogen, also known as active nitrogen, is highly reactive, having a triradical shape with three unpaired electrons. Free nitrogen atoms readily react with most elements to form nitrides, and even when two free-nitrogen atoms collide to produce excited N2 molecules, they can release a great deal of energy on collision with stable molecules such as carbon dioxide and water to cause homolytic fission which results in radicals such as CO and O or OH and H.

Dinitrogen is relatively unreactive at room temperature, but it does react with lithium metal and some transition metal complexes.

The triple bond has a short bond length (in this case, 109.76\u00a0pm) and a high dissociation energy (in this case, 945.41 kJ/mol), so it is very strong. This explains the chemical inertness of dinitrogen. There are some theoretical indications that oligomers and other nitrogenous polymers are possible. If they could be synthesized, they might have potential applications as materials with very high energy densities, which could be used as powerful propellant or explosives. This is because everything must break down into dinitrogen, whose N\u2261N triple bond (bond energy 946\u00a0kJ\u22c5mol\u22121) is much stronger than the N=N double bond (418 kJ\u22c5mol\u22121) or N\u2013N single bonds (160 kJ\u22c5mol\u22121): indeed, a triple bond has more than three times the energy of a single bond.

Therefore, ammonia undergoes self-dissociation, similar to water, to give ammonium and amides. Ammonia burns in air or oxygen, though not readily, to produce nitrogen gas; it burns in fluorine with a yellow-green flame to give nitrogen trifluoride. Reactions with other non-metals are very complex and tend to form mixtures of products. Ammonia reacts on heating with metals to form nitrides. Many other binary nitrogen hydrides are known, but the most important are hydrazine (N) and hydrogen azide (HN3).

Hydrogen azide can be considered as the conjugate acid of the azide anion, and is analogous to hydrogen halide. All four simple nitrogen trihalides are known.

Like carbon tetrachloride, nitrogen trifluoride is completely unreactive and stable in dilute solutions of acids or bases. Only when heated does it act as a fluorinating agent, and reacts with copper, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth at high temperatures to form tetrafluorohydrazine (N).

NCl3 was first synthesized by Pierre Louis Dulong in 1811, who lost three fingers and an eye due to its tendency to be explosive.

Nitrogen tribromide (NBr3), first prepared in 1975, is a dark red, temperature-sensitive, volatile solid that is explosive even at \u2212100\u00b0C. Nitrogen triiodide (NI3) is more unstable and was only prepared once in 1990. Its adduct with ammonia, which was known before, is very sensitive to shock: it can be exploded by feathers, wind, or even alpha particles. For this reason, small amounts of nitrogen triiodide are sometimes synthesized for demonstrations in high school chemistry courses or for \"chemical magic tricks\". Two groups of nitrogen oxohalides are known: nitrosyl halides (XNO) and nitrile halides (XNO2). XNO is a highly reactive gas that can be prepared by the direct halogenation of dinitrogen monoxide.

Despite this, nitrogen is not very abundant in the Earth's crust, present at only 19 parts per million, on a par with niobium, gallium and lithium. The only important nitrogenous minerals are niter (potassium nitrate, saltpeter) and sodaniter (sodium nitrate, Chilean saltpeter). However, they have ceased to be an important source of nitrates since the 1920s, when industrial-scale synthesis of ammonia and nitric acid became commonplace. Nitrogen compounds are constantly exchanged between the atmosphere and living organisms. Nitrogen must first be processed, or \"fixed\", into a form that can be used by plants, usually ammonia. Some nitrogen fixation occurs as a result of lightning strikes producing nitrogen oxides, but most is carried out by diazotropic bacteria via enzymes known as nitrogenases (although industrial nitrogen fixation to ammonia is also significant nowadays). When ammonia is taken up by plants, it is used to synthesize proteins. The plants are then eaten by animals which use nitrogen compounds to synthesize their own proteins and excrete nitrogen-rich feces. Eventually, these organisms die and decompose, undergoing bacterial and environmental oxidation and denitrification, returning free nitrogen to the atmosphere. Industrial nitrogen fixation by the Haber process is mostly used as a fertilizer, although excess nitrogen-rich waste, when leached, causes eutrophication of freshwater and the formation of aquatic dead zones, since nitrogen-driven bacterial growth depresses water oxygen to the point where all higher organisms die.",

In animals, nitrogen oxide free radicals (derived from amino acids) serve as regulatory molecules important for circulation. The rapid reaction of nitrogen oxides with water in animals produces nitrite products in their metabolites. Protein nitrogen metabolism in animals, in general, ends in the excretion of urea, while nucleic acid metabolism in animals leads to the excretion of urea and uric acid. The characteristic odor of decaying animal meat is caused by the formation of long-chain amines, such as tetra- and pentamethylenediamine, which are products of the breakdown of the amino acids ornithine and lysine, in protein breakdown. Nitrogen gas is an industrial gas produced by fractional distillation of liquefied air, or by mechanical means using air as raw material (pressure reverse osmosis membrane or pressure swing absorption).

Commercial nitrogen is often a by-product of air treatment for industrial concentration of oxygen for steel processing and other uses.

The common people refer to most members of the fungi as mushrooms, molds, yeasts, or yeasts, although it is often the external appearance that is visible, not the species itself. The difficulty in recognizing fungi is more or less due to the alternation of offspring that have completely different appearances (remember metamorphosis in insects or frogs). Fungi reproduce both sexually and asexually. Sexual propagation is by means of: two hyphae from different fungi fuse and form a zygote, then the zygote grows into a fruiting body, while asexual propagation is by forming spores, budding or fragmentation of hyphae. Fungi have a spore box called a sporangium. Inside the sporangium are spores. An example of a fungus that forms spores is Rhizopus. An example of a fungus that forms buds is Saccharomyces. Fungal hyphae can collapse and individual fragments can grow into fruiting bodies.

Most grow in terrestrial environments, although a few species live partially or completely in aquatic habitats, such as the fungus Chytridiomycota Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, a parasite that has been responsible for declining amphibian populations worldwide. This organism spends part of its life cycle as a motile zoospore, enabling it to propel itself through water and enter an amphibian host. Another example of aquatic fungi are those that live in the hydrothermal areas of the sea. About 120,000 species of fungi have been described by taxonomists, but the global biodiversity of the fungal kingdom is not fully understood. 2017 estimates suggest there may be between 2.2 and 3.8 million species. In mycology, species have historically been distinguished by various methods and concepts. Classification based on morphological characteristics, such as spore size and shape or fruit structure, has traditionally dominated the taxonomy of fungi. Species can also be distinguished by their biochemical and physiological characteristics, such as their ability to metabolize certain chemical substances, or their reactions to chemical tests. The biological species concept distinguishes species based on their ability to mate. The application of molecular tools, such as DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, to study fungal diversity has greatly increased the resolution and added strength to estimates of genetic diversity within various taxonomic groups. Mycology is a branch of biology concerned with the systematic study of fungi, including their genetic and biochemical properties, their taxonomy and their use by humans as a source of drugs, foods and psychotropic substances consumed for religious purposes, as well as their hazards, such as poisoning or infection.",

        "paragraph": "Phytopathology, the study of plant diseases, is closely related because many plant pathogens are fungi. Fungi have been used by humans since prehistoric times; \u00d6tzi, a well-preserved 5,300-year-old Neolithic male mummy found frozen in the Austrian Alps, carries two species of polypore fungi that may have been used as tinder (Fomes fomentarius), or medicinally (Piptoporus Betulinus). Ancient peoples had used fungi as a food source\u2014often unknowingly\u2014for thousands of years, in the preparation of leavened bread and fermented juices. Some of the oldest written records contain references to possible plant destruction by fungal pathogens. Mycology is a relatively new science that became systematic after the invention of the microscope in the 17th century. Although fungal spores were first observed by Giambattista della Porta in 1588, work considered a pioneer in the development of mycology was the publication Nova plantarum genera in 1729 by Pier Antonio Micheli. Micheli not only observed spores but also demonstrated that, under the right conditions, spores can be induced to grow into the same species of fungus as the species from which they originated. Expanding on the use of the binomial nomenclature system introduced by Carolus Linnaeus in his Species plantarum (1753), the Dutchman Christian Hendrik Persoon (1761-1836) established the first classification of fungi so skillfully that he is considered the founder of modern mycology. Later, Elias Magnus Fries (1794\u20131878) further elaborated on the classification of fungi, using color and the microscopic characteristics of spores, methods still used by taxonomists today. Other important early contributors to mycology in the 17th\u201319th and early 20th centuries include Miles Joseph Berkeley, August Carl Joseph Corda, Anton de Bary, brothers Louis Ren\u00e9 and Charles Tulasne, Arthur H. R. Buller, Curtis G. Lloyd, and Pier Andrea Saccardo.",

The use of DNA sequencing technologies and phylogenetic analysis has provided new insights into the relationships and biodiversity of fungi, and has challenged traditional morphology-based groupings in fungal taxonomy. Most fungi grow as hyphae, cylindrical, thread-like structures 2\u201310 \u00b5m in diameter and up to several centimeters long. Hyphae grow at the tip (apex); New hyphae are usually formed by the appearance of new ends along existing hyphae by a process called branching, or sometimes the growing hyphae tips branch in half, giving rise to two parallel growing hyphae. Hyphae also sometimes fuse when they touch, a process called hyphal fusion (or anastomosis). This growth process leads to the development of the mycelium, a network of interconnected hyphae. Hyphae may be septate or senocytic. Septate hyphae are divided into chambers separated by cross walls (internal cell walls, called septa, which form perpendicular to the cell walls that give the hypha its shape), with each chamber containing one or more nuclei; senocytic hyphae are not divided into chambers. Septa have pores that allow cytoplasm, organelles, and sometimes nuclei to pass through; an example is the septum dolipore in fungi from the phylum Basidiomycota. Senositic hyphae are essentially multinucleate supercells. Many species have developed specialized hyphal structures for nutrient uptake from living hosts; for example haustoria in plant-parasitic species of most fungal phyla, and arbuscules of some mycorrhizal fungi, which penetrate into host cells to consume nutrients. Although fungi are Opisthokonta\u2014an evolutionarily related group of organisms broadly characterized by a single posterior flagellum\u2014all phyla except Chytridiomycota have lost their posterior flagella.",

Each fungus belongs to the same category which is differentiated by the type of spore, the morphology of the hyphae and the sexual cycle. Fungal mycelia can be seen with the naked eye, for example, on various surfaces and substrates, such as damp walls and rotting food, commonly called mold. Mycelia grown on solid agar media in laboratory petri dishes are usually referred to as colonies. These colonies may exhibit growth patterns and colors (due to spores or pigmentation) that can be used as diagnostic features in species or group identification. Some individual fungal colonies can reach extraordinary dimensions and ages as in the case of the Armillaria solidipes colony, which spans an area of \u200b\u200bover 900 ha (3.5 square miles), with an estimated age of nearly 9,000 years. The apotechium\u2014a specialized structure important in sexual reproduction in the Ascomycota\u2014is a cup-shaped fruiting body that is often macroscopic in size and carries a hymenium, a layer of tissue containing spore-bearing cells. The fruit bodies of Basidiomycota (basidiokarp) and some Ascomycota can sometimes grow very large, and many are known as mushrooms (mushroom). Macroscopic mushrooms are also very useful for humans because several types of mushrooms have been proven to be used as food ingredients and medicines for various diseases. Fungal growth as hyphae on or in solid substrates or as single cells in aquatic environments is adapted to extract nutrients efficiently, because this growth form has a high surface area to volume ratio.

        "paragraph": "Hyphae can exert great mechanical force for penetration; for example, many plant pathogens, including Magnaporthe grisea, form structures called apresorium which evolved into skewers in plant tissue. The pressure exerted by the appressorium, which is directed at the plant epidermis, can exceed 8 megapascals (1,200 psi). The filamentous fungus Paecilomyces lilacinus uses the same structure to penetrate nematode eggs. The mechanical stress exerted by the appressorium results from physiological processes that increase intracellular turgor by producing osmolytes such as glycerol. Such adaptations are complemented by hydrolytic enzymes secreted into the environment to digest large organic molecules\u2014such as polysaccharides, proteins, and lipids\u2014into smaller molecules that can then be absorbed as nutrients. Most filamentous fungi grow polarly (extending in one direction) by extending at the apex of the hyphae. Other forms of fungal growth include intercalary extension (longitudinal expansion of the hyphal compartment below the apex) as in the case of some endophytic fungi, or growth by volume expansion during the development of fungal stypes and other large organs. Growth of fungi as multicellular structures composed of somatic and reproductive cells\u2014a feature that develops independently in animals and plants\u2014serves several functions, including the development of fruiting bodies for sexual spore dispersal (see above) and biofilms for substrate colonization and cell-to-cell communication. Fungi have traditionally been considered as heterotrophs, organisms that rely solely on carbon fixed by other organisms for metabolism. Fungi have evolved a high degree of metabolic flexibility that allows them to use a variety of organic substrates for growth, including simple compounds such as nitrate, ammonia, acetate, or ethanol. In some species, the pigment melanin may play a role in extracting energy from ionizing radiation, such as gamma radiation.",

This process may be similar to CO2 fixation using visible light, but using ionizing radiation as an energy source. The reproduction of fungi is extremely complex, reflecting the differences in lifestyles and genetic makeup within this diverse kingdom of organisms. It is estimated that one-third of all fungi reproduce using more than one propagation method; for example, reproduction may occur in two well-differentiated stages in the life cycle of a species, teleomorph and anamorph. Environmental conditions trigger genetically determined developmental states that lead to the formation of specialized structures for sexual or asexual reproduction. These structures aid reproduction by efficiently dispersing spores or spore-bearing propagules. Asexual reproduction occurs via vegetative spores (conidia) or through fragmentation of the mycelium. Mycelial fragmentation occurs when the fungal mycelium separates into several pieces, and each part grows into a separate mycelium. Mycelial fragmentation and vegetative spores maintain niche-adapted clone populations, and allow for more rapid dispersal than sexual reproduction. \"Fungi imperfecti\" (fungi lacking a perfect or sexual stage) or Deuteromycota comprises all species that lack an observable sexual cycle. Deuteromycota is not an accepted taxonomic clade, and is now considered to mean only fungi that have no known sexual stage. Sexual reproduction by meiosis has been directly observed in all fungal phyla except Glomeromycota (genetic analysis suggests meiosis may also occur in Glomeromycota). It differs in many aspects from sexual reproduction in animals or plants. Differences also exist between groups of fungi and can be used to distinguish species with morphological differences in sexual structure and reproductive strategies.",

        "paragraph": "Mating experiments between fungal isolates can identify species based on the concept of biological species. The main fungal groups were initially described on the basis of their sexual spore and structural morphology; for example, structures containing the spores, ascus and basidium, can be used in the identification of Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, respectively. Fungi use two mating systems: heterothallic species allow mating only between individuals of opposite mating types, whereas homothallic species can mate, and reproduce sexually, with other individuals or themselves. Most fungi have haploid and diploid stages in their life cycle. In sexually reproducing fungi, suitable individuals may join by joining their hyphae together into interconnected tissues; this process, anastomosis, is necessary for the initiation of the sexual cycle. Many Ascomycota and Basidiomycota go through a dikaryotic stage, in which nuclei inherited from the two parents do not merge immediately after cell fusion, but remain separate within the hyphal cells (see heterokaryosis). In Ascomycota, the dikaryotic hyphae of the hymenium (spore-bearing tissue layer) form a characteristic hook on the hyphal septum. During cell division, hook formation ensures proper distribution of the newly dividing nuclei to the apical and basal hyphal compartments. Ascus is then formed, where karyogamy (nuclear fusion) occurs. The ascus is embedded in the ascocarp, or fruiting body. Karyogamy within the ascus is soon followed by meiosis and production of ascospores. After dispersal, the ascospores can germinate and form a new haploid mycelium. Sexual reproduction in Basidiomycota is similar to Ascomycota. Matched haploid hyphae coalesce to produce a dikaryotic mycelium. However, the dikaryotic phase is more abundant in Basidiomycota, often also present in vegetatively growing mycelium. Special anatomical structures, called clamp connections, are formed at each hyphal septum.",

        "paragraph": "As with the structurally similar hooks in the Ascomycota, the clamp connections in the Basidiomycota are necessary for controlled nuclear transfer during cell division, to maintain the dikaryotic stage with two genetically distinct nuclei in each hyphal compartment. A basidiocarp is formed within which there are club-like structures known as basidia which produce haploid basidiospores after karyogamy and meiosis. The best known basidiocarps are fungi, but basidiocarps can take other forms (see Morphology section). In fungi formerly classified as Zygomycota, the haploid hyphae of two individuals fuse, forming the gametangium, a specialized cell structure that becomes the fertile gamete-producing cell. Gametangia develop into zygospores, thick-walled spores formed by the union of gametes. When the zygospore germinates, it undergoes meiosis, producing new haploid hyphae, which can then form asexual sporangiospores. These sporangiospores allow the fungus to spread rapidly and germinate into new, genetically identical, haploid fungal mycelia. Both asexual and sexual spores or sporangiospores are often actively dispersed by forced ejection of their reproductive structures. This ejection ensures the exit of the spores from the reproductive structures as well as long distance travel by air. Special mechanical and physiological mechanisms, as well as spore surface structures (such as hydrophobin), allow efficient spore ejection. For example, the spore-bearing cells of some Ascomycota species have structures that cause the accumulation of substances that affect cell volume and fluid balance, allowing the explosive release of spores into the air. The forced ejection of a single spore called a ballistospore involves the formation of a drop of water (Buller's drop), which when touching the spore causes the release of a projectile with an initial acceleration of over 10,000 g; the end result is that the spores are expelled 0.01-0.02\u00a0cm, a distance sufficient to fall through the gills or pores into the air below.",

        "paragraph": "Other fungi, such as puffball, rely on alternative mechanisms to release spores, such as external mechanical forces. Bird's nest mushrooms use the force of falling water droplets to release spores from cup-shaped fruiting bodies. Another strategy exists in stinkhorns, fungi with bright colors and a foul odor that attract insects to spread their spores. The most common mode of spore dispersal is by wind\u2013species that use this form of dispersion often produce dry or hydrophobic spores that do not absorb water and are easily dispersed by raindrops, for example. Most of the studied fungal species produce spores that are carried by the wind. In addition to normal sexual reproduction by meiosis, certain fungi, such as those in the genera Penicillium and Aspergillus, can exchange genetic material by a parasexual process, initiated by anastomoses between hyphae and plasmogamy of fungal cells. The frequency and relative importance of parasexual occurrences is unclear and may be lower than that of other sexual processes. Parasexual processes are known to play a role in intraspecific hybridization and may be necessary for interspecies hybridization, which has been linked to major events in the evolution of fungi. In contrast to plants and animals, the fossil record of early fungi is scanty. Factors that likely contributed to the underrepresentation of fungal species among fossils include the nature of the fruiting bodies of fungi, which are soft and biodegradable tissues and the microscopic dimensions of most fungal structures, which are therefore not easy to prove. Fossil fungi are difficult to distinguish from other microbes, and are easiest to identify when they resemble living fungi.

The earliest fossils bearing the hallmarks of fungi are from the Paleoproterozoic era, about 2,400 million years ago (mya); These multicellular benthic organisms have filamentous structures capable of anastomoses. Another study (2009) estimated the emergence of fungi at around 760-1,060 mya based on comparisons of evolution rates in closely related groups. During most of the Paleozoic Era (542\u2013251 mya), fungi appear to have been aquatic and consisted of organisms similar to the surviving Chytridiomycota in that they have flagellated spores. Evolutionary adaptation from an aquatic to a terrestrial lifestyle requires a diversification of ecological strategies for obtaining nutrition, including parasitism, saprobism, and the development of mutualistic relationships such as mycorrhiza and lichenization. A study in 2009 showed that the ancestral ecological state of the Ascomycota was saprobism, and that independent lichenization events had occurred several times. Fungi in classical taxonomy in ordinary schools are grouped as divisio into five classes: The division above has been considered obsolete because recent findings have made fungi elevated to a separate Kingdom of organisms (Regnum), with a separate division/phylum: Phylum Blastocladiomycota Phylum Chytridiomycota Phylum Glomeromycota Phylum Microsporidia Phylum Neocallimastigomycota Subregnum : Dikarya (term. Deuteromycota), includes Phylum Ascomycota Phylum Basidiomycota Sub-phylum incertae sedis (including Dikarya whose phylum has not yet been determined) Deuteromycota is a group for fungi that cannot yet be classified in the four phyla above (status \"unclear\", incertae sedis) . Lichens or Lichens are not individuals, but a form of close mutualism symbiosis between fungi and algae.

        "paragraph": "Along with bacteria, fungi are the main decomposers in most terrestrial (and some aquatic) ecosystems, and therefore play an important role in biogeochemical cycles and in many food webs. As decomposers, fungi play an important role in nutrient cycling, especially as saprotrophs and symbionts, decomposing organic matter into inorganic molecules, which can then re-enter the anabolic metabolic pathways in plants or other organisms. Many fungi have important symbiotic relationships with organisms from most if not all of the Kingdom. This interaction can be protagonist or antagonistic, or in the case of commensal functions, it is neither beneficial nor detrimental to the host. The mycorrhizal symbiosis between plants and fungi is one of the best known plant-fungal associations and is essential for plant growth and survival in many ecosystems; more than 90% of all plant species engage in mycorrhizal relationships with fungi and depend on these relationships for reproduction. Mycorrhizal symbiosis dates back at least 400 million years. Mycorrhiza enhances plant uptake of inorganic compounds, such as nitrate and phosphate, from soils that have low concentrations of these key plant nutrients. Fungi can also mediate the transfer of carbohydrates and other nutrients from plant to plant. Such mycorrhizal communities are called \"common mycorrhizal networks\". A special case of mycorrhiza is myco-heterotrophy, in which a plant parasitizes a fungus, obtaining all of its nutrients from the fungal symbiont. Some species of fungi inhabit the tissues in roots, stems and leaves, in which case they are called endophytes. Similar to mycorrhizae, endophytic colonization by fungi can benefit both symbionts; for example, grass endophytes provide their hosts with increased resistance to herbivory and other environmental pressures and receive food and protection from plants in return.",

In its broadest sense, it is the belief that there is no god or God in existence. The term atheism comes from the Greek \u1f04\u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03c2 (\u00e1theos), which is pejoratively used to refer to anyone whose beliefs conflict with the established religion/belief in their environment. With the spread of free thought, scientific skepticism, and criticism of religion, the term atheist began to be specified to refer to those who did not believe in god. The first self-proclaimed \"atheist\" appeared in the 18th century. Today, about 2.3% of the world's population identify as atheists, while 11.9% identify as nontheists. About 65% of Japan's population identify as atheists, agnostics, or people with no religion; and about 48% in Russia. The percentage of such communities in the European Union ranges from 6% (Italy) to 85% (Sweden). Many atheists are skeptical of the existence of paranormal phenomena due to a lack of empirical evidence. Others provide arguments with philosophical, social, or historical grounds. In Western culture, atheists are often seen as irreligious. Some schools of Buddhism never mention the term 'God' in various ritual ceremonies, but in Buddhism the concept of divinity in question uses the term Nirvana. Therefore this religion is often called an atheistic religion. Although many who define themselves as atheists lean toward secular philosophies such as humanism, rationalism, and naturalism, there is no specific ideology or behavior that all atheists espouse.",

The word began to refer to the intentional and active rejection of god in the 5th century BC, with the definition of \"cutting off from god/gods\" or \"rejecting god/gods\". Modern translations of the classical texts sometimes render atheos as \"atheistic\". As an abstract noun, there is also \u1f00\u03b8\u03b5\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 (atheot\u0113s), which means \"atheism\". Cicero transliterated the Greek word into Latin atheos. This term was often used in debates between early Christians and followers of the Ancient Greek (Hellenic) religion, in which each side referred to the other as atheists pejoratively. Atheism was first used to refer to \"separate belief\" in the late 18th century in Europe, primarily referring to the disbelief in a monotheistic God. In the 20th century, globalization broadened the definition of this term to refer to \"non-belief in all gods\", although it is still common to refer to atheism as \"monotheism\". Recently, there has been a push within certain philosophical groups to redefine atheism as the \"absence of belief in a god/goddess\", rather than atheism as a belief in itself. This definition is very popular among the atheist community, although its use is still very limited. Authors differ in defining and classifying atheism, namely whether atheism is a belief in itself or simply the absence of belief, and whether atheism requires conscious and explicit rejection. Various categories have been proposed to try to distinguish the different forms of atheism. Some of the ambiguity and controversy involved in defining atheism lies in the difficulty of reaching a consensus on defining words such as god and god. Plurality in the concept of divinity and gods causes different thoughts on the application of the word atheism.",

        "paragraph": "In the context that theism is defined as belief in a monotheistic God, people who believe in other gods would be classified as atheists. On the other hand, the ancient Romans also accused Christians of being atheists for not worshiping pagan gods. In the 20th century, this view began to be abandoned as it was considered that theism encompasses the entire belief in gods. Depending on what atheists reject, repudiation of atheism can range from the denial of the existence of gods to the existence of spiritual and paranormal concepts such as those found in Hinduism and Buddhism. Definitions of atheism also vary in the degree to which one must take a position on the idea of \u200b\u200bgod's existence in order to be considered an atheist. Atheism is sometimes broadly defined to include the non-belief in the existence of a god. This broad definition would include people who have no concept of theism as atheists. In 1772, Baron d'Holbach said that \"All children are born atheists, because they do not know God.\" George H. Smith (1979) also suggests that: \"A person who is not familiar with theism is an atheist because he does not believe in God. This category would also include children with the conceptual capacity to understand the issues involved, but who are still unaware of the issues -those issues (as an atheist). The fact that this kid doesn't believe in god makes him deserve to be called an atheist.\" Smith coined the term implicit atheism to refer to \"the absence of a theistic belief without a conscious rejection\" and explicit atheism to refer to a definition of conscious disbelief. In Western culture, the view that children are born atheists is a new idea. Prior to the 18th century, the existence of God was so widely accepted that the very existence of atheism who truly did not believe in God was questioned.",

There is also a position claiming that atheists are quick to believe in God in times of crisis, that atheists make conversions to god upon death or that \"there are no atheists in foxholes.\" Some proponents of this view claim that the anthropological advantages of religion allow humans to cope better with adversity. Some atheists stress the fact that there are many examples that prove the opposite, among them examples of \"true atheists in the foxholes of war.\" Philosophers such as Antony Flew, Michael Martin, and William L. Rowe distinguished between strong (positive) atheism and weak (negative) atheism. Strong atheism is the assertion that there is no god, while weak atheism encompasses all other forms of non-theistic teachings. According to this categorization, anyone who is not a theist can be a weak or strong atheist. The terms weak and strong are new terms, but equivalent terms such as negative and positive atheism have been used in various Catholic philosophical and apologetic literature (in slightly different meanings). Using this limitation of atheism, most agnostics are weak atheists. While Martin emphasized that agnosticism has a weak innate atheism, most agnostics see their views as different from atheism, which they see atheism as untrue as theism. The failure to attain the knowledge necessary to prove or disprove the existence of a god is sometimes seen as an indication that atheism requires a leap of faith. The atheist's response to this argument is that unproven religious propositions should deserve the same amount of disbelief as disbelief in other unproven propositions, and that the unprovability of the existence of a god does not imply that the probability of the existence of a god is the same as the probability of the absence of a god.",

Smart even argued that \"sometimes a truly atheist can call himself an agnostic because of generalized philosophical skepticism which would preclude us from saying we know anything, except perhaps the truths of mathematics and formal logic.\" Because of this, some popular atheist writers such as Richard Dawkins have chosen to distinguish theist, agnostic, and atheist positions as a spectrum of probability to the statement \"God exists\" (theistic probability spectrum). The most widespread basic boundary of atheistic thought is between practical atheism and theoretical atheism. Different forms of theoretical atheism stem from different philosophical arguments and rationales. On the other hand, practical atheism does not require a specific argument and can include disregard for and ignorance of the idea of \u200b\u200ba god. In practical or pragmatic atheism, also known as apatheism, the individual lives without a god and explains natural phenomena without resorting to paranormal reasoning. According to this view, the existence of god is not denied, but can be dismissed as insignificant and useless; God does not give us a purpose in life, nor does he influence our daily life. One form of practical atheism with implications in the scientific community is methodological naturalism, that is the taking of philosophical naturalism's assumptions in the scientific method that are neither articulated with nor without fully accepting or believing in them.\" Practical atheism can be: Theoretical atheism explicitly provides an argument against the existence of a god, and actively responding to theistic arguments for the existence of god, such as the argument from design and Pascal's bet. There are various theoretical reasons for rejecting the existence of god, mainly ontological, gnoseological, and epistemological. In addition there are psychological and sociological reasons.

        "paragraph": "The epistemological basis of atheism is agnosticism. In the philosophy of immanence, divinity cannot be separated from the world itself, including one's mind, and each person's consciousness is locked on the subject. According to this form of agnosticism, limitations on this perspective preclude any objective conclusions about belief in a god and his existence. Kant's rationalistic agnosticism and the Enlightenment accept only knowledge deduced from human rationality. This form of atheism has the position that god cannot be seen as a matter in principle, so it cannot be known whether he exists or not. Skepticism, which is based on Hume's thinking, asserts that the certainty of everything is impossible, so that one can never know the existence of God. The allocation of agnosticism to atheism is contested; it can also be considered as an independent basic worldview. Other arguments in favor of atheism that can be classified as either epistemological or ontological include logical positivism and ignosticism, which assert the meaninglessness or incomprehensibility of basic terms such as \"God\" and statements such as \"God is omnipotent.\" Theological noncognitivism has the position that the statement \"God exists\" is not a proposition, but simply nonsense or cognitively meaningless. Metaphysical atheism is based on metaphysical monism, namely the view that reality is homogeneous and indivisible. Absolute metaphysical atheist belongs to some form of physicalism, thus explicitly rejecting the existence of spirits. Relative metaphysical atheists implicitly reject certain concepts of divinity based on incongruence between their basic philosophy and attributes normally attributed to gods, such as transcendence, personal attributes, and the oneness of god. Examples of relative metaphysical atheism include pantheism, panentheism, and deism. Philosophers such as Ludwig Feuerbach and Sigmund Freud argued that God and other religious beliefs were merely human creations, created to satisfy human psychological and emotional wants and needs.",

Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, influenced by Feuerbach's work, argued that belief in God and religion were social functions, used by the authorities to suppress the working class. According to Mikhail Bakunin, \"the thought of God implies the degradation of human reason and justice; it is the most obvious negation of human freedom, and necessarily ends in the enslavement of mankind, in theory and practice.\" He reversed Voltaire's famous aphorism that if \"God didn't exist, it would have been necessary to create Him\", writing: \"If God really existed, then it would have been necessary to abolish him.\" Logical atheism holds that various concepts of divinity, such as the personal god of Christianity, are considered to be logically inconsistent. These atheists provide deductive arguments against the existence of God, asserting the incompatibility between certain attributes of God, such as God's perfection, creator status, immutability, omnipotence, omniscience, omniscience, transcendence, omni-justice, and all-forgiving. Theodicy atheists believe that this world cannot be reconciled with the attributes of God and the gods as given by theologians. They argue that God's omniscience, omnipotence, and all-merciful are incompatible with a world full of evil and suffering, and that the compassion of gods is invisible to many people. The same argument was also given by Siddhartha Gautama, the founder of Buddhism. Axiological or constructive atheism denies the existence of a god, and instead accepts the existence of \"higher absolutes\" such as humanity. Atheism in this form considers humanity as the absolute source of ethics and values, and allows individuals to solve moral problems independently of God. Marx, Nietzsche, Freud, and Sartre all used this argument to propagate messages of freedom, \u00dcbermensch, and unfettered happiness.",

Blaise Pascal presented this argument in 1669. It is difficult to count the number of atheists in the world. Survey respondents may define \"atheism\" differently or draw different lines between atheism, non-religious beliefs, and non-theistic religious and spiritual beliefs. In addition, people in some parts of the world are reluctant to report themselves as atheists to avoid social stigma, discrimination and persecution. A 2005 survey published in the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica showed that non-religious groups make up about 11.9% of the world's population, and atheists about 2.3%. This number does not include people who follow atheistic religions, such as Buddhism. The November-December 2006 survey conducted in the United States and five European countries, and published in the Financial Times, shows that Americans (73%) tend to believe in more gods/gods or a supreme being of any kind than Europeans.

That same year, Frank Sulloway of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Michael Shermer of California State University conducted a study which found that in their survey sample of \"trusted\" US adults (12% of Ph.Ds and 62% of college graduates) high), 64% believe in God, and there is a correlation indicating a decrease in the level of belief as the level of education increases. An inverse correlation between faith and intelligence has also been found in 39 studies conducted between 1927 and 2002, according to an article in Mensa Magazine. These findings broadly agree with a 1958 statistical meta-analysis carried out by Professor Michael Argyle of the University of Oxford. He analyzed seven research studies that had investigated the correlation between attitudes toward religion and intelligence measures in US school and college students. Although a negative correlation was found clearly, this analysis did not identify causation. However, it is considered that factors such as authoritarian family background and social class may play a partly important role.

Although people who claim to be atheists are usually assumed to be irreligious, certain religious sects also deny the existence of a personal creator god. In recent times, certain religious sects have also attracted many adherents who are openly atheistic, such as atheist Jews or humanist Jews and atheist Christians. Because the strictest definition of positive atheism does not require any specific belief beyond disbelief in gods, atheists can have any spiritual belief. For the same reason, atheists may hold a variety of ethical beliefs, ranging from the moral universalism of humanism, which holds that moral values \u200b\u200bmust be applied consistently to all human beings, to moral nihilism, which argues that morality is meaningless. . Although it is a philosophical truth, succinctly set out in Plato's Euthyphro's dilemma that the role of god in determining right from wrong is neither necessary nor arbitrary, the argument that morality must descend from God and cannot exist without a wise creator has been become an issue that constantly arises in political debate. Moral perceptions such as \"killing is wrong\" are seen as God's law, which requires legislators and judges. However, many atheists argue that treating morality in a legalistic way is a false analogy, and that morality needs not so much a creator of laws as law itself.

Contemporary British political philosopher Martin Cohen offers historical examples of Biblical injunctions advocating torture and slavery as proof that religious injunctions follow social and political norms, rather than social and political norms following religious injunctions. However, he also notes that the same tendency is true for dispassionate and objective philosophers. Cohen expands on this argument in greater detail in Political Philosophy from Plato to Mao in the case of the Koran which he sees as having had a regrettable role in maintaining medieval social codes in the midst of a changing secular society. Nonetheless, atheists such as Sam Harris argue that Western religion's reliance on a Higher authority contributes to authoritarianism and dogmatism. In fact, religious fundamentalism and extrinsic religion (religion is embraced because it is more profitable) are correlated with authoritarianism, dogmatism, and prejudice.

In a society with an advanced civilization, the belief system in God tends to be monotheism. This type of monotheism is divided into practical monotheism, speculative monotheism, theoretical monotheism, and pure monotheism. Monotheism is practically the belief in one worshiped God, but does not deny the existence of other gods. Speculative monotheism is a belief that believes in the existence of one god which originally consisted of other gods which then merged until there was only one left. Theoretical monotheism is an understanding that believes that God is one in theory, but in practice believes in more than one God. Meanwhile, pure monotheism is an understanding which states that God is one in terms of number and nature in theory, practice, thought and appreciation. There are various forms of monotheistic belief, including: For comparison, see Polytheism, which holds that there are many gods. Dualism teaches that there are two independent divine powers or eternal principles, one is Good, and the other is evil, as ancient Zoroastrianism taught (modern Zoroastrianism is completely monotheistic). This view was more fully taught in the later schools of the Gonistic system, such as Manichaeism. Most monotheists would say that by definition monotheism must be the opposite of polytheism. However, devotees within polytheistic traditions often behave like monotheists. This is because a belief in multiple gods does not imply the worship of multiple gods. Historically, many polytheists believed in the existence of many gods, but they worshiped only one, considered by the believer to be the Supreme God. This practice is called henotheism.",

Some people claim that Hinduism never taught polytheism Archived 2009-01-08 on the Wayback Machine.,and such claims could be considered true as one of the views of Hinduism, i.e. the Smarta view which is a monotheistic view which is inclusive of monotheism, as will be discussed later. This Smarta view dominates the view of Hinduism in the West and has confused all Hindus to be seemingly polytheistic. The Smarta division is the only branch of Hinduism that strictly follows this view. Swami Vivekananda, a follower of Ramakrishna, as well as many other figures who introduced Hinduism to the West, were all Smarta followers. Only a Smarta has no problem worshiping Shiva or Vishnu together because he understands them as different aspects of God all leading to the same God. Thus, according to Smarta theology, God can have many aspects and thus, according to this belief, they hold that Vishnu and Shiva are in fact one and the same God. The Smarta theologians, have cited many references to support this view. For example, they interpret verses in Sri Rudram, the most sacred mantra in Shivaism, and Vishnu sahasranama, one of the most sacred prayers in Vaishnavites, to prove this belief. By contrast, a Vaishnavite considers Vishnu as the only one true God, worthy of worship and the worship of other forms as subordinate or simply wrong.",

This belief dominates the view of Hinduism in the west. In contrast, exclusive monotheism claims that all of these gods are false and distinct from a monotheistic God. They are simply the creations of evil forces, or simply a mistake, as Vaishnaism, a school of Hinduism, understands any worship other than Vishnu. Exclusive monotheism is a well-known teaching in the teachings of the Abrahamic religions. Monotheism is thought to have originated from the worship of a single god within a pantheon and the elimination of other gods, as in the case of the worship of Aten during the reign of the Egyptian pharaoh Akhenaten, under the influence of his Eastern wife, Nefertiti. Iconoclasm during the reign of this pharaoh is considered to be the main origin of the destruction of idols in the Abrahamic tradition, which was based on the belief that there is no other God apart from the god they profess. Thus, it really depends here on the dualistic and tacit acknowledgment of the existence of other gods, but only as opponents who must be destroyed because they distract from their main god. Monotheism as inherited by the Israelites in the Exodus experience under Moses is considered, by those who argue that these Israelites were Hyksos, as inheritors of Akhenaten's religious policies, for previously these Jews were polytheists like the -Egyptian. Other issues such as the Divine Right of Kings also arise from the pharaoh's laws regarding rulers as demigods or representatives of the Creator on earth.",

Zoroastrianism is considered by some scholars to be the earliest form of monotheistic belief to evolve in human existence, although some of its derivatives are not entirely so, since the primary God in derivatives such as Zurvanism is not the sole creator. There is a theory that Judaism was influenced by Zoroastrianism, especially during the Babylonian exile, and after that much of the Old Testament was written and edited. It is assumed that earlier Judaism simply recognized that YHVH was a tribal god (possibly related to Yaw) who was the patron god of Abraham's descendants, or that there were many gods but that their god alone was the most powerful. This view is inconsistent with the self-understanding of the Abrahamic religions \u2013 Judaism, Christianity, Islam \u2013 which traditionally assert that exclusive monotheism is the original religion of all mankind, while other gods are seen as idols and beings mistakenly worshiped as gods. . Some professors of archeology make the controversial claim that many stories in the Hebrew Scriptures, including important accounts of Moses, Solomon, and others, were actually developed by scribes originally employed by King Josiah (7th century B.C. ) to rationalize monotheistic belief in YHVH.

Silberman and colleagues, Simon and Schuster, New York (2001). The world classifies Christianity as a monotheistic religion. Christians believe in one God. They acknowledge that this God is one, even though in human understanding God is manifested in three persons: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit (together called the Trinity). In Christian theology, these three persons are not independent but are compatible, meaning that together they have the same character and essence/divine substance and are not in conflict with one another. Nevertheless, there are some minority sects of Christianity, such as the Jehovah's Witnesses, deny the idea of \u200b\u200bTrinity, while others, such as some sects of Mormonism, worship only one god, but are open to the existence of others. Rastafarians, like many other Christians, believe that God is one and also a Trinity, in their case Allah is Haile Selassie. Rastas see themselves, and possibly all individuals, as the Holy Spirit element of the Trinity, with Haile Selassie as an incarnation of both God the Father and God the Son. Haile Selassie is also seen as the head, and the Rastafarians as the body, of God. From the above statements, we can see that like Judaism and Christianity\u2014the Qur'anic interpretation of Allah is a God whose spiritual presence is experienced throughout the entire universe. Islam explains monotheism in a simple way. The Arabic translation of monotheism is (Tawhid). Tauhid means one (derived from the word wahid/ahad). This word implies unification, oneness or keeping something in order to remain one. The truth of a person in Islam is measured by \"submitting himself totally to the teachings of Allah\".",

In addition, just as Judeo-Christian religions believe in angels, Hindus also believe in less powerful existences, such as gods. Contemporary Hinduism is currently divided into four main divisions namely, Vaishnaism, Shivaism, Shaktiism, and Smartaism. Just as Jews, Christians and Muslims believe in one God but differ in their concept of God, all followers of Hinduism believe in one God but differ in their concepts.

According to Greek philosophical tradition, he was the founder of the Elea School and teacher of Parmenides. Apart from being a philosopher, he is also known as a poet. His philosophical thoughts are conveyed through poetry. In addition to philosophical themes, he wrote poetry on traditional themes, such as love, war, games and history. He also dared to criticize Homeros and Hesiodos, the famous Greek poets at that time. His philosophical works in poetic form have been lost. In later times, the work was given the name \"About Nature\" (Concerning Nature). Xenophanes was from Colophon, Ionia, in Asia Minor. It is said in one of the fragments of his own poem that he left his hometown at the age of 25. He left the city after the Persians captured Colophon in 545 BC. Thus he was born around 570 BC. Then he also said that when he wrote the poem, he was 67 years old. Xenophanes is known to be over 100 years old. Therefore, the year of his death is estimated to be around 480 BC. After leaving the city of Colophon, he traveled to many places. There are several ancient sources that say he once settled in the cities of Messina and Katania on the island of Sicily. Apart from that, he has also made stops in Malta, Pharos and Syracuse. Eventually he arrived in Elea, Southern Italy, and settled there. It is known that Xenophanes composed a verse when the city of Elea was founded in 540 BC. Xenophanes stated that humans cannot acquire absolute knowledge. However, at the same time, humans must seek that knowledge even if it is only a possibility. He shows this through the following two fragments: Fragment 18 shows the possibility of seeking knowledge through research.",

According to the two poets, the gods and goddesses commit various shameful acts, such as theft, adultery, and deception of one another. Here, Xenophanes refutes the anthropomorphism of the gods, meaning the depiction of the gods in human form. According to Xenophanes, humans have always assigned human characteristics to gods according to their will. For example, that gods are born because humans are also born, and that gods dress, sound, and look like humans. Xenophanes argued according to the evidence he found: Xenophanes could conclude that anthropomorphism of the gods was inappropriate because he had traveled to various places and seen their various beliefs. Because of this, he became convinced that these were not proper deity concepts. He states that there really is only \"One that encompasses All\". His meaning here is similar to the concept of \"God\" but not the same as monotheism because he also calls it in the plural. According to Xenophanes, this \"One encompasses all\" is unborn and has no end, that is, it is eternal. This is different from the concept of gods who are born and can die. He does not resemble any earthly creature, neither human nor animal. It also does not have organs like humans, but is able to see, think, and hear. He also always stays in the same place but controls everything with his mind alone. Xenophanes thought that the sun goes on in a straight line, and every morning a new sun rises.",

Compound interest in the form of grains, out of the leaf axils. The fruit and young leaves of melinjo can be eaten as vegetables, the seeds are made into chips; and the skin fiber for making nets. Gnetophyta is a division that is considered the most advanced among the four divisions in open seed plants. The anatomical structure that approaches flowering plants is a consideration for this. The similarity lies in the structure of the vessels. Gnetophyta spread from desert areas to areas near tropical rain forests. The genus Welwitschia is a fairly well-known desert shrub in Africa. At first glance, Melinjo is no different from flowering plants. Unlike most biological groupings, it is difficult to find many common characteristics among all members of the gnetophyte. The two most commonly used general characteristics are the presence of specialized leaf envelopes around both ovules and microsporangia and micropyle projections from the outer membrane of the ovules that produce pollinating droplets, although these are highly specific compared to similarities between most of the other plant divisions.

Knowledge of the history of gnetophytes with fossil discoveries has increased tremendously since the 1980s. Gnetophyta fossils have been found to date from Perem and the Triassic. Fossils dating from the Jurassic period have been found, although whether or not they belong to the division gnetophyta is uncertain. Overall, the fossil record is most abundant in the Early Cretaceous, with fossils of plants, seeds, and pollen grains having been found that can be clearly assigned to gnetophyta. With only three well-defined genera within the entire division, there remains an understandable difficulty in establishing unambiguous interrelationships between them; in the early days the problem is even more difficult and we find for example Pearson in the early 20th century talking about the class of Gnetales, rather than the order. G. H. M. Lawrence referred to them as an order, but remarked that the three families were distinct enough to deserve recognition as separate orders. GHM Lawrence referred to them as an order, but said the three families were sufficiently different to deserve recognition as separate orders. Foster & Gifford accepted this principle, and placed all three orders together in a general class for convenience, which they called Gnetopsida. In general the evolutionary relationships among seed plants are still unresolved, and the Gnetophyta have played an important role in the formation of phylogenetic hypotheses.

In this hypothesis, the gnetophytes, along with the extinct order Bennettitales, are the sisters of the angiosperms, which form the \"anthophytes\". Some of the morphological characters suggested for assembling anthophytes include woody vessels, veined leaves (in Gnetum only), lignin chemistry, inner cell layers of apical meristems, pollen and megaspores (including thin megaspore walls), short cambial initials, and lignin syringe clusters .

However, it did not gain strong support, until the emergence of molecular data in the late 1990s. Although the most salient morphological evidence still largely supports the anthophytic hypothesis, there are some more obscure morphological similarities between gnetophytes and conifers that support the gnetifer hypothesis. These shared features include: tracheids with scalariform pits with tori interspersed with annular thickenings, absence of scalariform pits in the primary xylem, leaves such as Ephedra and Welwitschia cord-like and cord-shaped; and reduced sporophyll. angiosperms (flowering plants) cycads Ginkgo conifers gnetophytes The gnepine hypothesis is a modification of the gnetifer hypothesis, and suggests that gnetophytes belong to conifers as a sister group to Pinaceae. According to this hypothesis, conifers as they are currently defined are not a monophyletic group, in contrast to the molecular findings that support their monophylaxis. All existing evidence for this hypothesis comes from molecular studies since 1999. However, the morphological evidence remains difficult to reconcile with the gnepine hypothesis. If gnetophytes nest within a conifer, they must lose several characters co-derived from the conifer (or these characteristics must have evolved in parallel in the other two conifer lineages): narrow triangular leaves (gnetophytes vary in leaf shapes), resin canals, tiered proembryos, and flattened scales of the ovuliferous cones.

This hypothesis does not explain the height of the angular momentum of the Earth-Moon system. The current hypothesis is that the Earth-Moon system formed as a result of a large impact, when a Mars-sized celestial body (named Theia) collided with a newly formed proto-Earth, spewing material into orbit around it which then amassed to form the Moon. This hypothesis is probably the most explanatory hypothesis regarding the origin of the Moon, although its explanation is not perfect. Large collisions are thought to have been common in the early formation of the Solar System. Computer simulation modeling of large impacts corresponds to the size of the angular momentum of the Earth-Moon system and the small size of the Moon's core. These simulations also show that most of the material on the Moon came from the impacting planets, not from the proto-Earths. However, recent tests have shown that most of the Moon's material comes from Earth, not from impactors.

The team found that Moon rocks brought to Earth through the Apollo Program have isotopes identical to Earth rocks, and different from rocks on most other celestial bodies in the Solar System.

This structure is thought to have formed as a result of fractional crystallization in a sea of \u200b\u200bmagma shortly after the formation of the Moon 4.5 billion years ago. The crystallization of this magma ocean will form a mafic mantle, which is also caused by the precipitation and decay of the minerals olivine, clinopyroxene, and orthopyroxene; after three-quarters of the magma ocean has crystallized, low-density plagioclase minerals will form and float to the top of the crust. The last liquid to undergo the crystallization process would be trapped between the crust and mantle, with incompatibilities and abundant heat-producing elements. In accordance with this process, geochemical mapping of the orbit shows that a large part of the Moon's crust is anorthosite, and tests conducted on samples of Moon rock originating from surface lava floods also reveal that the Moon's mafic mantle is richer in iron compared to Earth's. Geophysical techniques explain that the average thickness of the Moon's crust is ~50 km. The Moon is the second densest satellite in the Solar System after Io. However, the Moon's inner core is small, with a radius of about 350 km or less; this size is only ~20% of the overall size of the Moon, in contrast to other terrestrial celestial bodies, whose inner core is almost 50% of the overall size. The composition of the Moon is not known with certainty, but is thought to be a combination of metallic iron with small amounts of sulfur and nickel; analysis of the variable rotation time of the Moon indicates that some of the Moon's core is liquid. The topography of the Moon has been measured using laser altimetry and stereo image analysis. The most obvious topographical feature is the South Pole Aitken basin on the far side, about 2,240 km in diameter, which is the largest crater on the Moon and the largest crater ever discovered in the Solar System.",

While the highest point is in the northeastern part, which is thought to have thickened due to the formation of the Aitken South Pole basin. Other giant basins, such as Imbrium, Serenitatis, Crisium, Smythii, and Orientale, are much lower in width and elevation. The average altitude of the far side of the Moon is approximately 1.9 km higher than the near side. The dark colored plains of the Moon that can be observed with the unaided eye are called maria (Latin for \"sea\"; or mare in the singular), because astronomers long ago thought these plains were filled with water. This plain is a large pool formed from basalt lava. Although similar to terrestrial basalt, mare basalt has a higher iron content and less mineral content. Most of this lava erupted or flowed through processes concurrent with the formation of the impact craters. Several geological features of the Moon's surface such as shield volcanoes and volcanic domes can be found in the maria on the near side of the Moon. Maria can be found almost all over the near side of the Moon, covering 31% of the total surface on the near side, much higher than the maria on the far side, which percentage is only 2%. This is thought to be due to the high concentration of heat-producing elements beneath the crust on the near side, as seen on the geochemical map obtained by the Lunar Prospector's gamma-ray spectrometer, which causes the mantle to warm, melt, then rise to the surface and erupt. Most of the Moon's mare basalts erupted in the Imbrian period, around 3.0\u20133.5 billion years ago, although radiometric dating suggests an older date of 4.2 billion years ago, and the last eruption, dated crater counts, occurred around 1.2 billion years ago.",

Based on radiometric dating, the lunar highlands formed around 4.4 billion years ago, and are thought to be accumulations of plagioclase from the Moon's magma oceans. Unlike Earth, there are no mountains on the Moon that are believed to have formed as a result of tectonic events. Another geological process that influences the shape of the Moon's surface is impact cratering, which is when craters are formed as a result of the collision of asteroids and comets with the Moon's surface. It is estimated that there are about 300,000 craters with an area of \u200b\u200bmore than 1 km on the near side of the Moon. Some of these craters are named after experts, scientists, artists, and explorers. The Moon's geological time scale is based on the most violent impact events, including Nectaris, Imbrium, and Orientale, with structures characterized by rings of vaporized matter, typically hundreds to thousands of kilometers in diameter. The lack of recent atmospheric activity, weather, and geological processes proves that these craters are still in good condition. Although only a few craters are known about the origin of their formation, they are still useful in determining the relative age of the Moon. Because impact craters accumulate at a nearly constant rate, calculating the number of craters per unit area can be used to estimate the age of the Moon's surface. The radiometric age of crater rocks brought back by the Apollo missions ranges from 3.8 to 4.1 billion years; it is used to describe the time of the Late Heavy Bombardment impact. The plains covering the upper part of the Moon's crust are a highly comminuted surface (broken into smaller particles) and a surface layer of crater gardens called regolith, which was formed by impact processes.",

Regolith on older surfaces is generally thicker than on younger surfaces; it varies in thickness, from 10\u201320 m on the plateau and 3\u20135 m on the maria. Beneath the regolith layer is megaregolith, a layer of fractured rock many kilometers thick. Liquid water cannot survive on the surface of the Moon. When exposed to solar radiation, water quickly decomposes through a process known as photodissociation and vanishes into space. However, since the 1960s, scientists have suggested that water ice transported by comets during impacts or produced by the reaction of oxygen-rich lunar rock, and hydrogen from the solar wind, left trails of water that might persist in craters at the Moon's south pole. permanently cold and dark. Computer simulations show that nearly 14,000 km2 of the Moon's surface is in the permanently dark polar region. Availability of water on the Moon in sufficient quantities is an important factor in planning the Moon colonization process because it will save costs; alternative plans to transport water from Earth would be prohibitively expensive. Years ago, traces of water were found on the surface of the Moon. In 1994, bistatic radar experiments on the Clementine spacecraft showed pockets of frozen water around the Moon's surface. However, later radar observations by Arecibo suggested the find may be rock ejected from a young impact crater. In 1998, the neutron spectrometer on board the Lunar Prospector spacecraft discovered a high concentration of hydrogen in a layer of regolith one meter deep in the polar regions.",

In 2008, the Chandrayaan-1 probe confirmed the presence of water ice on the Moon's surface using the Moon Mineralogy Mapper. The spectrometer observed hydroxyl absorption lines in sunlight, which proved that the Moon's surface contains large amounts of water ice. The probe indicated that the concentration of water ice might be as high as 1,000 ppm. In 2009, LCROSS sent a 2,300\u00a0kg impactor to a permanently dark polar crater, and detected at least 100\u00a0kg of water in the ejector material. Analysis of other LCROSS data shows that the amount of water detected reaches 155 kg. In May 2011, Erik Hauri reported the presence of 615\u20131410 ppm of molten-water inclusions in lunar sample 74220, a \"orange glass soil\" with a high titanium content of volcanic origin collected on the Apollo 17 mission in 1972. These inclusions formed during the a major eruption on the Moon about 3.7 billion years ago. This concentration is equivalent to magma in Earth's upper mantle. The Moon's gravitational field has been measured using Doppler shift tracking in radio signals emitted by spacecraft orbiting the Moon. The main gravitational feature of the Moon is conmas, a positive gravity anomaly associated with several large impact basins, caused in part by the dense mare basaltic lava flows that filled these basins. This anomaly greatly affected the spacecraft's orbit around the Moon. There is some debate about the gravity of the Moon: flowing lava by itself cannot explain the gravitational shape of the Moon, and some of the existing konmas is completely unrelated to mare volcanism.",

The Moon does not have a global dipolar magnetic field, instead generated by a liquid metal core geodynamo, and only has crustal magnetization, which may have existed early in the Moon's history when the geodynamo was still operational. In addition, some of the residual magnetization comes from the temporary magnetic field generated during the big impact event, by expanding the plasma generated by the impact. This hypothesis is supported by the magnetization of the crust located near the large impact basin antipode. The Moon has an extremely tenuous, in fact nearly void, atmosphere with a total mass of less than 10 metric tons. The surface pressure is about 3 \u00d7 10\u221215 atm (0.3 nPa); the size varies according to the day of the Moon. Sources of the Moon's atmosphere include gas release and atomic release due to the bombardment of the Moon's soil by solar wind ions. The elements contained in the Moon's atmosphere are sodium and potassium, which are produced by the loss of atoms; the element is also found in the atmospheres of Mercury and Io. Other elements include helium-4 which is produced from the solar wind; and argon-40, radon-222, and polonium-210, which are released into space after being generated through radioactive decay processes in the crust and mantle. The absence of neutral species (atoms or molecules) in the atmosphere such as oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, hydrogen and magnesium, which are present in regolith, remains unexplained.

Because of this, variations in solar illumination on the Moon have much less seasonality, and topographical detail plays an important role in the effects of changing seasons. Based on photographs taken by the Clementine probe in 1994, there are four mountainous regions on the outskirts of the Peary crater at the Moon's north pole, which are thought to remain illuminated by the Sun throughout the Moon's day, creating peaks of perpetual light. No such region exists at the Moon's south pole. In addition, there are areas that receive no permanent light at the bottom of polar craters, and these dark craters are very cold; The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter recorded the lowest summer temperatures at the south polar crater of 35 K (\u2212238 \u00b0C) and nearly 26 K at the winter solstice at the Hermite crater at the north pole. This is the coldest temperature in the Solar System ever measured by a space probe, even colder than the surface temperature of Pluto. The Moon completes a complete orbit around the Earth every 27.3 days] (sidereal period). However, because the Earth moves in its orbit around the Sun at the same time, it takes slightly longer for the Moon to show the same phase to Earth, which is about 29.5 days (synodic period). Unlike most other planetary satellites, the Moon's orbit is closer to the ecliptic plane than to the planet's equatorial plane. The Moon's orbit is perturbed by the Sun and Earth in subtle and complex ways.

The Moon is the largest natural satellite in the Solar System by the relative sizes of the planets it orbits, although Charon is larger for the dwarf planet Pluto, at about 1/9th the mass of Pluto. Despite this, the Earth and Moon are still considered a planet-satellite system, not a multiple planetary system, because the barricenters of these two celestial bodies are located 1,700 km (about a quarter of Earth's radius) below Earth's surface. The moon is in synchronous rotation; the time it takes for the Moon to rotate on its axis is roughly the same as the time it takes to orbit the Earth. Therefore, the Moon always shows the same side to the Earth. Early in its history, the Moon's rotation was slower and tidal locking occurred in this orientation, mainly due to the frictional effects of Earth-induced tidal deformation. The side of the Moon facing Earth is called the near side, while the side facing away from Earth is called the far side. The far side is often mistaken for the \"dark side\", despite the fact that it is as illuminated by light as the near side. Once a month, the near dark side can be seen from Earth during the new moon phase. The moon has a very low albedo, being slightly brighter than the black asphalt. Nonetheless, the Moon is the brightest celestial body in the sky after the Sun. i] This is partly due to an increase in brightness due to opposition effects; in the quarter moon phase, only a tenth of the Moon is bright, not a quarter. Additionally, color constancy in the Moon's visual system calibrates the relationship between the color of objects and their surroundings; because the sky around the Moon is relatively dark, the Sunlit Moon appears as a bright celestial body.",

The Moon appears larger the closer it is to the horizon, but this is simply a psychological effect, known as the Moon illusion (first described in the 7th century BC). The average arc magnitude of a full moon is about 0.52\u00b0 in the sky, about the size of the Sun as seen from Earth (see eclipse). The Moon's height in the sky varies; although it has nearly the same boundary as the Sun, its altitude changes with the phases of the Moon and the seasons of the year, with the highest altitude occurring during the full moon in winter. The Moon's 18.6-year nod cycle also has an influence; when the ascending node of the Moon's orbit is at the vernal equinox, the Moon's declination can move as far as 28\u00b0 each month. This means the Moon can move across latitudes up to 28\u00b0 from the equator instead of 18\u00b0. The orientation of the crescent also depends on latitude; near the equator, the crescent moon can be observed with binoculars. The distance between the Moon and Earth varies, ranging from 356,400 km to 406,700 km at perige (closest point) and apoge (farthest point). On March 19, 2011, the Moon at full phase was at its closest approach to Earth, its closest since 1993, which is 14% closer than its farthest position at apogee.

This results in a pronounced reduction increase of up to 14% between the apogee and perige of the Moon at the same phase. There is debate about whether the surface of the Moon changes over time. Currently, the phenomenon is considered to be a mere illusion, resulting from observing the Moon in different lighting conditions, poor astronomical vision, or inadequate images. However, gas discharges do occur occasionally, and are thought to be events that cause transient lunar phenomena. Recently, it has been suggested that the approximately 3\u00a0km diameter of the Moon's surface was modified by a gas-releasing event, which occurred about one million years ago. The appearance of the Moon, like that of the Sun, is affected by the Earth's atmosphere; common effects are the 22\u00b0 halo rings that form when moonlight is refracted by ice crystals in cirrostratus clouds, and the formation of smaller corona rings when the moon is covered by wispy clouds. Tides on the Moon are generally caused by a change in the intensity of the gravitational pull of the Moon on one side of the Earth on the other side, or what is known as tidal force. This phenomenon forms two tidal bulges on Earth, which will be clearly visible on the surface of the sea after the tide recedes. Because the Earth rotates 27 times faster than the Moon, these bulges move with the Earth's surface faster than the Moon, which rotates around Earth once a day as the Moon rotates on its axis. Tides are also affected by other effects, including the frictional force of water on the Earth's axis of rotation through the ocean floor, the inertia of water movement, the shallowing of ocean basins, and the oscillations between different ocean basins.",

        "paragraph": "The gravitational pull of the Sun on Earth's oceans is almost half that of the Moon, and the gravity of these two celestial bodies plays an important role in causing nepal tides and spring tides. The gravitational interaction between the Moon and the bulge around the Moon acts as a torque on Earth's rotation, which drains angular momentum and rotational kinetic energy from Earth's spin. As a result, angular momentum is imparted to the Moon's orbit, which speeds up its rotation and causes the Moon to ascend to a higher orbit with a longer period. Therefore, the distance between the Earth and the Moon will also increase, and the Earth's rotation will slow down. Measurements using the lunar range experiment using laser reflectors carried out during the Apollo missions found that the distance from the Moon to Earth increases by about 38 mm per year (although this figure is only 0.10 ppb/year of the Moon's orbital radius). Atomic clocks also show that the length of the Earth's day increases by about 15 microseconds per year, gradually extending the UTC time adjusted by leap seconds. The Moon's tidal pull will continue until the Earth's rotation and the Moon's orbital period match. However, the Sun will turn into a red giant and annihilate the Earth long before that happens. The surface of the Moon also experiences tides with an amplitude of ~10 cm, which last for more than 27 days. This phenomenon is caused by two things, namely because the Moon and Earth are in synchronous rotation, and various things caused by the Sun. The induced Earth component forms due to libration, which results from the eccentricity of the Moon's orbit; if the Moon's orbit were perfectly circular, then all that would appear would be the solar tides. The libration also changes the viewing angle of the Moon, causing about 59% of the Moon's surface to be visible from Earth.",

These moonquakes are rarer and weaker in strength than earthquakes, although they can last up to an hour due to the absence of water to act as a seismic damper. This phenomenon of moonquakes is the unexpected discovery of seismometers placed on the Moon by Apollo astronauts from 1969 to 1972. Eclipses can occur when the Sun, Earth and Moon are in a straight line (called \"syzygy\"). A solar eclipse occurs during a new moon, when the Moon is between the Sun and the Moon. In contrast, a lunar eclipse occurs during a full moon, when the Earth is between the Sun and Moon. The size of the Moon as seen from Earth is roughly the same size as the Sun. However, the size of the Sun is much larger than the size of the Moon; the distance between the Sun and the Moon is very far, causing the sizes of these two celestial bodies to appear the same from Earth. This variation in size, caused by non-circular orbits, is also nearly the same, even though they occur in different cycles. This results in total solar eclipses (when the Moon appears larger than the Sun) and annular (when the Moon appears smaller than the Sun). During a total eclipse, the Moon completely covers the Sun's disk and solar corona, which can be observed with the naked eye from Earth. As the distance between the Sun and the Moon increases slowly over time, the Moon's angular diameter decreases. In addition, as the Sun evolves into a red giant, the Sun's size and apparent diameter in the sky also increase slowly. j] The combination of these two phenomena proves that hundreds of millions of years ago, the Moon would always cover the Sun during solar eclipses, and there may not have been any an annular eclipse that occurred at that time.",

The Moon's orbit around the Earth experiences an inclination of about 5\u00b0 from the Earth's orbit around the Sun, so eclipses do not occur every new moon and full moon. An eclipse will occur if the Moon is near the intersection of the two orbital planes. The periodization and recurrence of solar eclipses by the Moon, as well as lunar eclipses by the Earth, can be explained by the theory of saros, which has a period of about 18 years. Because the Moon blocks human view by about a half-degree circle in an area of \u200b\u200bthe sky,k]related phenomena such as occultations occur when a bright star or planet passes behind the Moon and becomes occulted, or hidden from view. Similar to this phenomenon, a solar eclipse occurs when the Sun is hidden from view because it is covered by the Moon. Because the Moon is much closer to Earth, occultations of single stars cannot be seen from anywhere on the Earth's surface at the same time. The precession in the Moon's orbit also causes different occultations to occur each year. The understanding of the cycles of the Moon marked the beginning of the development of astronomy; by the 5th century BC, Babylonian astronomers had recorded the 18-year Saros cycle of lunar eclipses, and Indian astronomers had explained the phenomenon of the Moon's elongation. The Chinese astronomer Shi Shen (4th century BC) gave instructions related to how to predict solar and lunar eclipses. Later, the physical form of the Moon and the source of the moon's light became known. The ancient Greek philosopher Anaxagoras (d. 428 BC) suggested that the Sun and Moon are two giant round stones that produce light.

Shen Kuo (1031\u20131095) of the Song dynasty devised an allegory that likened the phenomenon of the shining and fading of the moon's light to a rotating ball; when spiked with white powder and viewed from the side, it looks like a crescent shape. In Aristotle's (384-322 BCE) description of the universe, the Moon marks the boundary between the mutable elements (earth, water, air, and fire) and the eternal stars of aether, an influential philosophical thought that dominated science for centuries to come. In the 2nd century BC, Seleucus of Seleucia theorized that the tides are due to the attraction of the Moon, and that the height of the tides is determined by the position of the Moon relative to the Sun. In the same century, Aristarchus calculated the size and distance of the Moon from the Earth, with it being about twenty times the radius of the Earth.

Moon craters were first noted by Galileo, and were initially thought to be volcanic until the 1870s, when Richard Proctor explained that the craters were formed by impacts.

An alkaline earth metal, strontium is a silver-white or yellowish soft metallic element that is highly reactive chemically. the metal forms a dark oxide layer when exposed to air. Strontium has similar physical and chemical properties to its two vertical neighbors in the periodic table, calcium and barium. It occurs naturally in the minerals Celestine, strontianite, and putnisite, and is mined in most of the first two of these. While natural strontium is stable, the synthetic isotope 90Sr is radioactive and is one of the most dangerous components of nuclear fallout, as strontium is absorbed by the body in a similar way to calcium. Stable natural strontium, on the other hand, is not harmful to health. Both strontium and strontianite are named after Strontian, a village in Scotland near which the mineral was discovered in 1790 by Adair Crawford and William Cruickshank; it was identified as a new element in the next year's red-red flame test color. Strontium was first isolated as a metal in 1808 by Humphry Davy using the then newly discovered process of electrolysis. The production of sugar from beet sugar in the 19th century was the largest application of strontium (see Strontian process). At the peak of television cathode-ray tube production, as much as 75 percent of the strontium consumption in the United States went into faceplate glass. With the move away from the cathode ray tube to other display methods, strontium consumption has dropped dramatically. CHARACTERISTICS Strontium is a divalent silvery metal with a pale yellow color whose properties are largely intermediate between and similar to those of its calcium group neighbors and barium. It is softer than calcium and harder than barium. Its melting (777\u00b0C) and boiling points (1655\u00b0C) points are lower than that of calcium (842\u00b0C and 1757\u00b0C respectively); barium continues this trend decreasing in its melting point (727\u00b0C), but not in its boiling point (2170\u00b0C).",

Three allotropes of metallic strontium exist, with transition points at 235 and 540 \u00b0C. The standard electrode potential for the Sr2+/Sr pair is -2.89 V, about the middle between those of the Ca2+/Ca (-2.84 V) and Ba2+/Ba (-2.92 V) pairs, and close to those of the neighboring alkali metals. Strontium is intermediate between calcium and barium reactivity towards water, with which it reacts on contact to produce strontium hydroxide and hydrogen gas. Metal strontium burns in air to produce both strontium oxide and strontium nitride, but because it does not react with nitrogen below 380 \u00b0C, at room temperature, it forms only the oxide spontaneously. In addition to the simple oxide SrO, peroxide SrO2 can be prepared by the direct oxidation of strontium metal under high oxygen pressure, and there is some evidence for the yellow superoxide Sr(O2)2. Strontium hydroxide, Sr(OH)2, is a strong base, although it is not as strong as hydroxide of barium or alkali metals. Because of the large size of the heavy block elements, including strontium, a wide variety of coordination numbers are known, from 2, 3, or 4 to 22 or 24 in SrCd11 and SrZn13. The large sizes of strontium and barium play an important role in stabilizing strontium complexes with polydentate macrocyclic ligands such as crown ethers: for example, while 18-crown-6 forms relatively weak complexes with calcium and alkali metals, strontium and barium complexes are much stronger. Organostrontium compounds contain one or more strontium-carbon bonds. They have been reported as intermediates in Barbier-type reactions.",

Organostrontium compounds tend to be more similar to organoeuropium or organosamarium compounds because of the similar ionic radii of the elements (Sr2 + 118 pm; EU2 + 117 pm; SM2 + 122 pm). Most of these compounds can only be prepared at low temperatures; large ligands tend to favor stability. For example, strontium dicyclopentadienyl, Sr(C5H5) 2, must be made by directly reacting strontium metal with mercurocene or cyclopentadiene alone; replacing the C5H5 ligand with the bulkier C5(CH3) 5 ligand on the other hand improves the solubility, volatility of these compounds, and kinetic stability. Due to its extreme reactivity with oxygen and water, this element occurs naturally only in compounds with other elements, such as in the minerals strontianite and celestine. It is stored under liquid hydrocarbons such as mineral oil or kerosene to prevent oxidation; Freshly exposed strontium metal quickly turns a yellowish color with formation of the oxide. Finely powdered strontium metal is pyrophoric, meaning that it will ignite spontaneously in air at room temperature. Volatile strontium salts give a bright red color to fire, and these salts are used in fireworks and in the production of flares. Like calcium and barium, the metal strontium dissolves directly in liquid ammonia to give a dark blue solution. Natural strontium isotopes are mixtures of four stable isotopes. 84Sr, 86Sr, 87Sr, and 88Sr They increase in abundance with increasing total mass and weight, 88Sr, making up about 82.6% of all natural strontium, although abundance varies due to radiogenic production of 87Sr as the beta-active daughter of 87Rb.",

While 90Sr (half-life 28.90 years) has been used similarly, it is also an isotope of concern in fallout from nuclear weapons and in nuclear accidents because of its production as a fission product. Its presence in the bones can cause bone cancer, cancer of the surrounding tissue, and leukemia. The 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident contaminated approximately 30,000 km2 by more than 10 kBq/m2 with 90Sr, which accounted for 5% of the 90Sr core stock. HISTORY Strontium is named after the Scottish village of Strontian (Gaelic SRON a t-Sithein), where it was found in the ore of tin mines. In 1790, Adair Crawford, a physician involved in the preparation of barium, and his colleague William Cruickshank, recognized that Strontian ores exhibited different properties from those in other \"heavy spar\" sources. This allowed Adair to conclude on page 355 \"...it is highly probable indeed, that the mineral scotch is a new species of earth which has not hitherto been sufficiently investigated.\" Physician and mineral collector Friedrich Gabriel Sulzer jointly analyzed the mineral from Strontian with Johann Friedrich Blumenbach and named it strontianite. He also came to the conclusion that it was different from witherite and contained a new earth (neue grunderde). In 1793 Thomas Charles Hope, a professor of chemistry at the University of Glasgow proposed the name strontites. He confirms Crawford's earlier work and narrates: \"...In view of the strange earth I thought it necessary to give it a name.

In keeping with the other alkaline earth names, he changed the name to strontium The first large-scale application of strontium was in the production of sugar from beet sugar.Although a crystallization process using strontium hydroxide was patented by Augustin-Pierre Dubrunfaut in 1849, its large-scale introduction came with process improvements in the early 1870s.The German sugar industry used both processes into the 20th century.Before World War I the beet sugar industry used 100,000 to 150,000 tonnes of strontium hydroxide for this process per year.The strontium hydroxide was recycled in the process, but the demand for replacement losses during production was high enough to create a significant demand starting mining strontianite in M\u00fcnsterland.Pe The mining of strontianite in Germany ended when mining of the Celestine deposit in Gloucestershire began. These mines provided most of the world's strontium supply from 1884 to 1941. Although the Celestine deposits in the Granada basin were known for some time large-scale mining did not begin before the 1950's. During testing of atmospheric nuclear weapons, he observed that strontium-90 was one of the relatively high-yield products of nuclear fission.

In soil strontium behaves chemically like calcium. At medium to acidic pH Sr2+ is the predominant strontium species. In the presence of calcium ions, strontium generally forms coprecipitates with calcium minerals such as calcite and anhydrite at increased pH. At medium to acidic pH, dissolved strontium is bound to soil particles by cation exchange. The average strontium content of seawater is 8 mg/l. At concentrations between 82 and 90 \u00b5mol/l of strontium, the concentration is much lower than that of calcium, which is usually between 9.6 and 11.6 mmol/l. It remains much higher than barium, 13 ug/l. MINES OF THE WORLD The three main producers of strontium as Celestine in 2015 were China (150,000 t), Spain (90,000 t), and Mexico (70,000 t); Argentina (10,000 t) and Morocco (2,500 t) are small producers. Although strontium deposits occur widely in the United States, they have not been mined since 1959. Most of the mined celestine (SrSO4) is converted to carbonate by two processes. Either Celestine is directly leached with sodium carbonate solution or Celestine is roasted with coal to form sulfides. The second stage produces a dark colored material containing mostly strontium sulfides. This is called \"black ash\" dissolved in water and filtered. Strontium carbonate is precipitated from strontium sulfide solutions by the introduction of carbon dioxide. sulfates reduced to sulfides by carbothermic reduction: Approximately 300,000 tons are processed in this way annually.",

Thus, business and communication go hand in hand. In business communication there are six main elements, namely the activity of exchanging messages is carried out between elements of the company, including: Unlike the first, this communication is related to conveying messages to people outside the company circle, including: Nonverbal communication is a communication process in which messages are conveyed without using words. Examples of nonverbal communication are using gestures, body language, facial expressions and eye contact, the use of objects such as clothing, haircuts, and so on, symbols, and ways of speaking such as intonation, emphasis, voice quality, emotional style, and speaking style. Experts in the field of nonverbal communication usually use a strict definition of \"no words,\" and do not equate non-verbal communication with non-verbal communication. For example, sign language and writing are not considered nonverbal communication because they use words, while intonation and speech style are classified as nonverbal communication. Nonverbal communication is also different from subconscious communication, which can be either verbal or nonverbal communication. A policeman wearing a uniform is a form of object communication. The most common object communication is the use of clothing. People are often judged by the type of clothes they wear, although this is considered a form of stereotype. For example, people often prefer other people who dress attractively. In addition, in a job interview someone who is well dressed tends to get a job more easily than one who is not. Another example of using object communication is uniform. Haptics is the field that studies touch as a nonverbal communication.",

Touch can also cause a feeling in the recipient of the touch, either positive or negative. Chronemics is a field that studies the use of time in nonverbal communication. The use of time in nonverbal communication includes the duration that is considered suitable for an activity, the number of activities that are considered appropriate to be carried out within a certain period of time, and punctuality. In nonverbal communication, kinesics or gestures are body movements including eye contact, facial expressions, gestures, and body postures. Gestures are usually used to replace a word or phrase, for example nodding to say yes; to illustrate or explain something; showing feelings, for example hitting the table to show anger; to arrange or control the course of conversation; or to release tension. Proxemics or spatial language, namely the distance you use when communicating with other people, including the place or location where you are. Setting the distance determines how far or how close your intimacy level is with other people, shows how much you appreciate, like or dislike and care for other people, besides that it also shows social symbols. In the personal space, it can be divided into 4 interpersonal spaces: Vocals are nonverbal elements in an utterance, namely the way of speaking. The science that studies this is called paralinguistics. Examples are tone of voice, tone of voice, loudness or weakness of voice, speed of speech, voice quality, intonation, and so on. In addition, the use of filler sounds such as \"mm\", \"e\", \"o\", \"um\", when speaking is also classified as a vocal element, and in good communication things like this should be avoided.",

Nonverbal behavior can repeat verbal behavior. For example, you nod your head when you say \"Yes,\" or shake your head when you say \"No,\" or indicate the direction (with your forefinger) where someone should go to find a restroom. Nonverbal behavior can replace verbal behavior, so without speaking you can interact with other people. For example, a busker comes to your car and then without saying a word you shake your hand with your palm facing forward (as a substitute for \"No\"). These nonverbal cues that replace words or phrases are called emblems. Nonverbal behavior can contradict or contradict verbal behavior and can give another meaning to verbal messages. For example, you praise a friend's achievements with a pout. Reinforces, emphasizes or complements verbal behavior. For example, using hand movements, a slow tone of voice when making a speech. These nonverbal cues are called affect displays. Nonverbal behavior can regulate verbal behavior. For example, when a lecture is about to end, you check your watch two or three times so that the lecturer immediately closes the lecture. A person's culture of origin greatly determines how that person communicates nonverbally. These differences can include East-West cultural differences, high-context and low-context cultures, language, etc. For example, people from Oriental cultures tend to avoid direct eye contact, whereas people in the Middle East, India and the United States generally consider eye contact important to convey trustworthiness, and people who avoid eye contact are seen as not being trustworthy. Verbal communication is communication using verbal symbols. The verbal symbols of language are the most impressive human achievements.

Problems in cross-cultural communication usually come from problems in the transmission of messages. In communication between people of the same culture, the person receiving the message interprets it based on values, beliefs, and expectations for behavior similar to those of the people sending the message. When this occurs, the way the message is interpreted by the receiver is quite similar to what the speaker intended. However, when the recipient of the message is a person from a different culture, the recipient uses information from the speaker's culture to interpret the message. The interpreted message may be very different from what the speaker intended. Attribution is a process by which people seek explanations about the behavior of others. When a person does not understand another person, he or she usually blames the confusion on the other \"stupidity, lies, or madness\". Effective communication depends on informal understanding between the parties involved which is based on the trust that develops between them. When trust exists, implicit understanding in communication and cultural differences can be ignored, and problems can be handled more easily. The meaning of belief and how it is developed and communicated varies across societies. Likewise, some cultures tend to be more trusted than others. Nonverbal communication is a behavior that communicates without words\u2014although they can often be accompanied by words. Minor variations in body language, speech, rhythm, and timing often lead to mistrust and misperceptions of the situation between intercultural parties.

Proxemics concerns the proximity and location of the communication process (eg: personal space or office layout). Paralanguage refers to how something is said, not the content of what is said, for example, speed of speech, changes in voice, other sounds, laughter, yawns, and silence. Objects of language or material culture refer to the ways in which we communicate through material artifacts\u2014for example, architecture, office and furniture designs, clothing, cars, cosmetics, and time. In monochronic culture, time is experienced linearly and as something to be spent, saved, created, or wasted. People tend to concentrate on only one thing at a time. In polychronic cultures, people tolerate many things going on simultaneously and emphasize involvement with other people. In this culture, people are highly distracted, focus on several things at once, and change plans frequently. Key points to consider: There is a relationship between a person's personality and the ability to adapt to the environment in a particular country\u2014including the ability to communicate in that environment. The two keys to personality are openness and resilience. Openness includes traits such as tolerance for ambiguity, extroversion, and open-mindedness. Resilience includes having good self-control abilities, persistence, tolerance for ambiguity, and resourcefulness.

Kinesic behavior is communication through body movement\u2014for example, postures, gestures, facial expressions and eye contact. The meaning of these behaviors varies between countries and influences cross-cultural communication. Forms of kinesic nonverbal communication are eye contact and using the eyes to convey messages. Overall, nonverbal communication provides clues for what is said verbally with physical representations. Nonverbal communication techniques are used around the world and in some cultures. Nonverbal and kinesic communication are not the only ways to communicate without words. Proxemics, a form of nonverbal communication, is concerned with the influence of proximity and communication space. Another form of nonverbal behavior and communication related to cross-cultural communication is paralanguage. Paralanguage refers to how something is said, not the content of what is said\u2014for example, speech rate, pitch and inflection of voice, other noises, laughing, yawning, and silence. Paralanguage will then touch on the verbal part of cross-cultural communication. Nonverbal communication has been shown to account for between 65% and 93% of the interpretability of the communication process.

Impressions are formed in the minds of those who are involved in communication. Everyone engages in communication because they have information, ideas, and feelings that they share with others. Communication does not go one way, but is reciprocal between the sender and the recipient of the message. The sender of the message can become the recipient of the message, and the recipient of the message can become the sender of the message. These roles can occur while the communication is taking place. Messages are ideas and feelings that are shared between sender and receiver. The essence of a communication event is the message, an intention or idea to be conveyed. Factors that affect a message being received are clarity, recipient readiness, complexity, message length, and organized information. Ideas and feelings are communicated when they are represented by symbols. The symbol consists of two, namely verbal and nonverbal symbols. Verbal symbols are limited and complex, while nonverbal symbols can be in the form of facial expressions, gestures, body postures, tone of voice, appearance and others. Feedback is the response given by the recipient and sender of the message in a communication event.

Unpleasant conditions can interfere with the recipient and sender of the message in understanding the message being conveyed. Internal disturbances occur in the mind of the receiver and sender of the message. If the sender and recipient of the message do not focus on the message or communication that is taking place, then the message cannot be understood or conveyed as it should. For example, a student doesn't listen to his lecturer, because when the lecturer is teaching, the student is thinking about lunch. Semantic disturbances are caused by the participants' emotional reactions to the words used. Participants usually have negative reactions to people who make statements.

This building was first built around 850 AD by Rakai Pikatan and was continuously refined and expanded by King Lokapala and king Sri Maharaja Dyah Balitung Maha Sambu. Based on the Siwagrha inscription dated 856 AD, this sacred building was built to glorify the god Shiva, and the original name of this building in Sanskrit is Siwagrha (Sanskrit: Shiva-grha which means: 'House of Shiva') or Siwalaya (Sanskrit: Shiva-laya which means means: 'The Realm of Shiva' or 'The Realm of Shiva'). In this inscription it is stated that when the construction of the Siwagrha temple was in progress, public works were also carried out to change the water system to divert the flow of the river near this temple. The river in question is the Opaque river that flows from north to south along the western side of the Prambanan temple complex. Historians suspect that originally the flow of this river curved to the east, and was considered too close to the temple so that river erosion could endanger the construction of the temple. This water management project was carried out by creating a new river channel that cuts the river curve in a north-south axis along the west wall outside the temple complex. The former watershed of the original river was then filled in to provide a wider area for the construction of a row of perwara temples (guard temples or accompanying temples).",

        "paragraph": "Some archaeologists argue that the Shiva statue in the garbhagriha (main room) in the Shiva temple as the main temple is a statue embodiment of King Balitung, as the statue of his posthumous pedharmaan. This building complex was periodically perfected by the following Medang Mataram kings, such as the kings Sri Maharaja Dyah Daksa and Sri Maharaja Dyah Tulodong, and expanded by building hundreds of additional temples around the main temple. Because of the splendor of this temple, Prambanan temple served as the grand temple of the Mataram Kingdom, where various important royal ceremonies were held. At the height of its heyday, historians suspect that hundreds of Brahmin priests and their students gathered and inhabited the outer courtyard of this temple to study the Vedas and carry out various Hindu rituals and ceremonies. While the center of the kingdom or royal palace of Mataram is thought to be located somewhere near Prambanan on the Kewu Plain. Around the 930s, the royal capital was moved to East Java by Sri Maharaja Mpu Sindok, who founded the Isyana Dynasty. The reason for the transfer of this center of power is not known with certainty. However, it is very possible that it was caused by the violent eruption of Mount Merapi which towered about 20 kilometers north of Prambanan temple. Other possible causes are wars and power struggles. After the transfer of the capital city, the Prambanan temple began to be neglected and not maintained, so that this temple slowly began to break down and collapse. The building of this temple is thought to have completely collapsed due to a great earthquake in the 16th century. Even though it is no longer the center of religion and worship for Hindus, this temple is still recognized and known for its existence by the Javanese who inhabit the surrounding villages. The temples and Durga statues in the main building of this temple inspired the Javanese folk tale, the legend of Rara Jonggrang. After the split of the Mataram Sultanate in 1755, the ruins of the temple and the nearby Opak river became a dividing mark between the Yogyakarta Sultanate (Jogja) and Surakarta (Solo) Sunanate.",

Although Sir Thomas later ordered further investigation, the ruins of this temple remained abandoned for decades. No serious excavations were carried out during the 1880s which unfortunately only fostered the practice of looting the temple's carvings and stones. Then in 1855 Jan Willem IJzerman began cleaning and removing some stones and soil from the temple's cubicle. Moments later, Isaac Groneman carried out a major demolition and the stones of the temple were piled haphazardly along the Opak River. The statues and temple reliefs were taken by the Dutch and used as garden decorations, while the natives used temple stones for building materials and house foundations. Restoration began in 1918, but the real serious effort began in the 1930's. In 1902-1903, Theodoor van Erp maintained a section prone to collapse.

The substrate is converted into one or more products, which are then released from the active site. The active site is then free to accept other substrate molecules. In the case of more than one substrate, these may bind to the active site in a specific order, before reacting together to give the product. A substrate is called 'chromogenic' if it produces a colored product when acted upon by an enzyme. In histological enzyme localization studies, the colored products resulting from enzyme action can be seen under a microscope, in thin sections of biological tissue. For example, curd formation (rennet coagulation) is a reaction that occurs in the addition of the enzyme rennin to milk. In this reaction, the substrate is milk protein (casein) and the enzyme is rennin. The product is two polypeptides that have been formed by the breakdown of a larger peptide substrate. Another example is the chemical decomposition of hydrogen peroxide by the catalase enzyme. Because enzymes are catalysts, they are not changed by the reactions that take place. However, the substrate is converted to products. In this case, hydrogen peroxide is broken down into water and oxygen gas.",

Jawa) is an island in Indonesia which is located in the Greater Sunda archipelago and is the 13th largest island in the world. The population on the island of Java is around 150 million. Java Island is inhabited by 60% of Indonesia's total population. This figure decreased when compared to the population census in 1905 which reached 80.6% of the entire population of Indonesia. The decline in the population on the island of Java in percentage terms was due to the migration of people (transmigration) from the island of Java to other areas in Indonesia. The capital city of Indonesia is Jakarta and is located in the northwestern part of Java (precisely at the westernmost tip of the Pantura Line). Java is a relatively young island and was formed mostly from volcanic activity. Rows of volcanoes form a range that stretches from east to west of the island, with river alluvial plains in the north. Java Island is separated by straits with several main islands, namely Sumatra Island in the northwest, Kalimantan Island in the north, Madura Island in the northeast, and Bali Island in the east. Meanwhile to the south of the island of Java stretches the Indian Ocean. Many stories of Indonesian history took place on this island. In the past, Java was the center of several Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms, Islamic sultanates, the Dutch East Indies colonial government, and the center of the Indonesian independence movement. This island has had a major impact on Indonesia's social, political and economic life. Most of the population speaks three main languages. Javanese is the mother tongue of 100 million Indonesians, and most of its speakers live on the island of Java. Most of the population are bilingual, speaking Indonesian as either their first or second language. Two other important languages \u200b\u200bare Sundanese and Betawi.",

The island is administratively divided into six provinces, namely West Java, Central Java, East Java and Banten, as well as two special regions, namely DKI Jakarta and DI Yogyakarta. The origin of the name \"Java\" can be traced from the Sanskrit chronicles which mention an island called yavadvip(a) (dvipa means \"island\", and yava means \"barley\" or also \"grain\"). Whether this grain is millet (Setaria italica) or rice, both have been found in abundance on this island in the period before the arrival of Indian influence. It is possible that this island has had many previous names, including possibly derived from the word ja\u00fa meaning \"far off\". Yavadvipa is mentioned in the Indian epic, Ramayana. Sugriwa, the commander of the wanara (ape man) of Sri Rama's army, sent his envoy to Yavadvipa (Java Island) to look for Dewi Sita. Then based on Indian literature, especially Tamil literature, it is called the Sanskrit name y\u0101vaka dv\u012bpa (dv\u012bpa = island). Another suggestion is that the word \"Java\" comes from the root word in the Proto-Austronesian language which means \"home\". The island named Iabadiu or Jabadiu is mentioned in Ptolemy's work called Geographia which was made around 150 AD in the Roman Empire. Iabadiu is said to mean \"island of barley\", was also rich in gold, and had a silver city called Argyra in the far west. This name indicates Java, and seems to derive from the Hindu name Yavadvipa (Island of Java). Annual reports from the Songshu and Liangshu refer to Java as She-po (5th century AD), He-ling (640-818 AD), then call it She-po again until the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368), where they started chanting Zhao-Wa (\u722a\u54c7). :12 According to the records of Ma Huan (ie Yingya Shenlan), the Chinese called Java Chao-Wa, and this island was formerly called \u9607\u5a46 (She-p\u00f3 or She-b\u00f3).",

In the 4th century BC to the 1st or 5th century AD, the Buni culture, namely the clay pottery culture, developed on the north coast of West Java. This protohistoric culture was the predecessor of the Tarumanagara kingdom. The island of Java, which is very fertile and has high rainfall, has allowed the development of rice cultivation in wetlands, thus encouraging the formation of increasingly complex levels of inter-village cooperation. From these village alliances, small kingdoms developed. The range of volcanic mountains and the surrounding highlands that stretch along the island of Java causes the interior areas of this island and its people to be relatively separated from outside influences. In the period before the development of Islamic countries and the arrival of European colonialism, the existing rivers were the main means of communication for the people, although most of the rivers in Java were short-lived.

This story tells of events in the Medang Kamulan kingdom in Java in the past. At that time, Raja Medang Kamulan Prabu Dewata Cengkar was replaced by Aji Saka. This story is considered as an allegory of the entry of the Indians into Java.

Raden Wijaya founded Majapahit, and his power reached its peak during the reign of Hayam Wuruk (r. 1350-1389). The kingdom claimed sovereignty over the entire Indonesian archipelago, although direct control tended to be limited to Java, Bali and Madura. Gajah Mada was the mahapatih during the time of Hayam Wuruk, who led many territorial conquests for the kingdom. Kingdoms in Java previously based their power on agriculture. But Majapahit managed to control the ports and shipping lanes so that it became the first commercial empire in Java. Majapahit experienced a setback with the death of Hayam Wuruk and the arrival of Islam to Indonesia. By the end of the 16th century, the development of Islam had surpassed Hinduism and Buddhism as the dominant religions in Java.

An expedition under the leadership of Cornelis de Houtman consisting of four ships in 1596, became the beginning of relations between the Netherlands and Indonesia. By the end of the 18th century, the Dutch had succeeded in expanding their influence over the sultanates in the interior of Java (see Dutch East India Company in Indonesia). Although the Javanese were brave warriors, internal conflict had prevented them from forming an effective alliance against the Dutch.

Others argue that the increasing tax burden and the increasing recruitment of workers under the Cultivation System caused couples to try to have more children in the hope of increasing the number of family members who could help pay taxes and earn a living. In 1820, there was a cholera outbreak in Java which killed 100,000 people. The presence of trucks and trains as a means of transportation for people who previously only used trains and buffalo, the use of a telegraph system, and a more regular distribution system under colonial rule; all of which contributed to the end of hunger in Java, which in turn increased population growth.

Previously, the earth's crust that formed this island was below sea level. Intense orogenic activity since the Oligocene and Miocene raised the seabed so that during the Pliocene and Pleistocene the shape of Java Island had begun to form. Remnants of the seabed are still visible, forming a feature of most of the karst area in the south of the island. Van Bemmelen divided the island of Java into seven physiographic units as follows.

        "paragraph": "Samadhi (Sanskrit: \u0938\u092e\u093e\u0927\u093f) is a high-level ritual of concentration, transcending the awareness of the physical realm found in Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism, and yoga schools. Samadhi is also the highest phase in the eight phases of Yoga mastery. When entering the samadhi phase, analytical and logical faculties become dysfunctional or stagnant. According to the Bhargava Dictionary, Samadhi is the strongest phase of yoga in which a person gains the power to suspend the connection between body and soul for as long as He likes. Samadhi is also understood as a part of religious ritual, as opposed to meditation or meditation, both of which are concentration training practices used outside of religious rituals. In terms of awareness, it is described that samadhi emphasizes non-duality, in which the subject's consciousness becomes one with the object experienced or that exists outside of it, and at this very moment the mind becomes still, focused on one thing or concentrated while one remains aware. Whereas in Buddhism, it can also refer to a submissive state in which the mind becomes very still and completely disengaged with the object of attention, thereby gaining insight and a stream of changes regarding experience. The word samadhi is first used in Sanskrit literature in the Maitri Upanishad. The word samadhi itself generally means \"concentration\" or \"not distracted\", while in terms of raising awareness by doing meditation. Then, we traced the etymology of the word originating from the Pali language which is a combination of the prefix sam (meaning \"unity\" or \"integration\"), a (\"toward\"), and finally dha (\"achievement of goals or intellect\"). Another opinion says samadhi is a verb from samadahati which means \"put everything, concentrate, combine\" everything that is in the mind or mind.",

        "paragraph": "Another opinion says that the meaning of the word samadhi is a state of balance (sama) and human intellectual detachment (dhi). In addition, this term can also be interpreted as uniformity (sam) and determination (dhi) which means to determine oneself to be fully uniform in one's true self-awareness. So from this etymology it can be concluded that samadhi is an attempt to obtain the whole, the goal, or the truth (samapatti). In Hinduism, Samadhi is part of the religious ritual procedures described in the Yoga Sutras in the first chapter entitled Samadhi-pada. Likewise, Vyasa, an influential figure in Hinduism and also the author of the Mahabharata, explained that samadhi is the same as yoga from a practical point of view. In addition, Hindu teachings also do not only emphasize the concept of samadhi as a state of peace without content, but rather a person changes his consciousness to focus on feeling happy and serene following the flow of life. In Hindu teachings, samadhi is divided into five levels: laya samadhi, savikalpa samadhi, nirvikalpa samadhi, sahaja samadhi, and mahasamadhi. At the first level of laya samadhi one recognizes for the first time the form of peace and happiness through singing, dancing, or other daily activities. In this phase a person begins to grow and recognize the potential talent within him to continue samadhi to the next level. In the second level, savikalpa samadhi, the meditator will experience the sensations of space and time travel differently. During these periods of samadhi, the meditator tries to understand the consummation of samadhi. All kinds of feelings and thoughts flooded into his mind, but he consciously put them out. The third is Nirvikalpa Samadhi, in which the yogi will experience the pinnacle of great bliss. He felt as if the world and everything in it was following him.",

People in this phase are also reported to have difficulty communicating like ordinary humans. The fourth is Sahaja Samadhi, which is a supremacy phase of samadhi, in which the meditator has completely mastered the spiritual world and has difficulty understanding the material world. When experiencing sahaja samadhi one will feel close to the substance of the almighty. The fifth is mahasamadhi, this is the final phase in which the meditator has completely left his body and gone to merge with God. Practicing samadhi requires readiness and strong will, and maintaining purity is even more difficult. Basic levels of samadhi such as laya and savikalpa are temporary and can be erased in a short time. Difficulties in attaining or maintaining the level of samadhi are caused by disturbances from within oneself such as emotions and thoughts. On the other hand, people who have taken samadhi teachings to the level of nirvikalpa must also maintain their awareness in the real world. Therefore a person who wants to learn samadhi should seek the help of a spiritual teacher called dhamma. Samadhi mandir is a term in Hinduism which means a temple to commemorate a teacher who was able to reach the level of mahasamadhi, or in the sense of those who have passed away but never entered the samadhi stage during their lifetime. In this case they are respected as people who managed to reach the stage of true samadhi, merging with God by dying. In independent samadhi itself, sometimes there are buried corpses or no corpses at all, because its main function is only as a place to honor the teacher of samadhi rituals.",

From the manuscript sources found, the teachings regarding samadhi were explained in: Buddhist teachings say that if a person experiences an increase in doing samadhi, his soul and mind will be clean from all stains, more calm, peaceful, and radiant. Moreover, if the meditator has strong powers of concentration then his mind is ready to see the true truth of the whole world. It's just that, in Buddhism, worldly happiness is not the main goal in doing Samadhi, but still it is a tool to gain enlightenment. As the knowledge of samadhi developed, the Buddhist school began to open up to different kinds of samadhi meditation in order to achieve a degree of inner calm rather than acquiring true knowledge. However, the development of the samadhi teachings brought by each school does not deviate from the Four Foundations of Peace in Buddhism, which are called Jhana. Buddhist scriptures, suttas mention that practitioners who do samadhi can increase their supernatural powers (the power is called abhijna or siddhis), it has been proven that there are several monks who get supernatural powers. Even so, doing samadhi for the sake of gaining magical benefits is absolutely not permissible, because doing so could deviate from the main goal of gaining liberation from suffering in the world. Samadhi in the teachings of the Sikh religion refers to rituals performed to remember and focus on one god: Waheguru. For followers of the Sikh religion, samadhi is done solely with devotion to their god. They have to contemplate more often or put God into the deepest core of their heart, so that sometimes they feel that they are together with their god.

While singing I am in samadhi calling on my god.\u201d Brain waves vary depending on the level of consciousness that the individual achieves. When a person is fully aware of everything in their environment, or thinking about something, their brain is in beta. Then when he contemplates about many things and thinks focused on something, the brain waves decrease in the Alpha position, if they fall again then they change to Theta. Lastly is the Delta position, a level where the brain is very calm. This condition is usually experienced when people fall asleep very soundly, not dreaming. People whose brains enter into Delta waves in a conscious state are believed to be experienced or practitioners, because this phase is very difficult to achieve. This position is found in individuals who enter samadhi. Until now modern science and technology has not been able to explain the strange phenomena that occur in the meditator's body when doing samadhi. However, actually Hindu scientists have been trying to explain the phenomenon of samadhi for years. The scientists and religionists who contributed to this were: Shiv Puran Shiv Puran is one of the figures from India who explained the phenomenon of Samadhi within a person.

Hath Yog Pradipika The text of Yog Hath Pradipika explains that one who does samadhi transcends consciousness and all kinds of feelings, mental and physical. A yogi who is in a state of samadhi awareness inside and outside himself is neutralized to zero, turning into absolute calm. This absolute calm is like a lifeless body. Patanjali Yogdarshanam and Mahopanishad Mahopanishad argue that when the samadhi phase appears all thoughts and ambitions disappear leaving no trace. A yogi is not aware of whether he is sleeping, dreaming, or self-aware because they are in a perfect state. Then according to Yogdarshanam, when the whole body and natural existence appear calm, then one has reached the samadhi phase. Scientific research In a study, using electrograms, it was found that the heartbeat and biological electricity in the yogi's body when he is in the samadhi phase are really weak and tend to stop beating. This was proven in his research on a 60 year old man who had done samadhi underground for eight days.

The best place for growing teak is soil with a pH of 4.5 \u2013 7 and not flooded with water. Teak has wide, elliptical leaves that can reach 30 \u2013 60\u00a0cm when mature. Teak has a slow growth rate with low germination (usually less than 50%) which makes the natural propagation process difficult so that it is not enough to cover the demand for teak wood. Teak is usually produced conventionally using seeds. However, the production of large quantities of seed over a period of time is limited due to the hard outer layer of the seed. Several alternatives have been made to overcome this coating such as soaking the seeds in water, heating the seeds over low heat or hot sand, and adding acids, bases, or bacteria. However, this alternative is still not optimal to produce teak in a fast time and in large quantities. Generally, teak which is in the nursery process is susceptible to several diseases including leaf spot disease caused by Phomopsis sp., Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Alternaria sp., and Curvularia sp., leaf rust caused by Olivea tectonea, and powdery mildew caused by Uncinula tectonae.",

As the most extensive forest type on the island of Java, teak forests have important economic, ecological and social values. Javanese teak wood has been used since the time of the Majapahit Kingdom. Teak is mainly used for building houses and agricultural implements. Until the Second World War, the Javanese generally only knew teak wood as a building material. Non-teak wood is called 'year wood'. That is, wood that lasts only a few years. In addition, teak is used in building commercial ships and warships. Several areas adjacent to teak forests on the north coast of Java were once shipyard centers, such as Tegal, Juwana, Tuban and Pasuruan. However, the largest and most familiar shipyards are in Jepara and Rembang, as noted by the adventurer Tom\u00e9 Pires in the early 16th century. The VOC (Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie, Dutch East India Company) was even so interested in this \"green gold\" that they insisted on building their first lodge on the island of Java\u2014in Jepara to be exact\u2014in 1651.",

This was because they thought the teak trade would be far more profitable than the world spice trade, which at that time was reaching its golden peak. In the middle of the 18th century, the VOC was able to cut teak in a more modern way. And, in return for their military assistance to the Mataram Kingdom in the early 19th century, the VOC was also granted permission to log large areas of teak forest. The VOC then obliged the native leaders to hand over a certain amount of teak wood to the VOC. Through the blandong system, these bumiputera leaders impose logging on the people around the forest. In return, the people are freed from other tax obligations. So, the blandong system is a form of forced labour. The VOC then brought back the Java teak logs to Amsterdam and Rotterdam. The last two port cities have also developed into world-class shipping industry centers. On the north coast of Java itself, the shipyards of Jepara and Rembang remained busy until the mid-19th century. They went out of business only after many shipping entrepreneurs of Arab descent chose to live in Surabaya. After all, at that time ships were mostly made of metal and didn't rely much on wood. However, after the independence of this country, Javanese teak was still very profitable. Teak production during the golden period 1984-1988 reached 800,000 m3/year. Exports of teak logs in 1989 reached 46,000 m3, with a basic selling price of 640 USD/m3. In 1990, the export of teak logs was banned by the government because the demand for the domestic forestry industry was soaring. However, Perhutani noted that around 80% of their revenue from sales of all types of timber in 1999 came from selling teak logs domestically.",

Teak leaves are used traditionally in Java as wrappers, including food wrappers. Rice wrapped in teak leaves tastes better. An example is the famous jamblang rice from the Jamblang area, Cirebon. Teak leaves are also widely used in Yogyakarta, Central Java and East Java as tempe wrappers. Various types of teak insect pests are also often used as food ingredients for villagers. Two of them are the teak locust (Jw. walang kayu), which is large brown in color, and the teak caterpillar (Hyblaea puera). Teak caterpillars are often even considered special food because of their delicious taste. These caterpillars are collected before the rainy season, in the morning when the caterpillars are hanging down from the trees to find a place to form cocoons (Jw. ungkrung). The teak caterpillar cocoons are also collected and eaten. If we visit teak forests in Java, we will see that these areas have other economic functions besides producing teak wood. Many pesantren (farmers) who live in teak forest villages use teak tree bark as the material for the walls of their homes. Teak leaves, which are wide and hairy and fall during the dry season, they use as food and goods wrapping. Teak branches and twigs become fuel for many households in teak forest villages. Teak forests mainly provide arable land. Between the teak trees, farmers plant crops in rows. From the teak forests themselves, they can obtain additional income in the form of honey, a number of carbohydrate food sources, and medicines. Food substitutes for rice that grow in teak forests, for example, are gadung (Dioscorea hispida) and uwi (Dioscorea alata).",

The teak tree also produces clusters of whitish flowers which open shortly after dawn. The best pollination period for teak flowers occurs around the center of the heart \u2014each flower lives for only one day. Pollination of flowers is carried out by many insects, but especially by types of bees. Therefore, residents are also often able to harvest bee honey from teak forests. The people of teak forest villages in Java are also used to raising livestock such as buffalo, cows and goats. This type of livestock requires grass as feed. Although it is sometimes easy for farmers to find grass in the fields or fields, they mostly use forest land as a source of fodder for livestock. By simply releasing livestock into the forest, livestock will get the various types of feed they need. Time that is not used by farming families to collect grass can be used for other activities. In 2003, around 76% of Perhutani's teak forest land in Java was confirmed as production forest, namely forest areas with the main function of producing forest products (mainly timber). Only less than 24% of Perhutani's teak forests are gazetted as protection forests, nature reserves, tourism forests and nature reserves. Given the relatively large area of \u200b\u200bland, teak forests are seen as having important non-economic functions. These non-economic functions are as follows: The canopy of trees in a teak forest will absorb and decompose pollutant substances (pollutants) and excess light. The forest canopy also carries out the process of photosynthesis which absorbs carbon dioxide from the air and releases oxygen and water vapor back into the air.",

        "paragraph": "All of this helps maintain climate stability in and around the forest. Teak forests also support soil fertility. This is because the roots of the trees in the teak forest grow wide and deep. The growth of these roots will help loosen the soil, making it easier for water and air to enter it. The crowns (green crowns) of trees and undergrowth in a teak forest will produce litter, which is the dropping of twigs, fruit and flowers from plants that cover the surface of the forest soil. Litter becomes the basic material for producing soil humus. Various living microorganisms shelter and thrive in this litter. Interestingly, these microorganisms will also eat and break down litter into soil humus. Litter also helps to dampen the raindrops thus protecting the soil from erosion by water. If the teak forest is in the form of pure forest \u2014so it is more like a teak 'garden'\u2014 soil erosion will actually occur more. Teak crowns are greedy for sunlight so their branches shouldn't touch. Teak roots also cannot compete with other plant roots. Thus, soil litter tends to be less. Without much plant cover on the forest floor, the topsoil is more easily carried away by running water and wind. Fortunately, teak forests are thriving with a much wider variety of plants. In the teak forests, we can find bungur (Lagerstroemia speciosa), dlingsem (Homalium tomentosum), dluwak (Grewia paniculata), katamaka (Kleinhovia hospita), kemloko (Phyllanthus emblica), Kepuh (Sterculia foetida), kesambi (Schleichera oleosa), laban (Vitex pubscens), ploso (Butea monosperma), shaved (Streblus asper), trengguli (Cassia fistula), winong (Tetrameles nudflora), and others. Lamtoro (Leucenia leucocephalla) and acacia (Acacia villosa) are also planted as intercrops to prevent soil erosion and increase soil fertility.

The Gunung Kidul area has now turned into green land with cooler climates and higher biodiversity. This environmental change has invited many animals to stop by, especially birds \u2014animals that are often used as indicators of the health of an environment. In addition, this land wealth is also a resource reserve for the future. Many teak forest lands in Java, both gazetted as production and non-production forests, serve as research and education centers, nature monitoring centers, recreation and tourism sites, and cultural development resources. Perhaps the most interesting to visit is the Gubug Payung Monument in Cepu, Blora, Central Java.

It is a rare radioactive transuranium element and is an actinide metal with a silvery-white appearance. When exposed to air, it tarnishes due to the formation of plutonium(IV) oxide covering the metal surface. This element basically has six allotropes and four oxidation states. It reacts with carbon, halogens, nitrogen and silicon. When exposed to humidity, it forms oxides and hydrides with a volume of 70% larger and becomes a spontaneously igniting powder. It is also a radiological poison that can accumulate in the bone marrow. Because of these properties, the handling of plutonium is quite hazardous, although the overall toxicity of the metal is sometimes exaggerated. The most important isotope of plutonium is plutonium-239 which has a half-life of 24,100 years. Plutonium-239 is fissile, that is, it can split apart when bombarded by thermal neutrons, releasing more energy, gamma radiation, and neutrons. Therefore, it can maintain the nuclear chain reaction after reaching critical mass. These properties allow plutonium to be used as a nuclear weapon and used in several nuclear reactors. The most stable isotope of plutonium is plutonium-244, with a half-life of about 80 million years. This half-life is long enough to be found naturally in small quantities. Plutonium-238 has a half-life of 88 years and emits alpha particles. It is the heat source in radioisotope thermoelectric generators (used in some spacecraft). Plutonium-240 has a high spontaneous fission rate which will increase the level of background neutrons in the sample. The presence of Pu-240 will limit the power and weapon potential of a sample. It is also used as a benchmark for determining plutonium grades: weapons grade (< 7%), fuel grade (7\u201319%), and reactor grade (> 19%).",

Element 94 was first synthesized by a group of scientists led by Glenn T. Seaborg and Edwin McMillan at the University of California, Berkeley in 1940. McMillan later named the new element plutonium (after Pluto). The discovery of plutonium later became a key part of the Manhattan Project to develop the atomic bomb during World War II. The first nuclear test, \"Trinity\" (July 1945), and the second atomic bomb (\"Fat Man\") used to destroy the city of Nagasaki (August 1945) had a Pu-239 core. Like many other metals, plutonium has a shiny silver appearance. However, when exposed to air, plutonium(IV) oxide forms rapidly and turns the metal a dull gray. In addition, yellow and olive green have also been reported. At room temperature, plutonium exists in its alpha allotopic form. This allotropic form is the most common form and has the hardness level of cast iron, except when it is alloyed with other metals and makes it soft and can be easily deformed. Unlike most metals, plutonium is not a very good conductor of heat and electricity. It has a low melting point (640\u00b0C) and a very high boiling point (3.327\u00b0C). Alpha particle emission, which is the release of high-energy helium nuclei, is the most common form of radiation emitted by plutonium. The heat released during the release and deceleration of these alpha particles makes softball-sized plutonium feel warm to the touch, whereas for plutonium's larger mass, it can boil a liter of water in a matter of minutes (which varies depending on the isotope composition).",

This trend of increasing resistivity will continue up to 100 K. Below this temperature, the resistivity will decrease drastically. When the temperature drops to 20 K, the resistivity increases again due to radiation damage (the rate of increase corresponds to the isotope composition). Because of plutonium's self-irradiation, it will exhibit fatigue (fatigue) throughout its crystal structure, meaning that the arrangement of atoms in the crystal will be disrupted by the radiation over time. However, self-irradiation can also cause softening which can offset some of the fatigue effects when the temperature is increased above 100 K. Plutonium generally has six allotropes. At elevated temperatures and certain pressure ranges, a seventh allotrope (zeta, \u03b6) can be formed. These allotropes have nearly the same energy levels, but very different densities and crystal structures. This makes plutonium very sensitive to changes in temperature, pressure, and chemical environment. In addition, dramatic volume changes during phase transitions from one allotrope to another are also possible. Unlike many other materials, the density of plutonium increases when it melts (by 2.5%). However, liquid metallic plutonium itself shows a linear decrease in density as temperature increases. The densities of the various allotropes of plutonium range from 16.00 g/cm3 to 19.86 g/cm3. The presence of many of these allotropes makes plutonium processing very difficult. For example the \u03b1 form of plutonium forms at room temperature and it has characteristics similar to cast iron, but it becomes plastic and easily deformed when it converts to the \u03b2 (beta) allotrope at slightly higher temperatures.",

Plutonium in the \u03b4 (delta) form is generally formed in the temperature range of 310\u00b0C to 452\u00b0C, but it is stable at room temperature when alloyed with low percentages of gallium, aluminum, or cerium. The delta form of plutonium has properties that are more similar to those of metals in general. It is about as strong and soft as aluminum. Plutonium is a radioactive metal actinide. The isotope plutonium-239 (Pu-239) is one of the three main fissile isotopes (the rest are uranium-233 and uranium-235). To be considered fissile, the atomic nucleus of an isotope must be able to fission when bombarded by a neutron and release a sufficient number of additional neutrons to sustain the nuclear chain reaction by further breaking the nucleus. Pu-239 has a positive multiplication factor (k). This means that if the metal is available in sufficient mass and in the correct geometric shape, it can form a critical mass. During fission, some of the binding energy that holds the nucleus together is released as large amounts of heat energy, kinetic energy, and electromagnetic energy. One kilogram of Pu-239 can generate an explosion equivalent to 20,000 tons of TNT. This enormous amount of energy makes Pu-239 very useful in reactors and nuclear weapons. The presence of the isotope plutonium-240 (Pu-240) in a sample will limit the potential of a plutonium nuclear bomb. This is because Pu-240 has a high spontaneous fission rate (~440 fissions per second per gram for every 1,000 neutrons per second per gram), thereby increasing the level of background neutrons, which in turn increases the risk of predetonation.

The remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives of less than 7,000 years. The element also has eight metastable states, although none are completely stable and have a half-life of less than one second. The isotopes of plutonium have mass numbers that range from 228 to 247. The main decay modes of the isotope with a lower mass number than the most stable isotope Pu-244 are spontaneous fission and alpha emission. Most will be isotopes of uranium (92 protons) and neptunium (93 protons) as decay products (ignoring the daughter nuclei produced during fission). The main decay mode of isotopes that have a higher mass number than Pu-244 is beta emission, most of which are americium (95 protons) isotopes as decay products. Pu-241 is the parent isotope of the neptunium decay series, decaying to americium-241 via both beta and electron emission. Pu-238 and Pu-239 are the most frequently synthesized isotopes.

Different isotopes produce different heat per mass. The heat of decay is usually expressed in watts/kilograms or milliwatts/grams. In large amounts of plutonium and insufficient heat dissipation this heat can have a significant impact. All isotopes produce weak gammas as they decay. At room temperature, pure plutonium is silver in color and it tarnishes when oxidized. The element exhibits four ionic oxidation states in solution: The color of the solution exhibited by plutonium solutions depends on the oxidation state and the properties of the acidic anion.

It will be attacked by acids, oxygen, and steam, but not by alkalis and will dissolve readily in concentrated hydrochloric, iodic, and perchloric acids.

The entire weapon weighs over 4 tonnes, even though the plutonium used in the core only weighs 6.2 kg. About 20% of the plutonium used in the Trinity gun undergoes fission, resulting in an explosion with an energy equivalent to approximately 20,000 tons of TNT.note 7] An identical design was used in the \"Fat Man\" atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki, Japan on August 9, 1945, killing 70,000 people and injured another 100,000.",

Japan surrendered unconditionally on August 15, effectively ending the war. Only after the announcement of the first atomic bomb was the existence of the element plutonium made public. Large stockpiles of weapons-grade plutonium were produced by the Soviet Union and the United States during the Cold War. US reactors at Hanford and the Savannah River Site in South Carolina produced 103\u00a0tons of plutonium, and an estimated 170 tonnes were produced in Russia. note 8] Annually, about 20 tonnes of the element is still produced as a by-product of the nuclear power industry. Some 1,000 tons of plutonium are still in storage, of which 200 tons are in or extracted from nuclear weapons. Since the end of the World War, this plutonium stockpile has become a major focus of nuclear proliferation. In the United States, some of the plutonium extracted from disassembled nuclear weapons is melted down into two-ton plutonium oxide glass spools. This glass is made from borosilicate mixed with cadmium and gadolinium. note 9] The logs are planned to be covered with steel and stored in a 4 km underground pit supported by concrete. As of 2008, only the Mount Yucca nuclear waste repository was slated to store plutonium in this way. Opposition to this plan has delayed efforts to store nuclear waste at Mount Yucca. During and after the end of World War II, scientists involved in the Manhattan Project and other nuclear weapons research projects conducted various studies of the effects of plutonium on animals and humans. In animal studies, it was found that a few milligrams of plutonium per kilogram of body tissue is a lethal dose.",

The concentration of this injection was lowered to one microgram in July 1945 after data from animal experiments, it was found that the way plutonium distributes itself in bones was more dangerous than radium. Eighteen human test subjects were injected with plutonium without their knowledge. This experiment was carried out to develop a diagnostic tool that can determine the level of absorption of plutonium in the body, so that a safety standard for work involving plutonium can be developed. Today, human experimentation is considered a serious violation of medical ethics and the Hippocratic Oath. Because of the ease with which the isotope Pu-239 undergoes fission and its availability, it is a key fissile component in the manufacture of nuclear weapons. Encasing the solid plutonium sphere with a compactor (an additional layer made of solid materials) decreases the amount of plutonium required to reach critical mass by bouncing back any escaped neutrons back into the plutonium core. This would lower the amount of plutonium required from 16 kg to 10 kg, in the form of a 10 cm diameter ball. This critical mass is about one third that of U-235. The \"Fat Man\" plutonium bombs produced during the Manhattan Project used explosive compression of plutonium to obtain a greater than normal density of plutonium and combined it with a neutron source to initiate the reaction and increase efficiency.

Weapon-grade plutonium can then be added to the fuel mixture. MOX fuel is used in light water reactors and contains 60 kg of plutonium per tonne of fuel. After four years, three-fourths of the plutonium will have been used up (turned into another element). Breeder reactors are specifically designed to obtain fissile material at a rate faster than the rate at which the material is consumed. MOX fuel has been used since the 1980s and is widely used in Europe. In September 2000, the United States and Russia signed a Plutonium Management and Disposition Agreement in which each side agreed to dispose of 34 tons of weapons-grade plutonium. The US Department of Energy plans to dispose of 34 tons of weapons-grade plutonium by the end of 2019 by converting it into MOX fuel that can be used in commercial nuclear reactors. Efficiency can also be achieved through reprocessing, in which the fuel rods are processed to remove waste products which account for up to 3% of the total weight of the rods after three years of use. Any uranium and plutonoum isotopes produced during those three years were abandoned and the rods returned to use. note 10] However, the presence of 1% gallium per mass of weapons-grade plutonium has the potential to limit the long-term operation of light water reactors. 241Am has recently been proposed for use as a detanurating agent for reactor fuel rods by rendering the fuel unusable for nuclear weapons conversion.",

It emits a large amount of thermal energy with low levels of emission of gamma rays and spontaneous neutron particles. As an alpha emitter, it emits high-energy radiation with a low penetration rate, requiring minimal shielding. A sheet of paper can be used to shield the alpha particles emitted by Pu-238, while one kilogram of this isotope can produce 22 million kilowatt hours of heat energy. These properties make the isotope Pu-238 very suitable for use as a source of electricity for equipment that must function without direct maintenance for the entire human lifetime. As a result, it is used in radioisotope thermoelectric generators and radioisotope heating units used in the space exploration missions Cassini, Voyager and New Horizons. Plutonium-238 has also been used successfully to power artificial cardiac pacemakers, thereby reducing the risk of re-surgery. It has generally been replaced with lithium-based primary cells. However, until 2003, there were still around 50 to 100 plutonium-powered cardiac pacemakers that were still implanted and functioning. Plutonium-238 mixed with beryllium is used to generate neutrons for research purposes. Isotopes and compounds of plutonium are highly toxic because of their radioactivity. From a chemical toxicity point of view, arsenic and cyanide are more toxic than plutonium, and plutonium is just as toxic as caffeine. Plutonium is more dangerous when inhaled than ingested. The risk of lung cancer increases once the inhaled radiation exceeds 400 mSv. It will not be absorbed into the body efficiently if ingested; only about 0.04% of plutonium oxide is absorbed after ingestion. When plutonium is absorbed into the body, it is excreted very slowly, with a half-life of 200 years.",

The bodies most at risk from irradiation are the bones (where it is most likely to be absorbed onto the bone surface) and the liver (where it collects and becomes concentrated). Plutonium in very large quantities can cause acute radiation poisoning and death if swallowed or inhaled; however, until now not a single human is known to have died from inhaling or ingesting plutonium. In addition, many people have small amounts of detectable plutonium in their bodies. In addition to the problem of plutonium toxicity, the accumulation of plutonium reaching a critical mass must also be avoided, especially since the critical mass of plutonium is only one third of the critical mass of uranium-235. Plutonium that reaches a critical mass will emit a number of neutrons and gamma rays in lethal levels. Plutonium in solution is more likely to form a critical mass than plutonium in solid form. In its history, there have been several accidents involving the formation of this critical mass. Careless handling of a tungsten carbide brick placed in a 6.2 kg plutonium sphere caused a fatal dose of radiation on August 21, 1945 at Los Alamos, which scientist Harry K. Daghlian, Jr. received a dose estimated to be equivalent to 5.1 Sievert and died 28 days afterward. Nine months later, another Los Alamos scientist, Louis Slotin, also died in an accident involving a beryllium reflector and the same plutonium core that had previously caused Daghlian's death (the plutonium ball was later nicknamed the \"demon core\").

        "paragraph": "A chromosome is a long DNA molecule that contains part or all of an organism's genetic material. Most chromosomes in eukaryotes have packaging proteins called histones which, assisted by chaperone proteins, bind and condense the DNA molecule to maintain its integrity. These chromosomes display a complex three-dimensional structure, which plays an important role in the regulation of transcription. Chromosomes are normally visible under the light microscope only during the metaphase of cell division (when all the chromosomes line up in the center of the cell in a condensed or condensed form). Before this occurs, each chromosome is duplicated (S phase) and the two copies are joined by the centromere to form an X-shaped structure (if the centromere is located at the equator) or form a two-armed structure (if the centromere is located at the edge). These joined copies are now called sister chromatids. During metaphase, X-shaped structures called metaphase chromosomes are highly condensed making them easy to distinguish and study. In animal cells, chromosomes reach their highest degree of condensation during anaphase during the chromosome segregation process. Chromosomal recombination during meiosis and sexual reproduction plays an important role in genetic diversity. If chromosomes are manipulated improperly, through processes known as chromosomal instability and translocation, cells can undergo mitotic catastrophe. Normally, this would cause the cell to initiate apoptosis leading to its own death, but sometimes mutations within the cell impede this process and lead to the development of cancer. Some people use the term chromosome in a broader sense, to refer to the individual parts of chromatin in a cell, both visible and invisible under a light microscope. Others use the concept of chromosome in a narrower sense to refer to the individual parts of chromatin during cell division, which are visible under a light microscope due to their high condensation.",

The term was coined by German scientist von Waldeyer-Hartz, referring to the term chromatin introduced by Walther Flemming, the discoverer of cell division. German scientists Schleiden, Virchow, and B\u00fctschli were among the first scientists to recognize the structures now known as chromosomes. In a series of experiments beginning in the mid-1880s, Theodor Boveri made a definite contribution to explaining that chromosomes are vectors contributing to heredity, in the two senses that have come to be known as 'chromosomal continuity' and 'chromosomal individuality'. Wilhelm Roux suggested that each chromosome carried a different genetic configuration, and Boveri was able to test and confirm this hypothesis. Aided by the rediscovery in the early 1900s of Gregor Mendel's early work, Boveri was able to show the relationship between the rules of inheritance and the behavior of chromosomes. Boveri influenced two generations of American cytologists: Edmund Beecher Wilson, Nettie Stevens, Walter Sutton, and Theophilus Painter; all of whom were influenced by Boveri (Wilson, Stevens and Painter actually worked with him). In his famous textbook, Cells in Development and Heredity, Wilson linked the independent work of Boveri and Sutton (both c. 1902) by naming the chromosomal theory of inheritance the Boveri\u2013Sutton chromosome theory (the names are sometimes spelled backwards). Ernst Mayr comments that the theory was hotly debated by several well-known geneticists: William Bateson, Wilhelm Johannsen, Richard Goldschmidt, and T.H. Morgan, it all involves a somewhat oracular change of mind. Finally, complete proof came from a chromosome map in Morgan's own lab.

Prokaryotes\u2014bacteria and archaea\u2014usually have one circular chromosome, but there are many variations. The chromosomes of most bacteria, which some authors prefer to call genophores, can vary in size; ranging from 130,000 base pairs in the endosymbiotic bacteria Candidatus Hodgkinia cicadicola and Candidatus Tremblaya princeps, to more than 14,000,000 base pairs in the underground bacterium Sorangium cellulosum. Spirocketes of the genus Borrelia are notable exceptions, for example the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, the cause of Lyme disease, has a single linear chromosome. Prokaryotic chromosomes have less sequence-based structures than eukaryotes. Bacteria usually have a single point (origin of replication), where replication begins, whereas some archaea have multiple points of origin of replication. Genes in prokaryotes are often arranged by operons, and usually do not contain introns, unlike eukaryotes. Prokaryotes do not have a nucleus. Therefore, their DNA is organized into structures called nucleoids. Nucleoid is a special structure that occupies a certain area in the bacterial cell. This structure is dynamic and is maintained and remodeled by the action of various proteins such as histones, which associate with the bacterial chromosome. In archaea, the DNA in the chromosomes is even better organized; Their DNA is packaged in a structure similar to nucleosomes in eukaryotes. Certain bacteria also contain plasmids or other extrachromosomal DNA, which are circular structures in the cytoplasm that contain cellular DNA and play a role in horizontal gene transfer. In prokaryotes (see nucleoid) and viruses, the DNA is often tightly packed and organized; in the case of archaea, by eukaryotic histone homologues, and in the case of bacteria, by histone-like proteins.",

Like eukaryotic DNA, prokaryotic chromosomes and plasmids are generally supercoiled (highly coiled). First of all, DNA must be converted to the unraveled state to access transcription, regulation, and replication. Each chromosome of eukaryotic organisms consists of long linear DNA molecules linked to proteins, forming a dense protein and DNA complex called chromatin. Chromatin contains most of an organism's DNA, but small amounts of maternally inherited DNA can be found in mitochondria. Chromatin is found in almost all cells, with a few exceptions, such as red blood cells. Histones, a type of protein, are responsible for the first and most basic unit of chromosome organization, namely the nucleosome. Eukaryotic cells (nucleated cells such as those found in plants, fungi, and animals) have several large linear chromosomes contained in the nucleus. Each chromosome has a centromere, with one or two arms that can be seen protruding from the centromere, although in most circumstances these arms do not appear as such. In addition, most eukaryotes have small circular mitochondrial genomes, and some eukaryotes may have additional small circular or linear cytoplasmic chromosomes. In the chromosomes in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, the uncondensed DNA is in a semi-organized structure. It wraps around histones (structural proteins), forming a composite material called chromatin. Packaging of DNA into nucleosomes causes 10 nanometer fibers to condense and form 30 nm fibers. Most of the euchromatin during interphase appears in the form of 30 nm fibers. The chromatin structure is in a more decondensed state, namely the 10 nm conformation which allows transcription.",

This type of chromatin appears to serve a structural purpose during the chromosomal stage. Heterochromatin can be further distinguished into two types: (a) constitutive, never-expressed heterochromatin, which is located around the centromere and usually contains repeating sequences; and (b) facultative heterochromatin, which is occasionally expressed. In the early stages of mitosis or meiosis (cell division), the chromatin double helix becomes much more condensed. They stop functioning as accessible genetic material (transcription stops) and become a transportable solid form. Twists of 30 nm chromatin fibers are thought to fold further to form compact metaphase chromosomes in cells undergoing mitosis. DNA compaction is estimated to be about 10,000 times. Chromosomal scaffolds (supports) made of proteins such as condensin, TOP2A and KIF4, play an important role in holding chromatin into tightly packed chromosomes. The 30 nm spin structure is increasingly condensed, assisted by support proteins, forming a higher order structure. This very compact shape makes the individual chromosomes visible, and they form the classic four-armed structure, that is, a pair of sister chromatids attached to each other at the centromere. The shorter arm is called the p arm (from French petit, small) and the longer arm is called the q arm (q follows p in the Latin alphabet; qg \"grande\"; alternatively it is sometimes said that q is short for queue meaning deep tail French).

During mitosis, microtubules grow from centrosomes which are located at opposite ends of the cell. Microtubules also attach to the centromere in special structures called kinetochores, one of which is present on each sister chromatid. Specific DNA base sequences in the kinetochore region, together with special proteins, allow for more durable attachment in this region. The microtubules then pull the chromatids toward the centrosomes, so that each daughter cell inherits one set of chromatids. After the cell divides, the chromatids are broken down again and the DNA can be transcribed again. Despite their appearance, chromosomes are structurally highly condensed, which allows these giant DNA structures to be contained within the cell nucleus. Chromosomes in humans can be divided into two types: autosomes (body chromosomes) and allosomes (sex chromosomes). Certain genetic traits are associated with a person's sex and are passed down through the sex chromosomes, while autosomes contain other genetic hereditary information. All chromosomes act in the same way during cell division. Human cells have 23 pairs of chromosomes (22 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes), for a total of 46 chromosomes in each cell.

The study of human karyotypes took years to answer the most basic question: How many chromosomes are contained in a normal diploid human cell? In 1912, Hans von Winiwarter reported 47 chromosomes in the spermatogonia and 48 in the oogonium thus deducing the XX/XO sex determination mechanism. Theophilus Painter in 1922 was unsure whether the male diploid number was 46 or 48; he was originally in favor of 46. He revised his opinion later from 46 to 48, and he insisted that humans have an XX/XY system. New techniques are needed to definitively solve the problem: (1) using cells in culture; (2) arresting mitosis in metaphase with colchicine solution; (3) pretreating the cells in a hypotonic solution of 0.075 M KCl, which swells and scatters the chromosomes; (4) pressing the preparation on the glass which forces the chromosomes into one plane; (5) cropping the photomicrograph and compiling the results into an indisputable cariogram.

In everyday usage, mass is usually synonymous with weight (eg for body weight instead of body mass). But according to modern scientific understanding, the weight of an object results from the interaction of the mass with the gravitational field. For example, a person lifting a heavy object on Earth might associate the object's weight with its mass. This association is acceptable for objects that are on Earth. However, if the object is on the Moon, the weight of the object will be smaller and easier to lift, but the mass will remain the same. The human body is equipped with senses that allow us to feel various phenomena associated with the masses. A person can observe an object to determine its size, lift it to feel its weight, and push it to feel its inertia. These senses are part of our understanding of mass, but none of them fully represent the abstract concept of mass. Abstract concepts do not come from sensing, but come from a combination of various human experiences. The modern concept of mass was introduced by Sir Isaac Newton (1642-1727) in his explanation of gravity and inertia. Previously, the various phenomena of gravity and inertia were seen as two different and unrelated things.

Standard time was established by making atomic clocks based on the vibrations of waves emitted by cesium atoms. The first atomic clock stored in the National Institute of Standards and Technology, United States. Within 30,000 years there will only be one mistake. Today atomic clocks are installed on every satellite of the global positioning system that orbits the earth from outer space. The tool used to measure mass is usually a scale. In SI units, mass is measured in kilograms, kg. There are also various other units of mass, for example: In normal situations, the weight of an object is proportional to its mass. But the difference between mass and weight is necessary for high-precision measurements. Because of the relativistic relationship between mass and energy, it is possible to use units of energy to represent mass.",

Physically, the genome can be divided into different nucleic acid molecules (as chromosomes or plasmids), while functionally, the genome can be divided into genes. The term genome was introduced by Hans Winkler from the University of Hamburg, Germany, in 1920, perhaps as a combination of the words gene and chromosome or meant to express a collection of genes. Every organism has a genome which contains the biological information needed to build its body and maintain its life and be passed on to the next generation. By a number of complex interactions, the nucleotide sequences of the components of a nucleic acid are used to make all the proteins in an organism at the right time and place. These proteins become the building blocks of organisms or have the ability to make these body building components or drive the metabolic reactions necessary for life. Most genomes, including those of humans and other living things with living cells, are made of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), but some viruses have an RNA (ribonucleic acid) genome. The study of the genome is known as genomics (genomics). Currently, the nucleotide sequences (sequences) in the genomes of a number of organisms have been completely mapped by DNA sequencing techniques in various genome projects, for example the Human Genome Project which was completed in 2003. Comparison of the genomes of organisms can provide information about the characteristics of these organisms, their evolution, and various processes biological. Double-stranded (ds) DNA is a component of the genomes of most organisms and all cells. However, RNA viruses have a ds or single-stranded (ss) RNA genome.

Meanwhile, the genome of eukaryotes (organisms with a cell nucleus, for example humans) is usually a number of \"linear dsDNA\" molecules. The term nuclear genome in eukaryotes refers to the genetic information in the form of chromosomes, and sometimes also \"extrachromosomal DNA fragments\", in the cell nucleus. The extranuclear genome of eukaryotic cells includes the mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes, which are \"circular dsDNA\" molecules (these are the same as those in prokaryotes). Most prokaryotes have only one chromosome. Therefore, prokaryotes generally contain one copy of each gene and are thus haploid. Meanwhile, eukaryotes generally have two copies of each gene and are genetically diploid. There are also organisms (for example, plants) that have more than two sets of chromosomes in the nucleus of each body cell, or are called polyploid. In general, there are differences in genome size, number of genes, and gene density between prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Prokaryotes have smaller genomes with fewer genes and greater gene density than eukaryotes. Bacteria and archaea generally have genomes about 1\u20136 million base pairs (Mb) in size containing 1,500\u20137,500 genes. For example, the genome of the bacterium Escherichia coli is 4.6 Mb in size and contains about 4,300 genes. In contrast, eukaryotes have larger genomes with more genes. The genome of the single-celled yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (classified as fungi), for example, is about 12 Mb in size, whereas most multicellular plants and animals have genomes of over 100 Mb. Meanwhile, the number of genes in the genome of eukaryotes can reach 5,000 in single-celled fungi up to 40,000 in multicellular creatures.",

In one cell, more than one plasmid can be found with varying sizes, but all plasmids do not encode functions that are important for cell growth. Generally, plasmids encode the genes needed to survive under unfavorable conditions so that when the environment returns to normal, the plasmid DNA can be discarded. The discovery of plasmids began in 1887, when Robert Koch published his research on the bacterium Bacillus anthracis as the cause of anthrax. About 100 years later, scientists discovered that the bacterium had two plasmids that are virulence factors that cause anthrax. The term plasmid was introduced in 1952 by American biologist Joshua Ledenberg to refer to \"hereditary determinants of heredity outside of chromosomes\". Joshua Lederberg and W. Hayes succeeded in investigating conjugation events in Escherichia coli involving plasmids. Early use of the term \"plasmid\" included any genetic material that existed extrachromosomally for at least part of the replication cycle, including viral genetic material. However, the plasmid idea refined over time to consist of autonomously reproducing genetic elements. Then in 1968, it was decided that the definition be narrowed down to genetic elements that exist exclusively or are dominant outside the chromosome and can be replicated independently. Not long after that, plasmids were proven to be extrachromosomal DNA that causes antibiotic resistance in enteric bacteria and can be transmitted between cells. Since then, several laboratories have started to make plasmids that can be transferred to living cells, such as bacterial and plant cells. Initially, the naming of plasmids was based on the phenotypic properties encoded by the plasmid's DNA.",

To standardize plasmid writing, the letter \"p\" is used followed by an initial capital letter and a number. Capital letters are taken from the name of the institution or laboratory where the plasmid originates or from the name of the plasmid's inventor. Meanwhile, the numbers are codes between the two laboratories where the plasmid was made. For example: pBR322, \"p\" denotes the plasmid, BR being the laboratory where the plasmid was first constructed (BR of Bolivar and Rodriguez, designers of the plasmid), while 322 represents the laboratory in which this plasmid was made, many other pBRs such as pBR325, pBR327, and etc. Most plasmids have a circular structure, but there are also linear plasmids which can be found in certain microorganisms, such as Borrelia burgdorferi and Streptomyces. Plasmids are found in the form of double-stranded DNA, most of which are arranged into supercoils or twisted coils. The supercoiled structure occurs because the topoisomerase enzyme makes some of the double-stranded DNA loose (unbound) during plasmid replication. The supercoiled structure will cause the plasmid DNA to be in a conformation called covalently closed circular (ccc), but if the two strands of DNA are released, the plasmid will return to its normal state (untwisted) and the conformation is referred to as open circular (oc). . In order for plasmids to replicate independently within the cell, they must possess a DNA sequence that can act as a replication origin (ori). The self-replicating unit, in this case the plasmid, is called a replicon. A typical bacterial replicon may consist of a number of elements such as the gene for a plasmid-specific replication initiation protein (Rep), repeating units called iterons, a DnaA box, and an adjacent AT-rich region.",

Certain types of plasmids can also insert into the host chromosome, and these integrative plasmids are sometimes referred to as episomes in prokaryotes. Currently, plasmids have been produced commercially by a number of companies for use as cloning vectors. In order to be used as a cloning vector, a plasmid must have several criteria, namely small size, relatively high copy number, and selection marker genes. and reporter genes, as well as having restriction enzyme cutting sites to facilitate DNA insertion into the plasmid vector. Another major use of plasmids is to make proteins in bulk. In this case, the researchers grew bacteria containing the plasmid harboring the gene of interest. Just as bacteria produce proteins to confer antibiotic resistance, bacteria can also be induced to produce large amounts of proteins from the inserted gene. It is a cheap and easy way to produce genetically encoded proteins, for example, insulin production. Plasmids can also be used for gene transfer into human cells as a potential treatment in gene therapy so that they can express the desired protein in the cell. Some gene therapy strategies require insertion of therapeutic genes at preselected target chromosomal sites in the human genome. Plasmid vectors are one of many approaches that can be used for this purpose. Zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) offer a way to cause site-specific double-strand breaks in genomic DNA and cause homologous recombination. ZFN-carrying plasmids can help deliver therapeutic genes to specific sites so that cell damage, cancer-causing mutations, or immune responses can be avoided.",

The limited efficiency of plasmid-based techniques precludes their use in the creation of more accurate human cell models. However, the development of Adeno-associated virus recombination techniques, and Zn finger nucleation, has enabled the creation of a new generation of isogenic human disease models. To prevent wasting plasmids from cells that no longer need them, several mechanisms are known. One is that some plasmids encode proteins that can kill cells that dispose of them. This mechanism is called plasmid addiction, which is classified into three types based on the action of the plasmid-encoded antitoxin protein. The three types of action are interacting with the toxin, protecting the target to be attacked by the toxin, and inhibiting the expression of the toxin. Plasmids are often used to purify certain sequences, because they can be easily purified from the rest of the genome. For use as vectors, and for molecular cloning, plasmids often need to be isolated. There are several methods for isolating plasmid DNA from bacteria, including miniprep (mini preparation) and maxiprep, bulkprep or largeprep. Miniprep can be used to quickly determine whether a plasmid is present in one of several clones of bacteria. The result is a small amount of impure plasmid DNA, which is sufficient for analysis with restriction enzymes and for some cloning techniques. Largeprep uses a much larger volume. A largeprep can be said to be an enhanced miniprep followed by additional purification. This method produces very large quantities (several hundred micrograms) of very pure plasmid DNA.

Viewed from the perspective of the history of philosophy, Plato is classified as an Ancient Greek philosopher. He is the author of philosophical dialogues and the founder of the Platonic Academy in Athens, the first high school in the western world. Plato is believed to be a philosopher who played a major role in the development of Ancient Greek philosophy and western philosophy in general. Plato's teacher, Socrates, and Plato's student, Aristotle, also made a great contribution. Apart from being a philosopher, Plato is also known as one of the founders of western religions and spirituality. Plato's thought was developed into Neoplatonism by thinkers such as Plotinus and Porphyry. Neoplantonism had a major influence on the development of Christianity, especially influencing the thinking of Church Fathers such as Augustine. The philosopher Alfred North Whitehead even credited Plato with saying, \"The safest general characterization of the European philosophical tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to Plato\". Plato's thinking was heavily influenced by Socrates. His most famous work is The Republic (in Greek \u03a0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 or Politeia, \"country\") in which he outlines his views on the \"ideal\" state. . citation needed] One of Plato's famous parables is the parable of the man in the cave. Cicero said Plato scribend est mortuus (Plato died while writing). In the works written in his youth, Plato always displays the personality and writings of Socrates as the main topics of his essays.

Modern people think that ideas are ideas or responses that exist in thought alone. Reference needed] According to Plato, ideas are not created by human thought. Idea is a world that transcends humans, so ideas do not depend on human thinking, but the human mind depends on the world of ideas. Ideas are the principal and prime images of reality, immaterial, eternal and unchanging. Ideas already exist and stand alone outside of our thinking. These ideas are related to one another. For example, the idea of \u200b\u200btwo paintings cannot be separated from the second idea, the second idea itself cannot be separated from the even idea. However, in the end there is a peak between the highest relation of ideas. This peak is called a \"beautiful\" idea. This idea goes beyond all existing ideas.

Ecological systems are formed from the unity and interaction between components that make up an ecosystem that are interconnected with one another. Ecological analysis is used by humans to create a sustainable living environment in an accountable way for security and sustainability, and well-being. Ecological principles are used in analyzing the human environment, population growth, increased food production, greening, erosion, flooding, preservation of germplasm and endangered animals, collection of rare fruits, and environmental pollution. Ecology is a science with a broad and complex topic, which includes hierarchy and biodiversity, number and distribution of organisms, roles and interactions between organisms, habitats and niches, food webs, nutrient and biogeochemical cycles, and various other processes. Various approaches can be used to classify ecology into a number of sub-disciplines, both according to spatial (place) and temporal (time) patterns, subjects studied, and links to other fields of science. There are no clear boundaries regarding the beginnings of ecology as a scientific discipline. Nonetheless, ecological principles have been studied since ancient Greece by Aristotle. Aristotle's student Theophrastus then observed and explained the relationship between organisms and their environment. He focused on the reasons certain species prefer certain environments.

It is partly organic, partly inorganic. Experts view the definition of ecology presented by Haeckel as part of physiology. Charles Krebs then separated ecology from the study of physiology. He explained that ecology is a science that examines the interactions of living things which explains the distribution and diversity of living things. In environmental interactions, ecology remains inseparable from physiology. Krebs' definition of ecology is then used as the core of ecological studies. George Evelyn Hutchinson (1903\u20131991) has been called the father of limnology and the father of modern ecology. He comprehensively observes and empirically measures organic and environmental factors that can affect the biota of a lake, and lays the foundations of ecological niches. Ecology then became popular around the 1960s when environmental issues started to get public attention. The development of ecological science and its relationship with other sciences occurred in 1968 and 1970 with the emergence of the environmental awareness movement. People are starting to think about the problems of pollution, nature conservation, population and food and energy consumption. Prior to the 1970s, ecology was still viewed as part of biology.

The environment refers to an organism, while the ecosystem cannot refer to a type of organism. The environment can be stated qualitatively, while the ecosystem can only be stated quantitatively. An ecological system is referred to as an ecosystem. The composition of the ecosystem is all organisms that function together in an area that interact with the physical environment. These interactions form the flow of energy that results in the well-defined structure of the biota and the cycle of matter between living and non-living parts. The same structure forms in many different ecosystems. All ecosystems have biotic and abiotic components. The biotic components can be grouped based on their trophic level. All ecosystems also have the same main function, which is to channel energy and form material cycles. Ecology studies the interactions between organisms and the interactions of organisms with abiotic components. This form of interaction is in the form of ways in which organisms adapt to take advantage of their environment. Living things require constant energy and matter to maintain their lives so that interactions always involve matter and energy. Organismal interactions occur within ecosystems that include predation, competition, and symbiotic relationships. Succession is the process of changing the composition of species within a landscape or ecosystem. Changes in composition occur due to disturbances in ecosystems or landscapes which are animal habitats. After the disturbance disappears or disappears, the animals try to return the habitat to its original state. The succession process can occur quickly or slowly. Succession that lasts for hundreds of years will reach a final stage that renders a community, ecosystem, or landscape irreversible.

The recovery process in primary succession is very difficult because the abiotic conditions have changed a lot. In secondary succession, recovery can occur rapidly. Locations that experienced secondary succession were in selective logging areas, locations of fallen trees, or shifting cultivation. Secondary succession does not improve completely because the disturbances that arise do not damage the entire environment. There are two components involved in the interaction between living things and their environment, namely living components (called biotic components or biotic factors) and non-living components (called abiotic components or abiotic factors). All types of living things with various roles are biotic components, including pathogens and parasites that cause disease. Abiotic components are the constituents of ecosystems in the form of non-living things, such as water, air, light, temperature, humidity, atmosphere, soil and acidity. In the marine environment, saltiness, oxygen levels, water clarity, and solar energy also include abiotic components that affect the organisms in them. The biological world can be grouped hierarchically according to the subject studied. Sequentially, the smallest to the largest units are cells, tissues, organs, organisms, species, populations, communities, ecosystems, biomes, and biosphere. Ecology can also be divided into several branches based on these groupings (above the level of individual organisms), for example population ecology, community ecology, and ecosystem ecology.

Biodiversity includes every level of biological organization, for example species diversity, ecosystem diversity and genetic diversity. Scientists are interested in how this diversity influences the complex ecological processes that operate at and between levels. Biodiversity plays an important role in the ecosystem services that maintain and enhance the quality of human life. Biodiversity (especially species diversity) and ecosystems influence each other. Environmental changes can result in loss of biodiversity so that stability needs to be maintained. Habitat is the type of natural environment occupied by a particular species to live. The habitat of a species is a place used by that species to find food, shelter, protection, and reproduce. Some types of habitats for example terrestrial habitats which include forests, grasslands, and deserts; freshwater habitats including rivers, lakes, and ponds; Marine habitats include bays, open sea, coral reefs, and the seabed. Organisms that experience habitat shifts are evidence of competition in nature. For example, one population of tropical lizards (Tropidurus hispidus) has a flatter body compared to their main population which lives in open savanna. Tropical lizard populations living in isolated rock outcrops can hide in rock crevices so their flattened bodies provide a selective advantage.

This definition was proposed by George Evelyn Hutchinson in 1957 although the concept of the ecological niche had been introduced since 1917 by Joseph Grinnell. If habitat is the specific location where an organism lives, niche is the role played by a species within an ecosystem. Niches describe the position of a species in a food web and its relationship with other species in an ecosystem. Along with changes in ecosystems, for example by engineering, niches can also change through a process called niche construction. This construction acts as a bridge connecting ecology, evolution, and ecosystem. Food webs are basic ecological networks. Plants capture solar energy and use it to synthesize simple sugars through photosynthesis. They collect nutrients and are then eaten by herbivores so that energy is transferred to the consuming organisms through consumption. A simple linear feeding path from basal trophic species to top consumers is called a food chain. Interrelated patterns of food chains in ecological communities create complex food webs. A food web is a concept map or heuristic tool used to describe and study the flow paths of energy and materials. Food web descriptions are often limited compared to the real world. Complete empirical measurements of food webs are generally limited to specific habitats, such as caves or ponds, and principles derived from food web studies are extrapolated to larger systems.

Links in food webs connect consumption relations or trophism between species. Biodiversity in ecosystems can be organized into trophic pyramids, with vertical dimensions representing feeding relationships from the bottom of the food chain to apex predators, and horizontal dimensions representing abundance or biomass at each level. Based on their role in the food web, species are categorized as autotrophs (or primary producers), heterotrophs (or consumers), and decomposers (also includes detritivores). Autotrophs are organisms that create their own food. They produce complex organic compounds (such as carbohydrates, fats, and proteins) by utilizing energy from light (photosynthesis) or inorganic chemical reactions (chemosynthesis). Heterotrophs are organisms that must eat other organisms to get energy. Heterotrophs can be further divided into several functional groups which include primary consumers (strictly herbivores), secondary consumers (carnivorous predators that exclusively eat herbivores), and tertiary consumers (predators that eat a mixture of herbivores and other predators). Omnivores do not fit into this functional category because they eat plant and animal tissues. Nonetheless, omnivores have greater functional influence as predators.

Elton conducted research with tradable animals and began to develop a number of concepts in naturalist terminology, including ecological niches, food chains, and pyramids of numbers. The pyramid of numbers deals with reducing the number of individual organisms, or the total weight of the organisms at each stage of the food chain. The school of animal ecology emerged in the early-mid 20th century AD in Europe and the United States. Soil animal ecology can be viewed from two types of science and the object of study.

Factors that affect the environment are plants, animals, microorganisms, and humans. The plant community is a group of plant groups that influence and depend on one another. Differences from each plant community are observed through the types of vegetation that provide significant changes in terms of space. Changes in space can be in the form of changes in the composition of plant species, changes in the distance between plants, and changes in plant size and changes in plant responses to the environment.

Rare animals found in the coastal forest are cockatoos, coconut parrots, and scorched birds. The coastal forest carries out succession through the scaffolding with the pescaprae formation and through the barringtonia with the barringtonia formation. Both types of formations are found on sandy beaches and rocky beaches. The growth and dispersal of plant seeds in coastal forests is assisted by sea water, wind or birds that resemble bats. Dispersal of seeds by seawater occurs in butun, ketapang, and nyamplung plants. Seed dispersal by birds occurs in ketapang, nyamplung, and beach cabbage. Meanwhile, wind-assisted seed dispersal occurs in heritiera species. Ecology in terms of the environment can be divided into plant ecology and animal ecology. The study of both types of ecology is related to species and communities. The ecological study of species is called autecology, while the study of communities is called synecology. Autecology only discusses the interaction between one type of organism and its physical environment without taking into account the presence of other organisms in the same habitat. While synecology discusses the interaction between an organism and other organisms. Ecology discusses basic studies in environmental science, namely species, populations, communities, ecosystems and habitats. The study of ecological balance is contained in the study of environmental preservation and the role of the environment as a source of life for the community. The link between environmental science and ecology is connected with the existence of local wisdom. Environmental science becomes part of applied ecology.",

Ovipar comes from the word ovum which means egg. Oviparous is a type of reproduction that causes the eggs that are released to develop and hatch outside the mother's body. Examples of oviparous animals include chickens, geese, birds, fish, frogs, insects. Birds are also oviparous animals. Even though birds do not have external genitals, fertilization still occurs inside the body. This is done by attaching the cloaca to each other. In female birds there is only one ovary, namely the left ovary. The right ovary does not grow completely and remains small which is called rudimentary. The ovary is attached by an ovum-receiving funnel which is continued by the oviduct. The end of the oviduct enlarges to become the uterus which opens into the cloaca. In male birds there are a pair of testicles that coincide with the ureters and open in the cloaca. Fertilization will take place at the end of the oviduct when the sperm enters the oviduct. The fertilized ovum will move toward the cloaca. On the way to the cloaca in the oviduct area, the ovum that has been fertilized by sperm will be surrounded by a shell material in the form of lime. Eggs can hatch when incubated by their parents. Ovipar is an embryo that develops inside the egg and is protected by a shell. The embryo gets food from the food reserves in the egg. The eggs are removed from the mother's body and then incubated until they hatch into children. Oviparity occurs in birds and some reptiles. There are two types of fertilization in oviparous animals, namely internal fertilization and external fertilization. Internal fertilization will occur in the body of the female parent, such as the process experienced by aves (birds) and insects (insects).",

It has a diameter of about 1,392,684 km, about 109 times the diameter of Earth, and its mass (about 2\u00d71030 kilograms, 330,000 times that of Earth) represents approximately 99.86 % of the total mass of the solar system. The sun is the largest celestial body in the Milky Way galaxy, which is even 10 times the size of the largest planet in the solar system, Jupiter. Chemically, about three-quarters of the sun's mass is composed of hydrogen, while the remainder is predominantly helium. The rest of the mass (1.69%, equivalent to 5,629 times the mass of Earth) consists of heavy elements such as oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron. The sun formed about 4.6 billion years ago due to the gravitational decay of a region within a large molecular cloud. Most of the matter gathered in the center, while the rest flattened out into the circulating disk that would become the solar system. Its central mass gets hotter and denser and eventually starts thermonuclear fusion in its core. It is thought that nearly all other stars formed by a similar process. The classification of sun stars, based on their spectral class, is a main sequence G star (G2V) and is often classified as a yellow dwarf because its radiation appears to be more intense in the yellow-red portion of the spectrum. Although the color is white, from the surface of the Earth, the sun looks yellow due to the mixing of blue light in the atmosphere. According to the spectrum class label, G2 indicates a surface temperature of around 5778 K (5505 \u00b0C) and V indicates that the sun, like other stars, is a sequence star. main, so its energy is created by the nuclear fusion of hydrogen nuclei into helium. At its core, the sun fuses 620 million metric tons of hydrogen every second.

However, as the star closest to Earth, the sun is the brightest object in the sky with an apparent magnitude of \u221226.74. The sun's hot corona continues to expand in space and creates the solar wind, which is a stream of charged particles that travels up to the heliopause at about 100 au. The bubble in the interstellar medium formed by the solar wind, the heliosphere, is the largest continuous structure in the solar system. The Sun is currently moving through the Local Interstellar Cloud (near the G Cloud) in the Local Bubble zone, within the innermost rim of the Orion Arm of the Milky Way galaxy. Of the 50 closest star systems within 17 light years of Earth (the closest star is a red dwarf named Proxima Centauri about 4.2 light years away), the sun has the fourth largest mass. The sun orbits the center of the Milky Way at a distance of approximately 24,000\u201326,000 light years from the galactic center. When viewed from the galactic north pole, the sun completes one orbit clockwise in about 225\u2013250 million years. Since the Milky Way is moving relative to the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation towards the constellation Hydra at a speed of 550 km/s, the sun's speed relative to the CMB is about 370 km/s in the direction of Crater or Leo. The sun's average distance from Earth is about 149.6 million kilometers (1 au), although this distance varies as the Earth moves from perihelion in January to aphelion in July.

This sunlight energy helps the development of Hydrothermal Rifts (biological community) almost all life forms on Earth through photosynthesis and changes the Earth's climate and weather. The extraordinary impact of the sun on the Earth has been observed since prehistoric times. The sun was also considered by a number of civilizations as a god. Accurate scientific understanding of the sun developed slowly. In the 19th century, several prominent scientists began to know a little about the physical composition and energy sources of the sun. This understanding is still developing today. There are a number of anomalies in the behavior of the sun that cannot be explained scientifically. The sun is a G-type main sequence star which comprises approximately 99.85% of the total mass of the solar system. Its shape is almost perfectly spherical with an obstinacy of nine millionths, meaning that the polar diameter differs by only 10 km from the equator. Because the sun is made of plasma and not a solid, it rotates faster at the equator than at the poles. This event is called differential rotation and occurs due to convection in the sun and its mass movement due to temperature gradations that are too far from the core to the surface. The mass pushes some of the sun's angular momentum counterclockwise as viewed from the north ecliptic pole so that its angular velocity is redistributed. The actual rotational period is estimated to be 25.6 days at the equator and 33.5 days at the poles. However, due to the changing vantage point from Earth as it orbits the sun, the rotation appears at the equator in approximately 28 days. This slow rotation centrifugal effect is 18 million times weaker than surface gravity at the sun's equator. The effect of planetary tides is even weaker and has little effect on the shape of the sun.",

This theory is based on the abundance of heavy elements in the solar system, such as gold and uranium, compared to population II stars which have few heavy elements. These elements are most likely produced by endothermic nuclear reactions during supernovae or transmutation via absorption of neutrons within a second-generation giant star. The sun does not have a definite boundary like the rocky planets. The density of the gas in its outermost parts decreases with increasing distance from the center of the sun. Even so, the sun has a clear interior structure. The sun's radius is measured from its center to the edge of the photosphere. The photosphere is the last layer that is visible because the layers above it are either too cold or too thin to radiate enough light to be visible to the naked eye in the face of the bright light from the photosphere. During a total solar eclipse, when the photosphere is blocked by the Moon, the solar corona is visible around it. The sun's interior cannot be seen directly and the sun itself is impenetrable to electromagnetic radiation. Following seismology which uses earthquake waves to reveal the Earth's inner structure, the discipline of helioseismology uses pressure waves (infrasound) traveling through the sun's interior to measure and map the sun's inner structure. The solar computer model is also used as a theoretical tool to investigate its deepest layers. The sun's core is estimated to extend from its center to 20\u201325% of the sun's radius.

Only 0.8% of the sun's energy comes from the CNO cycle. The core is the only region of the sun that generates sufficient thermal energy through fusion; 99% of its energy is generated within 24% of the sun's radius. Fusion almost stops completely at 30% radius. The remainder is heated by energy transferred outward by radiation from the core to the convective zone beyond. The energy produced by fusion in the core must traverse several layers on its way to the photosphere before escaping into space in the form of sunlight or the kinetic energy of particles. The proton\u2013proton chain occurs about 9.2\u00d71037 times per second in the nucleus. Because it uses four free protons (hydrogen nuclei), this reaction converts approximately 3.7\u00d71038 protons into alpha particles (helium nuclei) every second (out of a total of ~8.9\u00d71056 free protons in the sun) or about 6.2 \u00d71011 kg per second. Because fusing hydrogen into helium releases approximately 0.7% of its fused mass in the form of energy, the sun releases energy at a mass\u2013energy conversion rate of 4.26 million metric tons per second, 384.6 yotta watts (3.846\u00d71026 W), or 9.192\u00d71010 megatons of TNT per second. This mass is not destroyed to create energy, but is converted into energy equivalents and transported in radiated energy, as explained by the concept of mass\u2013energy equivalence. The power production by fusion in the core varies with the distance from the center of the sun. At the center of the sun, theoretical models estimate the magnitude to be 276.5 watts/m3, an energy production density that is roughly closer to that of a reptile metabolism than a thermonuclear bomb. b] The peak power production in the sun has been compared to the volumetric heat generated in an active compost heap. .",

        "paragraph": "The extraordinary power output of the sun is due not to its high power per volume, but to its large size. The fusion rate in the core is in a self-sustaining equilibrium. The slightly higher fusion rate causes the core to heat up and expand slightly against the weight of its outer layers, thereby reducing the fusion rate and improving perturbation; the somewhat lower level resulted in the core cooling down and shrinking slightly thereby increasing the fusion rate and fixing it to its current level. The gamma rays (high energy photons) released in fusion reactions are only absorbed by a few millimeters of solar plasma, then are re-emitted randomly in a lower energy form. Therefore, it takes a long time for radiation to reach the sun's surface. Estimates of the photon's travel time range from 10\u2013170 thousand years. Neutrinos, which represent about 2% of the sun's total energy production, take just 2.3 seconds to reach the surface. Since energy transport in the sun is a process that involves photons in thermodynamic equilibrium with matter, the time scale for energy transport in the sun is longer, spanning 30 million years. This is the time it takes for the sun to return to a steady state if the rate of energy creation in its core suddenly changes. During the latter part of a photon's outgoing journey, in the outer convective zone, there are fewer collisions and lower energy. The photosphere is the transparent surface of the sun where photons are released in the form of visible light. Every gamma ray in the sun's core is converted into several million photons of visible light before escaping into space. Neutrinos are also released by fusion reactions in the nucleus, but not like photons. Neutrinos rarely interact with matter to the point that everything can easily escape from the sun.",

At approximately 0.7 solar radii, the solar material is hot and dense enough that thermal radiation is the primary means of transferring energy from the core. This zone is not governed by thermal convection. However, the temperature drops from about 7 million to 2 million kelvin as the distance from the core increases. This temperature gradient is less than the adiabatic interval level value so it cannot create convection. Energy is transferred by the radiation of hydrogen and helium ions which emit photons, which travel only slightly before being reabsorbed by other ions. Its density drops a hundredfold (from 20 g/cm3 to 0.2 g/cm3) from 0.25 solar radius above the radiation zone. The radiative zone and the convective zone are separated by a transition layer, the tacocline. This is a region where the marked change in phenomenon between uniform rotation in the radiative zone and differential rotation in the convective zone results in large gaps\u2014a condition when horizontal layers rub against each other in opposite directions. The liquid motion found in the convective zone above slowly dissipates from above to below this layer, much like the calm characteristic of the radiative zone below. Currently, it is thought that a magnetic dynamo within this layer creates the sun's magnetic field (read solar dynamo).

        "paragraph": "As a result, radiative heat transport is less effective. The density of these gases is too low to allow convective currents to form. Material heated in the tacocline heats up and expands, reducing its density and allowing it to rise. In effect, thermal convection develops as the hot cells transport the majority of the heat out into the sun's photosphere. As the material cools in the photosphere, it increases in density, then sinks to the bottom of the convection zone. There, the material harnesses heat from above the radiative zone and this cycle continues. In the photosphere, the temperature drops to 5,700 K and the density drops to 0.2 g/m3 (about 1/6,000 the density of air at sea level). Hot columns in the convective zone form traces on the sun's surface called granulations and supergranulations. This turbulent convection in the outermost parts of the sun's interior creates a \"small-scale\" dynamo that creates north and south magnetic poles across the sun's surface. The solar hot column is called a B\u00e9nard cell and has the shape of a hexagonal prism. The sun's visible surface, the photosphere, is the layer beneath which it becomes opaque to visible light. Above the photosphere, sunlight seems to be free to travel into space and its energy is completely released from the sun. The change in opacity is caused by a decrease in the number of H\u2212 ions which easily absorb visible light. In contrast, the visible light we see is produced in the form of electrons and reacts with hydrogen atoms to produce H\u2212 ions. The photosphere is tens to hundreds of kilometers thick, slightly less opaque than the air on Earth. Because the top of the photosphere is cooler than the bottom, the sun's image appears brighter in the center than the edges or arms of the sun's disk; this phenomenon is called darkening of the arms. The spectrum of sunlight is roughly the same as that of a black body with radiation of about 6,000 K, intermingling with the atomic absorption paths of the thin layer above the photosphere.",

During early studies of the optical spectrum of the photosphere, several absorption paths were discovered that were not associated with any known chemical elements on Earth at that time. In 1868, Norman Lockyer hypothesized that these absorption pathways were formed by a new element which he called helium, after the Greek sun god Helios. Twenty-five years later, helium has been successfully isolated on Earth. The part of the sun above the photosphere is called the solar atmosphere. The atmosphere can be observed with telescopes that operate across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, from radio to visible light to gamma rays, and is composed of five main zones: low temperature, chromosphere, transition region, corona, and heliosphere. The heliosphere, considered the thin outer atmosphere of the sun, extends outward past Pluto's orbit to the heliopause which forms the boundary with the interstellar medium. The chromosphere, transition region, and corona are much hotter than the sun's surface. The reasons have not been proven correct; available evidence suggests that Alfv\u00e9n waves have enough energy to heat the corona. The sun's coldest layer is a low temperature region located about 500 km above the photosphere with a temperature of approximately 4,100 K. This part of the sun is cool enough to allow the presence of simple molecules such as carbon monoxide and water, which can be detected by their absorption spectra. Above the low temperature layer, there is a 2,000 km thick layer which is dominated by the emission and absorption spectra.

This increase in temperature is aided by the complete ionization of helium in the transition region, which greatly reduces the radiative cooling of the plasma. The transition region is not formed at a fixed altitude. This region forms a kind of nimbus around chromosphere features such as spicules and filaments and is in constant irregular motion. The transition region is difficult to observe from the Earth's surface, but can be observed from space using instruments sensitive to the extreme ultraviolet spectrum. The corona is an extension of the sun's outer atmosphere that is larger in volume than the sun itself.

Both Voyager probes have recorded high concentrations of energetic particles as they approach the boundary. The sun is an active magnetic star. The sun has a strong magnetic field that varies annually and reverses direction every eleven years around the solar maximum. The sun's magnetic field causes a number of effects that are collectively known as solar activity, including sunspots on the sun's surface, solar flares, and variations in the solar wind that transport material across the solar system. The impact of solar activity on Earth includes auroras at mid to high latitudes as well as radio communication and electrical power disturbances. Solar activity is thought to have played a large role in the formation and evolution of the solar system. Solar activity changes the structure of Earth's outer atmosphere. All matter in the sun is in the form of gas and high temperature called plasma. This allows the sun to rotate faster at the equator (about 25 days) than at higher latitudes (about 35 days near the poles). The differential rotation of the sun's latitude causes its magnetic field paths to bind together over time, producing magnetic field circles from the sun's surface and triggering the formation of sunspots and sun prominences (read magnetic reconnection). This binding action creates a solar dynamo and an 11-year cycle of magnetic activity; The sun's magnetic field reverses every 11 years. The sun's magnetic field stretches far past the sun itself.

Because the fields above and below the sun's equator have different polarities toward and away from the sun, there is one thin sheet of currents in the plane of the sun's equator called the heliospheric current sheet. At greater distances, the sun's rotation twists the magnetic field and current sheets into an Archimedes spiral-like structure called a Parker spiral. The interplanetary magnetic field is stronger than the dipole component of the sun's magnetic field. The solar dipole magnetic field of 50\u2013400 \u03bcT (in the photosphere) decreases with distance to about 0.1 nT at Earth distances. Even so, according to spacecraft observations, the interplanetary field at Earth's location is about 5 nT, more or less a hundred times larger. This difference is due to the magnetic field created by electric currents in the plasma that surrounds the sun.

The Prominence can only be seen from Earth with the help of telescopes and filters. The largest prominence ever captured by SOHO (Solar and Heliospheric Observatory) is estimated to be 350 thousand km long. Like the corona, the prominence is formed from plasma, but has a cooler temperature. The prominences contain material with a mass of up to 100 billion kg. The prominence occurs in the sun's photosphere and moves outwards towards the solar corona. The plasma prominence moves along the sun's magnetic field. Eruption can occur when the prominesa structure becomes unstable so that it will break and release its plasma. When an eruption occurs, the ejected material becomes part of a very large magnetic structure called a coronal mass ejection (CME). The movement of the corona bursts occurs at a very high speed, which is between 20 thousand m/s to 3.2 million km/s. The movement also causes the temperature to increase by tens of millions of degrees in a short time. If a coronal mass ejection erupts toward Earth, it will interact with Earth's magnetic field and cause a geomagnetic storm that has the potential to disrupt communication and electricity networks. A stable prominence can persist in the corona for months and continues to increase in size each day. Experts are still researching how and why prominence occurs.

The temperature in the umbra is around 2,200\u00b0C while in the penumbra it is 3,500\u00b0C. Because light emission is also affected by temperature, the umbra sunspots emit only 1/6 times the light compared to the sun's surface of the same size. The solar wind is formed from a constant stream of particles ejected by the upper atmosphere of the sun that travels throughout the solar system. These particles have high energy. However, the process of moving out of the sun's gravitational field at such high speeds is not completely understood. The speed of the solar wind is divided into two, namely fast winds reaching 400 km/s and fast winds reaching more than 500 km/s. This speed also increases exponentially with distance from the sun. The common solar wind has a speed of 750 km/s and originates from the coronal hole in the sun's atmosphere. Some evidence of the existence of the solar wind that can be felt or seen from Earth is high-energy geomagnetic storms that damage satellites and power systems, auroras at the North Pole or South Pole, and particles resembling the long tails of comets that are always away from the sun due to the blowing of the solar wind. The solar wind can harm life on Earth if there is no Earth's magnetic field to protect it from radiation.

        "paragraph": "Antibodies (abbreviated Ab), also known as immunoglobulins (abbreviated as Ig), are large Y-shaped proteins used by the immune system to identify and neutralize foreign bodies such as pathogenic bacteria and viruses. Antibodies recognize unique molecules belonging to the pathogen, which are called antigens. Each \"Y\" end of the antibody contains a paratope (analogous to a lock) that is specific for a particular epitope (analogous to a lock) on the antigen, allowing these two structures to bind precisely. Using this binding mechanism, antibodies can mark infected microorganisms or cells for attack by other components of the immune system or can neutralize them directly (eg by blocking parts of the virus that are essential for invasion). In order to enable the immune system to recognize millions of different antigens, the antigen binding sites at the two ends of the antibody also have an equal number of variations. Meanwhile, the rest of the antibody remained relatively constant. Antibodies have several variants that determine the class or isotype of the antibody, namely IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, or IgM. In the relatively constant antibody stem, there are sites involved in interactions with other components of the immune system. Therefore, the class division determines the function triggered by the antibody after binding to the antigen, in addition to differences in structural characteristics. Different classes of antibodies also affect differences in where they are released in the body and at what stage of the immune response. Along with B cells and T cells, antibodies are an important part of the adaptive immune system. They exist in two forms: attached to B cells or dissolved in extracellular fluids such as blood plasma. Initially, antibodies attach to the surface of B cells \u2013 they are referred to as B cell receptors (BCR). After antigen binds to the BCR, B cells are activated to proliferate and differentiate into plasma cells (which secrete soluble antibodies with the same paratopes) or into memory B cells (which persist in the body to activate long-term immunity against the antigen. ).",

Y-shaped units can stand alone as monomers or be assembled in molecular complexes of two to five units. Antibodies are glycoproteins that belong to the immunoglobulin superfamily. The terms antibody and immunoglobulin are often used interchangeably, although the term 'antibody' is sometimes used for a form that is secreted and soluble, in other words, excluding B cell receptors. binds to it, stimulates destruction of pathogens by coating them with macrophages and other cells; and promotes pathogen damage by stimulating other immune responses such as the complement pathway. Antibodies are heavy proteins (~150 kDa) about 10 nm in size. The molecule is arranged in three globular regions roughly forming the letter Y. In humans and most mammals, an antibody unit consists of four polypeptide chains, namely two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains; they are linked by disulfide bonds. Each chain is a series of domains: somewhat similar sequences of about 110 amino acids each. These domains are usually represented in simplified schematics as rectangles. The light chain consists of one VL variable domain and one CL constant domain, while the heavy chain contains one VH variable domain and three to four CH1, CH2 constant domains, and so on. Structurally, the antibody is also divided into two antigen-binding fragments (Fab), each of which contains one VL, VH, CL, and CH1 domain, and a crystallizable fragment (Fc), which forms part of the Y stem.",

Antibodies have various variations known as isotypes or classes. In placental mammals, there are five classes of antibodies known as IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, which are further divided into subclasses such as IgA1, IgA2. The prefix \"Ig\" stands for immunoglobulin, while the suffix indicates the type of heavy chain that the antibody contains: the type of heavy chain \u03b1 (alpha), \u03b3 (gamma), \u03b4 (delta), \u03b5 (epsilon), and \u03bc (mu) which is the basis labels for IgA, IgG, IgD, IgE, and IgM. The characteristics of each class are determined by the part of the heavy chain in the hinge and the Fc region. Each class has differences in biological properties, functional locations, and ability to handle antigens, as illustrated in the table. For example, IgE antibodies are responsible for allergic responses that include the release of histamine from mast cells, which contributes to asthma. The variable region of the antibody binds to allergy-causing antigens, such as house dust mite particles, while its Fc region (in the \u03b5 heavy chain) binds to Fc \u03b5 receptors on mast cells, triggering their degranulation (release of molecules stored in their granules). The antibody isotypes of B lymphocytes change during development and activation of these cells. Immature B cells, which are never exposed to antigens, express only IgM isotypes in a bound form on the cell surface. In this ready-to-respond form, B lymphocytes are known as \"naive B lymphocytes\". Naive B lymphocytes express IgM and IgD on their surface.

In this activated form, B cells start to produce antibodies in a secreted form instead of in a membrane-bound form. Some daughter cells of activated B cells undergo isotype switching, a mechanism that causes antibody production to change from IgM or IgD to other isotypes of antibodies, IgE, IgA, or IgG, that have specific roles in the immune system. Diagnosis of disease In the late 19th century, scientists studying infectious diseases developed new diagnostic techniques and treatments. New tools emerge from the growing understanding of the immune system and the role of the antitoxins (antibodies) that the body produces in response to invading organisms or toxins (antigens). Scientists design tests to detect the presence of antibodies in the blood and use the antigens to trigger an immune response. This test provides information about the patient's medical history, including current infections and exposure to previous illnesses. Testing can uncover infection before outward symptoms appear and help identify carriers of the disease or asymptomatic individuals who are exposed to a disease. Disease therapy Behring and Kitasato discovered passive antibody therapy that can protect against bacterial toxins. In the early 1890's and 1930's serum therapy was used widely to treat various infectious diseases. However, the popularity of serum antibody therapy occurred at about the same time that the first antibiotics were being developed, and antibiotics became more widely available, so the use of serum therapy declined. By the late 1940s it had been largely abandoned. While immunoglobulin preparations are available to treat some infections, such as hepatitis B, rabies and varicella-zoster virus, only one monoclonal antibody (palivizumab) has been licensed to prevent infectious diseases.",

Systematic studies include discovery, documentation, analysis, cultural values, norms, customs, customary law and interpretation of data in the form of artifacts (material culture, such as stone axes and temple buildings) and ecofacts (environmental objects, such as rocks, features of the earth's surface, and fossils) or features (artifacts) that cannot be separated from their place (archaeological sites). A typical research technique is archaeological excavations, although survey techniques are still being carried out. Archaeologists are a term for scholars, practitioners, or experts in the field of archeology. Archeology is diverse and becomes a long-standing debate. Among them is the so-called archaeological paradigm, namely compiling cultural history, understanding human behavior, and understanding the process of cultural change. Because it aims to understand human culture, this science is included in the humanities science group. Thus, there are various auxiliary sciences used, including history, anthropology, geology (with n the science of earth-forming layers which are a reference for the relative age of an archaeological find), geography, architecture, paleoanthropology and bioanthropology, physics (among others with carbon c-14 to obtain absolute dating), metallurgy (to obtain the elements of a metal object ), as well as philology (studying old manuscripts). Archeology today encompasses many related fields. For example, the discovery of a buried corpse will attract the interest of experts from various fields to study about the clothing and types of materials used, the shape of the ceramics and the way they were distributed, beliefs through what was buried with the corpse, chemists who are able to determine the age of excavations through such methods of measurement. carbon 14.",

In its development, archeology can also study contemporary culture, as popularized in the study of modern material culture (modern material culture). Because it relies on objects from the past, archeology really needs the preservation of these objects as a source of data. Therefore, another discipline was developed, namely management of archaeological resources (Archaeological Resources Management), or more broadly, management of cultural resources (CRM, Culture Resources Management). Purbawanism is a combination of the word 'purbawan' and the English suffix '-ism'. According to the Dictionary of the Language and Library Council, a purveyor has the intention of being a person who studies, collects and sells antiques, while '-ism' means character and behavior. It can be concluded that 'ancientism' refers to the attitudes and behavior of people who study, collect and sell antiquities. The more popular term used in English is antiquity or antiquarianism. The term first appeared in the 15th century as a historical branch of Renaissance Humanism. The first ancient activities of antiquity were carried out by Nabonidus (555\u2013538 BC), the last king of Babylon before being conquered by Cyrus the Great. He was very interested in the history of the Babylonian civilization and had discovered the Naram-Sin temple which was built 2200 years before his reign. During the reign of Julius Caesar, artifacts such as jars, ancient weapons and bronze were some of the findings of Roman troops when searching ancient graves in their colonies such as Greece and Italy.

Alexander VI, on the other hand, began exploring to increase the size of his collection. It had made activity a culture among the rich, clergy and churchmen and it marked the Age of Reformation or 'Dilettanti' (joy in Italian). Prehistoric Archeology developed in Europe and the United States. The field of archeology today is more focused on describing and reconstructing past lives and looking at culture normatively. This is also reinforced by the existence of many theories that can be used in the field. In short, the current history of archaeological development is more about the construction and strengthening of research methods as a result of theories collected from various branches. This shows that archeology is a multidisciplinary field. From the geology discipline, the idea of \u200b\u200bsoil layers was pioneered by James Hutton while the Theory of Uniformity by Charles Lyell is used to study the development of human archeology.

However, Jacques Boucher de Perthes in 1841 previously advocated the idea that human archeology is much earlier than 6004 years. He was also one of the figures who argued that historical archeology could be mapped according to geological periods. As a result, stratigraphic studies were further developed by William Smith at Kents Cavern, England. Charles Darwin's Theory of Evolution was originally coined from the aim of wanting to study human antiquity. His theory is based on the process of human evolution from primitive primate species to modern humans and published in 1871, The Descent of Man, which is still impressed in the study of human origins. His ideas also led to studies of human archeology based on cultural remains. During this time, old archeology contributed a lot to the development of this field. Among them are techniques for understanding hieroglyphics from the study of the Rosetta Stone by Jean-Francois Champollion, the discovery of a large Assyrian statue and cuneiform library at Kuyunjik by Paul Emile Botta, Austen Henry Layard and Henry Rawlinson, the discovery and study of remnants of Mayan culture in Yucatan, Mexico by John Lloyd Stephen, excavation of the Awamoa site in New Zealand by Walter Mantell in 1852 and most importantly, systematic excavation techniques by General August Lane-Fox Pitt-Rivers at Wor Barrow, Cranborne Chase in southern England.

The morphoarrangement discusses the relationship between the landform and its constituent elements. The relationship between geomorphology and the environment is studied in the morphoarrangement. The formation elements discussed include rock and water content in the land, land structure, land vegetation and land use. Destructional landscapes are also known as exogenic landscapes. The formation of destructive landscapes is driven by exogenous forces. Exogenous forces are forces that result from the influence of forces from solar energy and gravity. Types of exogenous forces include weathering, erosion, mass wasting and sedimentation. Constructional landscapes are also known as endogenic landforms. The formation of destructive landscapes is controlled by ecdogenous forces. Endogenous forces include all types of forces originating from the Earth. In general, endogenous forces include tectonic activity, magmatic activity and volcanic activity. Tectonic activity is caused by plate shifts and the formation of mountains. Magmatic activity includes all magma intrusions that reach the Earth's surface or are near the Earth's surface. While volcanic activity includes the formation of volcanoes and volcanic eruptions. The main forming processes responsible for the formation of topography are wind, waves, weather, soil movement, water flow, glaciers, tectonics, and volcanism.

Also sometimes they have an almost smooth long profile. This formation is called Rundkarren. Another type, the Rillenkarren, has a sharp channel, the ridge ends bounded by a series of V-shaped channels.

        "paragraph": "In chemistry, a solution is a homogeneous mixture of two or more substances. The substance that is present in a smaller amount in a solution is called the solute or the solute, while the substance that is present in a greater amount than the other substances in the solution is called the solvent or solvent. The composition of the solute and solvent in a solution is expressed in terms of the concentration of the solution, while the process of mixing the solute and solvent to form a solution is called dissolution or solvation. A common example of a solution is a solid dissolved in a liquid, such as salt or sugar dissolved in water. Gases can also be dissolved in liquids, for example carbon dioxide or oxygen in water. In addition, liquids can also dissolve in other liquids, while gases dissolve in other gases. There are also solid solutions, for example alloys (mixtures of metals) and certain minerals. The concentration of a solution expresses quantitatively the composition of the solute and solvent in the solution. Concentration is generally expressed in the ratio of the amount of solute to the total amount of substance in solution, or in the ratio of the amount of solute to the amount of solvent. Examples of some concentration units are molar, molal, and parts per million (ppm). Meanwhile, qualitatively, the composition of the solution can be expressed as dilute (low concentration) or concentrated (high concentration). The molecules of the components of the solution interact directly in a mixed state. In the dissolution process, the attraction between the particles of pure components is broken and replaced by the attraction between the solvent and the solute. Especially if the solvent and solute are both polar, a solvent structure will form around the solute; this allows the interaction between the solute and the solvent to remain stable. If the solute component is added continuously to the solvent, at some point the added component will no longer be able to dissolve.",

The amount of solute in the solution is maximum, and the solution is called a saturated solution. The point at which a solution is saturated is strongly influenced by various environmental factors, such as temperature, pressure, and contamination. In general, the solubility of a substance (ie the amount of a substance that can be dissolved in a particular solvent) is proportional to temperature. This is especially true for solids, although there are exceptions. The solubility of liquids in other liquids is generally less sensitive to temperature than the solubility of solids or gases in liquids. The solubility of gases in water is generally inversely related to temperature. If the intermolecular interactions of the components of the solution are as great as the intermolecular interactions of these components in the pure state, an idealization is formed which is called an ideal solution. An ideal solution obeys Raoult's law, namely that the vapor pressure of the solvent (liquid) is directly proportional to the mole fraction of the solvent in the solution. Absolutely ideal solutions do not exist in nature, but some solutions obey Raoult's law to some extent. An example of a solution that can be considered ideal is a mixture of benzene and toluene. Another feature of an ideal solution is that its volume is the exact sum of the volumes of its components. In non-ideal solutions, the sum of the volumes of pure solute and pure solvent is not equal to the volume of the solution. Aqueous liquid solutions exhibit properties that depend on the collective effect of the number of dissolved particles, called colligative properties (from the Latin colligare, \"clumping together\"). Colligative properties include vapor pressure lowering, boiling point elevation, freezing point depression, and osmotic pressure symptoms. Solutions can be classified for example based on the solute phase and the solvent.",

        "paragraph": "Steel is an iron-based alloy metal. Pure iron has properties that are less strong and easily corroded, but has a high level of ductility. The ferrous metal in steel is combined with several other elements, including carbon to modify its characteristics. Some common metals used as alloys are Nickel, Manganese, Aluminum, and Bismuth. Other elements that are used less frequently include Titanium, Vanadium, Chromium, Tungsten, Molybdenum, Boron, and Niobium. The ratio of steel constituents will affect the properties and characteristics of the steel itself. Elemental Carbon (C) is usually added to steel to increase its strength. Carbon in steel causes the strength of steel to increase but carbon also causes the elasticity of steel to decrease. The elemental carbon content of steel ranges from 0.2% to 2.1% by weight. Too much percentage of carbon will cause the steel to become brittle or break easily. Iron can be formed into two crystal forms, namely Body Center Cubic (BCC) and Face Center Cubic (FCC), depending on the temperature at which it is forged. In the BCC arrangement, there is an iron atom in the center of the atomic cube, and the FCC arrangement has iron atoms on each side of the six-sided cube of atoms. The allotropic interaction that occurs between ferrous metals and alloying elements, such as carbon, is what gives steel and cast iron their own characteristics. Although steel had previously been produced by blacksmiths using kilns for thousands of years, its use grew when more efficient production methods were discovered in the 17th century. With the invention of the Bessemer process in the mid-19th century, steel became a mass-produced material which made it cheaper to produce. Today, steel is one of the most common materials in the world, with the production of more than 1.3 billion tons annually replacing wrought iron.",

The steel industry is a vital element in industrialization. Without a good steel industry, industrialization will not work. The importance of the steel industry considering the use of steel in the construction of infrastructure, machine components, and transportation. The steel industry is able to absorb a lot of manpower, besides that the steel industry requires high technology supported by a skilled workforce. In its history, the Soviet Union made the steel industry a priority in the Soviet Industrialization in 1929 - 1941. According to statistics, China and India are the 2 largest steel producing countries. The English word Steel, namely steel, comes from the Proto-Germanic adverb, namely stahlija or stakhlijan (made of steel), which is related to stahlaz or stahlija (standing straight). As already reviewed, the carbon content in the steel alloy is between 0.002% and 2.14% by weight of the iron\u2013carbon alloy. This amount can vary depending on the alloying elements present in the alloy such as manganese, chromium, nickel, iron, tungsten, carbon, and so on. Basically, steel is an iron-carbon alloy that does not undergo eutectic reactions. On the contrary, cast iron undergoes this reaction. If the carbon content in the steel is too little, then the pure iron in the alloy will become ductile, soft, and weak. The higher carbon content than normal steel will create an alloy which is often called pig iron. Although iron that is successfully alloyed with carbon is called carbon steel, alloy steel is steel that is alloyed with other elements in order to impart certain characteristics to the steel.",

Other elements important in steelmaking: phosphorus, sulfur, silicon, and the presence of small amounts of oxygen, nitrogen, and copper, which normally should not be present in steel. An iron-carbon-only alloy with no other elements with a carbon content of 2.1% is commonly called cast iron. With modern steelmaking techniques such as metal powder forming, this process can produce steel and other materials with very high carbon content. Cast iron is not easy to soften even when heated, but can be formed by the casting process because it has a low melting point and has good properties of ease of casting. Some compositions of cast iron, although still more economical in melting and casting, may be heat treated after casting to produce articles with the characteristics of malleable iron or ductile iron. Steel differs from (now ancient) wrought iron, in that it contains little carbon but a great deal of slag. Iron can be found in parts of the Earth's crust only in ore form, usually in the form of iron oxides such as magnetite and hematite. iron is extracted from iron ore by removing the oxygen atoms and then recombining them with other atoms such as carbon. This process, called smelting, was first used on metals with a lower melting point than iron such as tin, which melted at 250\u00b0C (482\u00b0F), and copper, which melted at 1,100\u00b0C (2,010\u00b0F), later a combination of tin and copper is bronze, whose melting point is lower than 1,083\u00b0C (1,981\u00b0F) .

Because the oxidation state of iron increases very rapidly above 800\u00b0C (1,470\u00b0F), care must be taken that the smelting process must be carried out in an environment with low oxygen levels. The smelting process will produce an alloy called steel. Excess carbon and other impurities can be removed by several step processes. Several other materials are also added to the iron/carbon mixture to obtain steel with the desired characteristics. Nickel and manganese are added to increase strength, chromium is added to increase the hardness and boiling point, and the addition of vanadium also increases hardness and reduces the impact of metal fatigue. To prevent corrosion, at least 11% wt of chromium must be added to form a hard oxide on the steel surface; This steel is known as stainless steel (tarnish-resistant steel). Tungsten is added to the formation of cementite, so that at a lower watering rate it will form martensite. On the other hand, sulfur, nitrogen and phosphorus make steel brittle, so these elements must be removed during processing. The density of steel varies depending on the constituent elements, but is generally between 7,750 and 8,050 kg/m3 (484 and 503 lb/cu ft), or 775 and 805 g/cm3 (448 and 465 oz/cu in).

At room temperature, the most stable form of iron is the body-centered cubic (BCC) structure called ferrite or \u03b1-iron. This iron is a soft metal that can only dissolve carbon in small concentrations, no more than 0.021 wt% at 723\u00b0C (1.333\u00b0F), and only 0.005% at 0\u00b0C (32\u00b0F). At 910\u00b0C pure iron transforms into a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure, which is called austenite or \u03b3-iron. The austenitic FCC structure can dissolve more carbon, up to 2.1% (the carbon is 38 times that of ferrite) at 1,148\u00b0C (2,098\u00b0F), which is called cast iron. When steel with a carbon content of less than 0.8% is heated, the mixed austenitic phase (FCC) tries to convert into the ferrite phase (BCC), producing excess carbon. The carbon content therein no longer fits within the FCC austenite structure. One of the ways for the carbon content to be released from the austenite is to use a liquid solution deposition reaction of the material to become cementite, so that there remains around the BCC phase iron which is called ferrite which has a lower carbon content. These two solutions, ferrite and cementite, precipitate together and form a layered structure called pearlite, so named because of its similarity to the material mother of pearl. In a hypereutectoid composition (carbon content above 0.8%), the carbon will precipitate first in the form of cementite, into the austenite grain edges until the percentage of carbon in the grains decreases to a eutectoid composition (0.8% carbon), at the same time a pearlite structure is formed. For steels that have a hypoeutectoid composition (carbon content below 0.8%), ferrite will form in the iron grains until the other composition will rise to 0.8% carbon parts, while a pearlite structure will form at the same time.",

With an increase in the sprinkling rate, the carbon will have less time to form carbide on the grain edges but will produce a greater amount of finer and finer pearlite in the grain structure; that is the reason why the carbide is spread far apart and acts as a defect preventer within the grain, resulting in a steel structure pavement. In the very high speed cooling produced by the flush process, the carbon content no longer has time to migrate but is locked in the middle of the austenite surface and forms martensite. Martensite is a supersaturated form of carbon and iron that is also highly compressed and loaded making it extremely hard but brittle and inelastic. Depending on the carbon content, the martensitic phase itself takes several forms. Below 0.2% carbon content, BCC ferrite crystals will form, but at higher carbon content martenite will form a centralized tetragonal structure (BCT). There is no activation of heat energy for the change of state from austenite to martensite. need clarification] Moreover, there is no compositional change so that the constituent atoms usually do not change partners. Martensite has a lower density than austenite because it expands when cooled, so the only change in state between them is a change in volume. In this case, development occurs. The internal loads from this expansion are usually physical compression of the martensite crystals and pressures of the remaining ferrite, and considerable displacement of both. If flushing is not carried out properly, the internal loads in the steel will cause the structure to break upon cooling. At a minimum this will cause pavement work and other imperfections.",

There are various heat treatments commonly used in steel processing. The most frequently used heat treatments are annealing, quenching, and tempering. Annealing is the heat treatment of steel which is done by heating the steel to a high enough temperature to make the steel malleable. This process occurs in three stages, recovery, recrystallization, and grain growth. The temperature required for annealing depends on the type of annealing and the alloy content of the steel. Quenching and tempering initially involve heating the steel until the phase changes to austenitic and then cooling it using an oil or water cooling medium. The sudden drop in temperature results in a hard and brittle martensite structure. The steel is then processed through a tempering process which is a type of annealing. In this process part of the martensite structure will turn into cementite, or spheroidite to reduce internal stresses and defects in the steel, making the steel more ductile and more resistant to cracking. Understanding the erection process in steel construction in general is a process consisting of assembling steel components so that they become a single unit that is carried out in the field. The erection process consists of lifting and placing the steel components into the desired position, then connecting them together. After the iron has gone through the smelting process from the ore, it will contain excess carbon. To make normal steel, it needs to be melted down and reprocessed to reduce the carbon content to the desired amount, after which other elements can be added.

The cold or hot billets are rolled into bars, sticks, and wires. Forging is cold or hot rolled into structural steel, such as I-beam and rail iron. In a modern steel mill these processes occur on an assembly line, iron ore in and steel product out. Sometimes after the steel has been rolled it is then heat treated to increase strength, but this is rarely done. It is common to hear the term \"iron and steel industry\" as a whole, but from a historical perspective they are distinct products.

The name Eukaryota is derived from the Greek \u03b5\u03c5 (eu, \"good\") and \u03ba\u03ac\u03c1\u03c5\u03bf\u03bd (karyon, \"nut\" or \"kernel\"). Eukaryotic cells also contain other membrane-bound organelles such as mitochondria and the Golgi apparatus. Moreover, plants and algae contain chloroplasts. Eukaryotic organisms can be unicellular or multicellular. Only eukaryotes have many types of tissues made up of different cell types. Eukaryotes can reproduce both through asexual reproduction through mitosis and sexual reproduction through meiosis. In mitosis, one cell divides to produce two genetically identical cells. In meiosis, DNA replication is followed by two rounds of cell division to produce four daughter cells each with half the number of chromosomes of the parent cell (haploid cells).

Eukaryotic cells have a variety of membrane-bound structures, which collectively are called the endomembrane system. Simple spaces, called vesicles or vacuoles, can form by separation from other membranes. Many cells ingest food and other materials by a process called endocytosis, in which the outer membrane bends inward and then breaks off to form a vesicle. It is probable that many other membranous organelles originate from such vesicles. The cell nucleus is covered by a double membrane, which has pores that allow materials to pass in and out. Various tubular or sheet-shaped extensions of the nuclear membrane make up the endoplasmic reticulum (or ER), which is involved in the transport and maturation of proteins. The ER consists of rough ER that has attached ribosomes, and the proteins synthesized by those ribosomes enter the inner space or lumen. Then, usually they enter the vesicles, which separate from the smooth ER. In most eukaryotes, these protein-carrying vesicles are released and modified in stacks of flattened vesicles called Golgi bodies or dictyosomes. Vesicles can specialize for a variety of uses. For example, lysosomes have enzymes that break down the contents of food vacuoles, and peroxisomes, whose function is to break down peroxides, which are toxic. many protozoa have contractile vacuoles, which collect and dispose of excess water and extrusomes, which secrete materials used to fight predators or capture prey.

In general, geography is divided into two branches of science, namely physical geography and human geography. After 1945, geography was more directed to social sciences and prioritized the study of human geography. Geography has important concepts that are used to understand the relationship, form, and function of natural events and social events. Erastothenes was the first to use the term geography. The word geography comes from a combination of words in Greek, namely the words geo and graphein. Geo means earth and graphein means writing or painting, so geography is defined as writing about the earth. In a broader sense, geography is defined as the study of the earth. The earth in question is not only related to its physical form, but includes all natural phenomena and processes that occur along with the symptoms and processes of life. The symptoms and processes of life also discuss the life of the inhabitants of the earth, namely plants, animals and humans. The term geography became known and spread widely among scholars in the 1st century AD. Knowledge of geography has been known since the days of Ancient Greece. At that time, mythology still had a lot of influence on knowledge about the earth. The influence of mythology diminished after natural sciences began to develop from the 6th century BC. The basis of natural sciences and exact sciences began to form knowledge about the earth. The investigation of the earth began to make use of logic.

Travelers no longer just want to know the physical geography, but have certain goals in their journey. Travelers try to find new areas that can provide a source of economic benefits. This search for profits is done by forming colonies or trading. The travelers also have a purpose related to religion. While trading or forming colonies, they also spread the religion they believe in to new areas. This goal is considered a sacred duty in the context of developing religious teachings. In addition, knowledge about new areas can also be obtained due to war. The desire to seek economic profit and the spread of religion can lead to social conflicts in various different interests. This difference in interests then creates a conflict that triggers a war to fight for the influence of power. The nature of geography writing is still descriptive in nature even though geographical discoveries have been made with economic, religious and power goals. In addition, the explanations given have not been written by taking into account the observed symptoms. Travelers also travel to explore new areas to serve as an adventure. The results of these adventures are then used to increase knowledge about the earth. At this time there was also rapid development of the mathematical concept of geography. Scholars began to gain latitude as the influence of the church began to wane. Scholars in the natural sciences began to make discoveries that contradicted the church's interpretation of the Bible. Geographical knowledge began to be studied in depth since the discoveries by natural science scholars in the 17th century AD. Influential figures were Isaac Newton (1629-1695), Robert Boyle (1627-1691), and Christiaan Huygens (1629- 1695).

Apart from that, the meaning of geography was still simple and only meant knowledge about the earth. At the end of the 18th century, a view of geography as a scientific discipline began to develop. In addition, geography is also starting to be seen as knowledge that can be used practically. On the other hand, the understanding of human geography experienced a decline among scholars in the early and mid-19th century AD. The decline in knowledge occurred in Western Europe, especially in England and Berlin. In England, the science of human geography did not develop after Alexander Maconochie resigned from his job as a human geography scientist. At the University of Berlin, human geography did not progress. The cause was the absence of a successor from a geographer named Carl Ritter who died in 1859. At the end of the 19th century AD, the science of geography was more focused on geological knowledge and scientific methods related to geology. The studies carried out prioritize climate, plants and animals, as well as natural landscapes. In the United States, geography is experiencing rapid development among scientists of applied science. Landscapes and water resources began to be studied by John Wesley Powell (1834-1902). This knowledge is then used to determine the best use of land in a place. Resource conservation also began to be considered and studied by George Perkins Marsh (1801-1882). Marsh expressed his views on resource conservation in the introduction to his book Man and Nature, or Physical Geography as Modified by Human Action (1864). Marsh developed the thoughts of Alexander von Humboldt and Ritter to express his thoughts on human influence on natural destruction.

Geographers then use a mathematical understanding of spatial relationships to derive new insights about geography. in particular the geographical location of cities and their interactions. In addition, there were developments in human geography. Investigations into human geography no longer have a specific purpose but use scientific research. The approach used in research is neoclassical economic theories with the concepts of Marxism, feminism, post-colonialism and post-modernism. At this time, geography has been used to solve various problems faced by humans. Geography as a scientific field then began to be combined with various other scientific disciplines. In addition, geographic research has also used statistical methods and quantitative methods and utilized the use of computer tools to process and analyze data. Geographical data procurement has also used satellite imagery so that the information obtained is more precise and accurate. The use of satellite imagery in geographic research studies was pioneered by geographers from the United States and Sweden in 1960 by applying quantitative methods. Satellite imagery is used in physical geography and other branches of geography with the help of computer tools. The use of satellite imagery is then applied in various developed countries. Geography has two objects of discussion, namely material objects and formal objects. The material object of geography is the phenomenon of the geosphere which includes all inanimate objects and living things on the earth and its environment. Discussion of the geosphere consists of five layers, namely the atmosphere, lithosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and anthroposphere. The atmosphere, lithosphere, and hydrosphere discuss inanimate matter on earth. The atmosphere discusses the air that envelops the earth, the lithosphere discusses the earth's crust, while the hydrosphere discusses water. Biosphere and antrosphere discuss living things.",

This perspective is then accompanied by a way of thinking and analyzing the material. The approach used to create a perspective on material objects is through analysis. Analysis that can be applied in geography is spatial analysis, environmental analysis, and regional analysis. Location is the concept of the existence of an object on earth related to a place or location of an area. The concept of location is divided into absolute location and relative location. Absolute location can be known by looking at latitude and longitude, while relative location is a location that changes places. Absolute location conditions are fixed and guided by earth astronomy. Latitude is used to determine climate differences, while longitude is used to determine time differences. In geographic studies, relative location is used more than absolute location. Relative location is used to determine geographic location. The concept of distance is used in social, economic and political life. Humans use the concept of distance to obtain various advantages. In geography, the concept of distance is divided into absolute distance and relative distance. The difference between absolute distance and relative distance is in the units used. Absolute distance is expressed in meters or kilometers, while relative distance is expressed in units of time. In geography, morphology is the concept of the shape of the earth's surface. This form is obtained through natural processes. Morphology links between natural processes and their relationship with human activities. In geography, affordability is defined as an ease in accessing the distance traveled. This convenience is related to the availability of facilities and infrastructure.",

Patterns can also be formed through interactions between the environment around humans and other environments. The discussion of patterns in geography relates to the distribution of natural phenomena on earth. Agglomeration is a concept of population grouping. The grouping is based on the activities carried out by humans in an area or area. Use value relates to the benefits provided by an area on earth to living things. This utility value is relative and varies in each region. Use value in an area is distinguished into an advantage and a disadvantage. The development of useful value is useful for increasing the welfare of a region. Interdependence is the concept of interdependence between one region and another. Each region can influence and be influenced by other regions because of interactions to meet needs. The interactions that occur later form communication, trade and migration between regions. Area differentiation is related to comparisons between regions which are known through the differences that exist. Each region has a uniqueness that distinguishes it from other regions. Room linkages provide an explanation of the level of linkages between regions due to interactions. The type of interaction that occurs is a causal relationship in each region. Spatial analysis is a unique approach in geography because it is the study of the diversity of the earth's surface by examining each of its spatial aspects. Aspects of the earth's surface include location factors, natural conditions, and socio-cultural conditions of the people. In studying these aspects, a geographer is very concerned about the factors of location, distribution (spread), interrelation and interaction. One example of this spatial approach is a piece of land that is expensive because the soil is fertile, and is located by the roadside.",

The environmental approach is based on one of the principles in the discipline of biology, namely the prominent interrelation between living things and their environment. In the analysis of the geographical environment examines the symptoms of interaction, and the interrelationships between physical (natural) and non-physical (social) components. The ecological approach conducts analysis by looking at changes in biotic and abiotic components in the balance of an ecosystem in a region. For example, a pasture abandoned by a herd of grazing animals will lead to changes in land use, and competition for occupants. Regional complex analysis compares various regions on earth by taking into account the spatial and environmental aspects of each region in a comprehensive manner. For example, the polar region is certainly very different from the characteristics of the equatorial region. The principle of distribution is the earliest principle used to study geographic phenomena and facts. The use of this principle is based on the uneven distribution of various geographical phenomena on earth. The forms of phenomena that use the principle of distribution are landscapes, plants, animals and humans. A phenomenon can be explained in a directed way through the principle of distribution. In addition, the principle of distribution can also explain the relationship between phenomena. The principle of relatedness is a continuation of the principle of distribution. Phenomena whose distribution patterns and facts are known, are linked to one another. The principle of interrelatedness is based on the fact that humans and nature have an interrelated relationship. This relationship can occur between humans and humans, nature and nature, or nature and humans. The principle of depiction is a principle that explains the relationship between phenomena and their distribution in one space. The space boundary described is the geosphere.",

The principle of chorology is a combination of the principle of distribution, the principle of connection and the principle of depiction. In the principle of chorology, analysis of the distribution of geographic symptoms and problems is carried out by observing aspects that influence interaction. The principles of chorology are applied to modern geography. Ptolemy's world map reconstructed from Ptolemy's Geographia (c. 150) in the 15th century, indicating \"Sinae\" (China) on the extreme right, outside the islands of \"Taprobane\" (Sri Lanka, large), and \"Aurea Chersonesus\" (Southeast Asia ). Ptolemy also designed, and provided instructions on how to make maps of the inhabited world (oikoumen\u00e8), and of the Roman provinces. In the second part of his Geographia he gives a list of the topography required, and annotations for the maps. His Oikoumen\u00e8 spans 180 degrees of longitude from the Canary Islands in the Atlantic Ocean to China, and about 80 degrees of latitude from the Arctic, east India to deep into Africa; Ptolemy realized that he knew only a quarter of the world . Spatial relations are key to this synoptic science, and it uses maps as its main tool. Classical cartography is combined with a more modern geographic analysis approach to produce a computer-based Geographic Information System (GIS). Geographers use four approaches: Geographical aspects are based on the structure of the environment. Based on the structure of the environment, geography can be divided into physical aspects and non-physical aspects. The physical aspects of geography include topological, biotic and non-biotic aspects. While the non-physical aspect prioritizes the study of human behavior. Non-physical aspects include social aspects, economic aspects, cultural aspects, and political aspects.

Related topics: Countries of the world - countries - nations - states - associations of individuals - provinces - counties - cities - districts. During the era of environmental determinism, geography was not a science of spatial relations, but of how humans and their environment interact. Although understanding of environmental determinism has not developed, there is still a strong tradition among geographers to study the relationship between humans and nature. There are two fields in human-environmental geography: cultural ecology, and politics, and disaster-risk research. Human characteristics that must fulfill their life needs, must make use of nature or natural exploitation in order to fulfill the needs of life. This branch of geography is a relatively new one. Developed around the 1980s by European geographers, especially from the Netherlands. When the university collaboration between the two countries was carried out, a number of geographers from the Netherlands participated in the lecturer transplantation program at UGM. The result was the birth of a new study program called the Regional Development Planning Study Program, and now better known as the Regional Development Study Program.",

In addition, it can be explained that regional planning and development can be related to social sciences, especially related to social phenomena that occur in society, so that they are very in touch with existing social concepts and theories. Cultural ecology emerged as a result of Carl Sauer's work in geography, and thought in anthropology. Cultural ecology studies how humans adapt to their natural environment. The science of sustainability (sustainability) then grew out of this tradition. Political ecology arose when some geographers used aspects of critical geography to look at the relationship of natural forces, and how they affect humans. For example, the influential study by Michael Watts argued that famine in the Sahel was caused by changes in the region's political and economic system as a result of colonialism, and the spread of capitalist practices. Research on disasters was started by Gilbert F. Withe, who tried to understand why people live in floodplains that are prone to disasters. Since then, the field has developed into a multi-disciplinary field, studying natural disasters (such as earthquakes) and technological disasters (such as nuclear reactor leaks). Geographers who study disasters are interested in the dynamics of disasters, and how humans and society deal with them. This branch seeks to explain how cultures from different parts of the world developed, and became what they are today. The study of the earth's surface is one of the keys to this field - many conclusions are drawn about the influence of ancient societies on the environment, and beyond. \"Historical Geography\" is, of course, the trade-off of geography and history. But in the United States, it has a more specific meaning. This name was coined by Carl Ortwin Sauer of the University of California, Berkeley with his program of reorganizing cultural geography (some say all geography) across all regions, beginning in the early 20th century.",

Sauer emphasized area studies as the only way to get specific to a region of the earth. Sauer's philosophy was a major shaper of geographical thought in America in the mid-20th century. Until now regional studies is still part of the geography department on campuses in the US. But many geographers think this will harm the science of geography itself in the long term: the reason is that there is too much data collection, and classification, and too little analysis, and explanation. These studies became more region specific as later generations of geographers struggled to find proper names for these. Perhaps this is what caused the 1950s crisis in geography which nearly destroyed it as an academic discipline. Remote sensing is the science of obtaining information about objects or phenomena on the earth's surface without direct contact with the object or phenomenon being studied. Observation and collection of information is carried out using certain sensors. The sensors used can capture and record reflections of light or other energy sources and then convert them into data that can be explained, analyzed and applied in real terms. The concept of remote sensing is very similar to how the human eye works. The sensors used in remote sensing are mounted on platforms in the form of satellites or airplanes. Satellites are used for remote sensing from outer space, while airplanes are used for sensing inside the Earth's atmosphere. The results of remote sensing with satellites are called satellite images, while the results of sensing with aircraft are called aerial photographs. Remote sensing is obtained through recording media of objects or phenomena that utilize energy originating from electromagnetic waves, and manifests the recording results in the form of images.",

In a narrow sense, it means that there is no contact between the object and the analyst, for example when satellite image data is processed and transformed into a surface temperature distribution map at the time of recording. Broadly speaking this means that contact is possible in the form of 'ground truth' activities, namely the collection of field samples to serve as the basis for modeling through interpolation, and extrapolation over a much wider area, and at a higher level of detail. Initially remote sensing was viewed less as part of geography than cartography. Nevertheless, gradually it is realized that remote sensing is the only major tool in geography that is able to provide a synoptic overview\u2014a brief but comprehensive view\u2014of an area as a starting point for further study. Remote sensing is also capable of producing various kinds of spatial information in an ecological and regional context which characterizes geographic studies. In addition, in terms of percentage, remote sensing education in the United States, Australia and Europe is mostly provided by geography science institutions (departments, schools or faculties). In terms of the methods used, there are manual or visual remote sensing methods and digital remote sensing methods. Manual remote sensing utilizes printed images (aerial photographs, scanned images from aircraft and satellite scanners) through manual/visual analysis and interpretation. Digital remote sensing uses images in digital format, for example digital camera shots, scanned aerial photographs that have been printed, and scanned by satellite sensors, and analyzes them with the help of a computer. Both manual and digital methods produce maps, and reports. Maps resulting from the manual method can be converted into digital thematic maps through a digitization process (often termed digitization).",

These maps henceforth become the point of departure for geographers in carrying out their geographical studies. Cartography or mapping studies the representation of the earth's surface with abstract symbols. You could say, without much controversy, cartography is the cause of the widespread study of geography. Most geographers admit that their interest in geography began when they were fascinated by maps in their childhood. although other sub-disciplines of geography still rely on maps to display the results of their analysis, mapmaking itself is still too abstract to be considered as a separate science. Cartography developed from a collection of drawing techniques to become part of a science. A cartographer must understand cognitive psychology, and ergonomics to create appropriate symbols to represent information about the earth that others can understand effectively, and behavioral psychology to influence readers to understand the information they create. They also have to study geodesy, and beyond simple mathematics to understand how the shape of the earth affects the distortion or distortion of the projection onto a plane. Geographic Information System addresses the problem of storing information relating to the existence of an object or phenomenon on earth.

Meanwhile, attribute data can be obtained through statistics, field measurements, or censuses. Geographical quantitative methods discusses the numerical methods that are typical (or at least those that are widely found) in geography. In addition to spatial analysis, you may find cluster analysis, discriminant analysis, and non-parametric statistical tests in geographic studies. Urban and territorial planning uses geography to help learn how to develop (or not develop) land according to certain criteria, such as security, beauty, economic opportunity, protection of natural or cultural heritage, etc. Urban planning, both small towns and cities, or rural planning might be considered applied geography even though it might seem like more of an art, and history lesson. Some of the problems faced by regional planners include the exodus of rural and urban communities, and Smart Growth. In the 1950s, the regional science movement emerged, led by Walter Isard to provide a more quantitative, and analytical basis for geographic problems, in response to the qualitative approach to traditional geography courses. Regional science contains knowledge of how the spatial dimension plays an important role, such as regional economics, resource management, location theory, urban and regional planning, transportation and communication, human geography, population distribution, earth's ecology, and environmental quality.

The most marginalized people are the Indians. In 1990, it was estimated that over 40% of Indians aged fifteen and over could not read. This has created a stark educational gap among the Mexican people. However, the government has tried its best to promote the development of education among its youth. Among other things, the government has stipulated that education is compulsory until the sixth grade. Unfortunately, due to financial pressures, most students from the lower classes are more interested in working than attending school. In Mexico, there is no law requiring secondary education. In elementary school they study math, social studies, \"grammar\", writing, reading and sports. Meanwhile, moral and family values \u200b\u200bare learned at home. The interest in increasing income through working children in a family means a choice between \"survival\" and education. However, in the past five years attendance at school has increased: UNICEF reports 84% \u200b\u200bof children starting school will reach grade five. Lower student dropout rates mean more youth will go on to high school, and this can help reduce poverty. Today, more than 8 million youth are enrolled in secondary schools, which is 2 million more than in 1994. The government under President Ernesto Zedillo has made efforts to develop education in the country. In fact, \u00b125% of government spending has been channeled towards education.

Patagonia is located in Argentina and Chile. The name Patagonia comes from the word patag\u00f3n used by Magellan to describe the indigenous people his expedition suspected were giants. It is now believed that the Patagon were a Tehuelche with an average height of 1.80 m (~5'11\") compared to the average height of the Spaniards at the time, 1.55 m (~5'1\"). To the east of the Andes, Patagonia lies south of the Neuqu\u00e9n and Colorado rivers, and to the west of the Andes, lies south of 39\u00b0S, excluding the Chilo\u00e9 Archipelago. To the east of the Andes, Patagonia, which lies in Argentina, includes the provinces of Neuqu\u00e9n, R\u00edo Negro , Chubut, Santa Cruz, and Tierra del Fuego, as well as the southern provinces of Buenos Aires, Mendoza and La Pampa. The Chilean part of Patagonia includes the southern part of the Los Lagos, Ais\u00e9n and Magallanes regions. Patagonia does not include the portion of Antarctica claimed by Chile and Argentina. Human habitation in this region dates back thousands of years, with archaeological discoveries dating back to 13,000 BC, although those around 10,000 BC are better recognized. There is evidence of human activity in Monte Verde, Llanquihue Province, Chile, dating back to around 12,500 BC. The ice fields during the Ice Age and the melting ice streams made settlement difficult at that time. The area has been continuously inhabited since 10,000 BC, with various cultures and waves of migration, although more information is not known. Several sites have been excavated, important caves such as Cueva del Milodon on \u00daltima Esperanza, southern Patagonia, and Tres Arroyos on Tierra del Fuego.

It is not known whether Patagonia's megafauna became extinct before the arrival of humans. It is also unclear whether domestic dogs are part of human activity. Bolas guns were found and used to catch guanako and rhea. The maritime tradition arose with the Y\u00e1manas south of the Beagle Strait. Indigenous people to the region included the Tehuelche, whose numbers dwindled to a near extinction shortly after the first contact with Europeans. The Tehuelche includes Gununa'kena in the north, Mecharnuekenk in central south Patagonia and Aonikenk or South Tehuelche in the south, north of the Straits of Magellan. On Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego, Selk'nam (Ona) and Haush (Mannekenk) live to the north and southeast. On the islands south of Tierra del Fuego live the Y\u00e1mana, with Kaw\u00e9skar (Alakaluf) on the coast and islands west of Tierra del Fuego and southwest of the mainland. The territory of Patagonia was first recorded by Europeans in 1520 by Fernando de Magellan, who was on his way past the shores of San Matias Bay, Cape Virgenes and others. It is possible that navigators such as Amerigo Vespucci had reached this area (his records in 1502 stated he reached the latitude of Patagonia), but he failed to describe the geography of the Patagonia region.

The settlements he founded at Nombre de Dios and San Felipe were neglected by the Spanish authorities, abandoned before Thomas Cavendish visited them in 1587 and were so remote that Thomas Cavendish nicknamed them \"Port of the Hunger\" (Puerto Hambre). The district around Puerto Deseado, which was explored by John Davis in the same period, was made a colony by Sir John Narborough on behalf of Charles II of England in 1669. According to Antonio Pigafetta, one of the Magellan expedition's few survivors and its published chronicler, Magellan bestowed the name \"Patag\u00e3o\" (or Patag\u00f3n) on the inhabitants they encountered there, and the name \"Patagonia\" for the region. Although Pigafetta's account does not describe how this name came about, subsequent popular interpretations gave credence to a derivation meaning 'land of the big feet'. However, this etymology is questionable. The term is most likely derived from an actual character name, \"Patag\u00f3n\", a savage creature confronted by Primale\u00f3n of Greece, the hero in the homonymous Spanish chivalry novel (or knight-errantry tale) by Francisco V\u00e1zquez.

This supposed race of Patagonian giants or Patagones entered into the common European perception of this little-known and distant area, to be further fuelled by subsequent reports of other expeditions and famous-name travellers like Sir Francis Drake, which seemed to confirm these accounts. Early charts of the New World sometimes added the legend regio gigantum (\"region of the giants\") to the Patagonian area. By 1611 the Patagonian god Setebos (Settaboth in Pigafetta) was familiar to the hearers of The Tempest. The concept and general belief persisted for a further 250 years, and was to be sensationally re-ignited in 1767 when an \"official\" (but anonymous) account was published of Commodore John Byron's recent voyage of global circumnavigation in HMS Dolphin. Byron and crew had spent some time along the coast, and the publication (Voyage Round the World in His Majesty's Ship the Dolphin) seemed to give proof positive of their existence; the publication became an overnight best-seller, thousands of extra copies were to be sold to a willing public, and other prior accounts of the region were hastily re-published (even those in which giant-like folk were not mentioned at all).",

In this publication, drawn from their official logs, it became clear that the people Byron's expedition had encountered were no taller than 6-foot 6 inches, tall perhaps but by no means giants.

Thomas Falkner, a Jesuit who resided near forty years in those parts, published his Description of Patagonia (Hereford, 1774); Francesco Viedma founded El Carmen, and Antonio advanced inland to the Andes (1782); and Basilio Villarino ascended the Rio Negro (1782).

Tea was not enjoyed in limited circles so the habit of drinking tea never became popular. In the Kamakura period, priests Eisai and Dogen spread Zen teachings in Japan while introducing matcha he brought from China as a medicine. Tea and Zen teachings became popular as major elements in spiritual enlightenment. Tea planting then began to be carried out everywhere in line with the increasingly widespread habit of drinking tea.

The tea ceremony must also be a means of exchanging spiritual experiences between the host and the party being served.

The tea ceremony, which has become increasingly popular among the people, has also had a negative impact on tea ceremonies, which have begun to be carried out not as seriously as if they were playing games. Some tea ceremony teachers try to prevent decline in the tea ceremony by emphasizing the spiritual value of the tea ceremony. At that time, Daitokuji Temple, which is a Rinzai sect temple, played an important role in introducing the spiritual value of the tea ceremony as well as giving birth to the principle of Wakeiseijaku which originated from the Riky\u016b school of tea ceremony.

In an effort to put his thoughts and opinions, ancient Greek philosophers often tried to refute other thoughts by showing the fallacy of their reasoning. Logic is used to do the proof. Logic says which forms of inference are valid and which are not. Traditionally, logic was studied as a branch of philosophy, but it can also be considered a branch of mathematics.

Aristotle's traditional syllogistic logic and modern symbolic logic are examples of formal logic. There are two basic reasoning in logic, namely deductive and inductive. Deductive reasoning, sometimes called deductive logic, is reasoning that constructs or evaluates deductive arguments. An argument is declared deductive if the truth of the conclusion is drawn or is a logical consequence of its premises. Deductive arguments are declared valid or invalid, not true or false. A deductive argument is valid if and only if its conclusion is a logical consequence of its premises. Examples of deductive arguments: Inductive reasoning, sometimes called inductive logic, is reasoning that departs from a specific set of facts to reach a general conclusion. Examples of inductive arguments: The table below shows some of the main features that differentiate inductive and deductive reasoning. Logic begins with Thales (624 BC - 548 BC), the first Greek philosopher who abandoned all fairy tales, superstitions and fictional stories and turned to reason to solve the secrets of the universe. Thales said that water is arkhe (Greek) which means the main principle or principle of the universe. At that time Thales had introduced inductive logic. Aristotle then introduced logic as a science, which was then called logica scientica. Aristotle says that Thales drew the conclusion that water is the archetype of the universe on the grounds that water is the soul of all things. In Thales logic, water is the archeology of the universe which according to Aristotle concluded from: So, water is the soul of all things, which means, water is the archetype of the universe.

The essence of Aristotle's logic is the syllogism. Aristotle's book to Oraganon (tools) numbered six, namely: In 370 BC - 288 BC Theophrastus, Aristotle's student who became leader of the Lyceum, continued the development of logic. The term logic was first introduced by Zeno from Citium 334 BC - 226 BC the pioneer of the Stoics. The systematization of logic occurred during the time of Galenus (130 AD - 201 AD) and Sextus Empiricus 200 AD, two medical doctors who developed logic by applying the geometric method. Porohyus (232 - 305) makes an introduction to the Categoriae, one of Aristotle's books. Boethius (480-524) translated the Eisagoge Porphyrius into Latin and added comments.

Cladistics is considered a development of phenetics, a method of quantitative grouping in biological systematics based on morphological similarities. Somewhat different from phenetics, cladistics bases itself on evolutionary and molecular characteristics. This science is widely used in phylogeny. When applied in phylogeny, the similarity of molecular traits quantified and supported by cladistic outputs is given an evolutionary meaning. Therefore, in cladistics grouping is always directed at forming a complete clade (including all the components included in it). Due to its more universal nature, cladistics is now also used in other fields, such as literature and linguistics. An example of its application in literature is its use in grouping various manuscript versions of the Canterbury Tales. In historical linguistics, cladistics is used to regroup Austronesian languages. The output of branched cladistics is a cladogram, a type of diagram that is considered to represent the kinship relationships among grouped organisms. Cladograms have much in common with evolutionary trees. Cladograms are made by utilizing hundreds of thousands to millions of genetic information, both in the form of markers and DNA and RNA sequences. Clad is the main study in cladistics. There are three situations in grouping based on cladistics: monophile (from monophyly; the adjective form is monophyletic, from monophyletic; synonym is holophile), paraphile, and polyphile (from polyphyly). A grouping using cladistics must produce a complete clade, which is called monophyletic. This principle is used in modern plant classification, which for flowering plants has resulted in the widely accepted APG III (and APG II) classification system among botanists.",

In sexually reproducing species, new gene combinations are also produced by genetic recombination, which can increase variation between organisms. Evolution occurs when these inherited differences become more common or rare within a population. Evolution is driven by two main mechanisms, namely natural selection and genetic drift. Natural selection is a process that causes inherited traits that are useful for the survival and reproduction of organisms to become more common in a population - and conversely, traits that are detrimental to them become less. This happens because individuals with favorable traits are more likely to reproduce, so that more individuals in the next generation inherit these beneficial traits. Over many generations, adaptation occurs through the combination of these small, continuous and random changes in traits with natural selection. Meanwhile, genetic drift (English: Genetic Drift) is an independent process that produces random changes in the frequency of a population trait. Genetic drift results from the probability of whether a trait will be inherited when an individual survives and reproduces.",

This process culminates in producing a new species. And in fact, the similarities between organisms suggest that all the species we know came from a common ancestor by this slowly diverging process. Documentation of the facts of evolution is carried out by a branch of biology called evolutionary biology. This branch also develops and tests theories explaining the causes of evolution. Studies of the fossil record and the biodiversity of living organisms convinced scientists in the mid-19th century that species changed over time. However, the mechanisms driving these changes remained unclear until Charles Darwin's 1859 publication, On the Origin of Species, which detailed the theory of evolution by natural selection. Darwin's work was quickly followed by the acceptance of the theory of evolution in the scientific community. In 1930, Darwin's theory of natural selection combined with Mendelian inheritance to form the modern evolutionary synthesis, which links the units of evolution (genes) to the mechanism of evolution (natural selection). The theory's explanatory and predictive power drives research that continually raises new questions, which have become a central principle of modern biology providing a more comprehensive explanation of the diversity of life on Earth. Although the theory of evolution is always associated with Charles Darwin, in fact, evolutionary biology has its roots since the time of Aristotle. However, Darwin was the first scientist to come up with a theory of evolution that has proven itself well in the face of scientific scrutiny. Until now, Darwin's theory of evolution as a result of natural selection is considered by the majority of the scientific community to be the best theory in explaining evolution.",

Some with similar thoughts include Empedocles, Lucretius, Arab biologist Al Jahiz, Persian philosopher Ibn Miskawaih, Ikhwan As-Shafa, and Chinese philosopher Zhuangzi. Along with the development of biological knowledge in the 18th century, evolutionary thinking began to be traced by several philosophers such as Pierre Maupertuis in 1745 and Erasmus Darwin in 1796. The thoughts of the biologist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck on the transmutation of species had a broad influence. Charles Darwin formulated his theory of natural selection in 1838 and was still developing his theory in 1858 when Alfred Russel Wallace sent him a similar theory in his \"Letter from Ternate\". Both were submitted to the Linnean Society of London as two separate works. In late 1859, Darwin's publication On the Origin of Species described natural selection in detail and provided the evidence that led to the widespread acceptance of evolution in the scientific community. The debate over the mechanisms of evolution continued, and Darwin could not explain the sources of heritable variation selected for by natural selection. Like Lamarck, he believed that parents passed on the adaptations he had acquired throughout his life, a theory that became known as Lamarckism. In the 1880s, August Weismann's experiments indicated that these changes were not inherited, and Lamarkism was gradually abandoned. In addition, Darwin could not explain how traits were passed from one generation to another. In 1865, Gregor Mendel discovered that the inheritance of traits can be predicted. When Mendel's work was rediscovered in the 1900s, the discrepancy over the rate of evolution predicted by geneticists and biometricists strained Mendelian and Darwinian models of evolution.",

Natural selection uses this variation to shape the variety of adaptive traits observed in living organisms. Although Hugo de Vries and other geneticists were initially highly critical of the theory of evolution, the rediscovery of genetics and subsequent research eventually provided a solid foundation for evolution, even more convincing than when the theory was first proposed. The contradictions between Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection and Mendel's work were put together in the 1920s and 1930s by evolutionary biologists such as J.B.S. Haldane, Sewall Wright, and especially Ronald Fisher, who laid down the foundations of population genetics. The result is the combination of evolution by natural selection with Mendelian inheritance into the modern evolutionary synthesis. In the 1940s, the identification of DNA as the genetic material by Oswald Avery et al. together with the publication of the structure of DNA by James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953, provided the physical basis for this inheritance. Since that time, genetics and molecular biology have become the core of evolutionary biology and have revolutionized phylogenetics. Early in its history, evolutionary biologists were primarily taxonomically oriented scientists. As the modern evolutionary synthesis developed, evolutionary biology attracted more and more scientists from other fields of the biological sciences. Contemporary evolutionary biology studies involve scientists working in the fields of biochemistry, ecology, genetics, and physiology. The concept of evolution is also used further in fields such as psychology, medicine, philosophy, and computer science. The evolution of organisms occurs through changes in inherited traits. Eye color in humans, for example, is one of these inherited traits.",

The overall properties that are observed in the behavior and structure of organisms are referred to as phenotypes. These traits come from the interaction of the genotype with the environment. Therefore, not every aspect of an organism's phenotype is inherited. The dark skin that results from sun exposure comes from the interaction between a person's genotype and sunlight; so that this dark skin color will not be passed on to that person's offspring. Even so, humans have different responses to sunlight, and this is caused by differences in their genotypes. An example is an individual with albino traits whose skin will not darken and is very sensitive to sunburn. Inherited traits are passed between generations via DNA, a molecule that can store genetic information. DNA is a polymer consisting of four types of nucleotide bases. The sequence of bases in a particular DNA molecule determines the genetic information. The part of the DNA molecule that defines a functional unit is called a gene; Different genes have different base sequences. Within cells, long strands of DNA associate with proteins, forming compact structures called chromosomes. The specific location on a chromosome is known as a locus. If the DNA sequence at a locus varies between individuals, the different forms of this sequence are called alleles. The DNA sequence can change through mutations, producing new alleles. If a mutation occurs in a gene, the new allele can affect the individual trait controlled by the gene, causing a change in the phenotype of the organism. However, while these examples show how alleles and traits work in some cases, most traits are more complex and controlled by the interaction of multiple genes. The phenotype of an individual organism results from the genotype and environmental influences of the organism.",

        "paragraph": "Substantial phenotypic variation in a population results from differences in its genotypes. The modern evolutionary synthesis defines evolution as the change over time in these genetic variations. The frequency of a particular allele will fluctuate, becoming more common or less common relative to other forms of that gene. Evolutionary driving forces work by driving changes in these allele frequencies in one direction or another. Variation disappears when an allele reaches a fixation point, i.e. when it disappears from a population or it has replaced all ancestral alleles. Variation comes from mutations in genetic material, migration between populations (gene flow), and changes in gene arrangement through sexual reproduction. Variation also comes from the exchange of genes between different species; for example through horizontal gene transfer in bacteria and hybridization in plants. Although there is continuous variation through these processes, most species genomes are identical in all individuals of that species. However, even small changes in the genotype can result in dramatic changes in the phenotype. For example, chimpanzees and humans differ by only 5% of their genomes. Genetic variation originates from random mutations that occur in the genomes of organisms. Mutations are changes to the DNA sequence of the cell genome and are caused by radiation, viruses, transposons, mutagenic chemicals, and errors during meiosis or DNA replication. These mutagens produce several types of changes to the DNA sequence. This can result in changes in gene product, preventing the gene from functioning, or producing no effect at all. Studies in the fly Drosophila melanogaster show that if a mutation changes the protein produced by a gene, 70% of these mutations have an adverse effect and the rest are neutral or slightly beneficial. Because of the detrimental effects of mutations on cells, organisms have DNA repair mechanisms to eliminate mutations.",

        "paragraph": "Therefore, the optimal mutation rate for a species is a compromise of the cost of high mutation rate which is detrimental, at the cost of metabolic systems reducing the mutation rate, such as DNA repair enzymes. Some species, such as retroviruses, have high mutation rates, such that their offspring will have the mutated gene. Such fast mutations were chosen so that this virus can constantly and rapidly evolve, so as to avoid the response of the human immune system. Mutations can involve the duplication of large DNA fragments, which are the main source of raw materials for new genes to evolve, with tens to hundreds of genes being duplicated in animal genomes every million years. Most genes are part of a larger common ancestral gene family. Genes are produced by several methods, generally through duplication and mutation of ancestral genes or by recombining different parts of the gene, forming new combinations with new functions. For example, the human eye uses four genes to produce light-sensing structures: three for cone cells, and one for rod cells; all derived from a single ancestral gene. The advantage of duplicating a gene (or even an entire genome) is that overlapping or overfunctioning of multiple genes allows alleles to be maintained (if not harmful), thereby increasing genetic diversity. Changes in chromosome number can involve even larger mutations, with DNA segments in chromosomes breaking off and then rearranging. For example, two chromosomes in the genus Homo combine to form human chromosome 2; this union did not occur in the other ape lineages, and was maintained as two separate chromosomes. The most important role of this chromosomal rearrangement in evolution is likely to have been to hasten population divergence into new species by keeping populations from breeding with each other, thus maintaining the genetic differences between these populations.",

        "paragraph": "DNA sequences that can move within the genome, such as transposons, are a major part of the genetic material of plants and animals, and can play an important role in the evolution of genomes. For example, more than one million copies of Alu sequences are present in the human genome, and these sequences have been used to carry out functions such as regulation of gene expression. Another effect of this mobile DNA sequence is that when it moves within a genome, it can mutate or delete existing genes, resulting in genetic diversity. In asexual organisms, genes are inherited together, or linked, because they cannot mix with the genes of other organisms during reproduction. The offspring of sexual organisms contain a random mixture of ancestral chromosomes produced by independent sorting. In a related genetic recombination process, sexual organisms can also exchange DNA between two matching chromosomes. Recombination and resorting do not change allele frequencies, but do change which alleles are associated with each other, producing offspring with new combinations of alleles. While this process increases variation in any individual's offspring, genetic mixing can be predicted to produce no effect, increase, or decrease genetic variation in the population, depending on how the allele variety in the population is distributed. For example, if two alleles are randomly distributed in a population, then sex will have no effect on variation. However, if two alleles tend to be found as a pair, then genetic mixing balances this non-random distribution, and over time makes organisms in the population more similar to one another. The overall effect of sex on natural variation is unclear, but recent research has shown that sex usually increases genetic variation and can increase the rate of evolution.",

        "paragraph": "Recombination allows the same alleles that are adjacent to each other on a strand of DNA to be inherited independently. But the recombination rate is low, because in a human with a million base pair DNA fragment, there is a one in a hundred chance of a recombination event occurring per generation. As a result, genes that are close together on chromosomes are not always rearranged away from each other, and so they tend to be inherited together. This trend is measured by finding how often two different alleles of a gene are found together, which is known as linkage disequilibrium. A set of alleles that are usually inherited together as a group is referred to as a haplotype. Sexual reproduction helps eliminate harmful mutations and maintains beneficial mutations. Consequently, when alleles cannot be separated by recombination (eg the mammalian Y chromosome passed from father to son), harmful mutations accumulate. In addition, recombination and re-sorting can produce individuals with new and advantageous combinations of genes. These positive effects are balanced by the fact that this process can lead to mutations and segregation of favorable gene combinations. From a genetic standpoint, evolution is the change in allele frequencies in populations that share a gene pool from one generation to another. A population is a localized group of individuals that are of the same species. For example, all moths of the same species living in an isolated forest represent a population. A single gene in this population can have alternative forms that are responsible for the variation between phenotypes of organisms. An example is the gene responsible for moth color having two alleles: black and white. The gene pool is the entire set of alleles in a single population, so that each allele appears in the gene pool multiple times.",

        "paragraph": "The fraction of a gene in the gene pool that is a particular allele is referred to as the allele frequency. Evolution occurs when there is a change in allele frequencies in a population of organisms that reproduce with each other; for example the allele for black in moth populations is becoming more common. To understand the mechanisms by which a population evolves, it is useful to consider what conditions a population requires not to evolve. The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that allele frequencies (variation in a gene) in a sufficiently large population will remain constant if the only driving force present in the population is the random rearrangement of alleles during sperm or egg formation and the random combination of these sex cell alleles. during fertilization. Such a population is said to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and not evolving. Gene flow is the exchange of genes between populations, which are usually of the same species. Examples of gene flow within a species include the migration and reproduction of organisms or the exchange of pollen. Gene transfer between species includes the formation of hybrid organisms and horizontal gene transfer. Migration into or out of a population can change allele frequencies, as well as add genetic variation to a population. Immigration can add new genetic material to the existing gene pool of a population. Conversely, emigration can remove genetic material. Because a reproductive split between two divergent populations is necessary for speciation to occur, gene flow can slow this process by spreading genetic differences between populations. Gene flow is blocked by mountain ranges, oceans, and deserts. Even human structures like the Great Wall of China can block the flow of plant genes. Depending on the degree to which two species have diverged since their most recent common ancestor, it is possible for both species to produce offspring, as in horses and donkeys whose mixed mating results in mules.",

        "paragraph": "These hybrids are usually sterile, because two different sets of chromosomes cannot pair up during meiosis. In this case, closely related species may regularly interbreed, but the resulting hybrid will sort out, and the two species will still be distinct. However, capable of reproducing hybrids are sometimes formed, and the new species can have traits between the two ancestral species or an entirely new phenotype. The importance of hybridization in the formation of new animal species is unclear, although cases have been found in many animal species, the Hyla versicolor being a well-studied example. Hybridization is an important speciation mode in plants, because polyploidy (having more than two copies of each chromosome) is better tolerated in plants than in animals. Polyploidy is very important in hybrids because it allows reproduction, with two different sets of chromosomes, each chromosome can pair with its identical partner during meiosis. Polyploids also have more genetic diversity, which allows them to avoid inbreeding depression in small populations. Horizontal gene transfer is the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another that is not its offspring. It is most common in bacteria. In medicine, this is contributing to antibiotic resistance. When one bacterium acquires a resistance gene, it quickly transfers it to other species. Horizontal gene transfer from bacteria to eukaryotes such as the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the beetle Callosobruchus chinensis can also occur. An example of transfer on a large scale is in the eukaryote bdelloid rotifers, which appear to have received genes from bacteria, fungi, and plants.

        "paragraph": "Large-scale gene transfer has also occurred between prokaryotes and eukaryotic cells during the acquisition of chloroplasts and mitochondria. The main mechanisms for producing evolutionary change are natural selection and genetic drift. Natural selection favored genes that increased the capacity for survival and reproduction. Genetic drift is a random change in allele frequency, caused by random sampling of generations of genes during reproduction. Gene flow is the transfer of genes within and between populations. The relative importance of natural selection and genetic drift in a population varies, depending on the strength of selection and the effective population size, which is the number of individuals capable of reproducing. Natural selection usually dominates in large populations, while genetic drift predominates in small populations. The dominance of genetic drift in even a small population can lead to the fixation of mutations that are slightly detrimental. Hence, changing the population size can dramatically affect the direction of evolution. The population bottleneck, where the population shrinks temporarily and loses genetic variation, results in a more uniform population. Bottlenecks are caused by changes in gene flow, such as decreased migration, expansion to new habitats, or population subdivision. Natural selection is the process by which genetic mutations that enhance the survival and reproduction of an organism become (and remain) more common from one generation to another in a population. It is often called a \"self-evident\" mechanism because: These conditions result in competition between organisms for survival and reproduction. Therefore, organisms with more favorable traits are more likely to pass on their traits, while those that are unfavorable tend not to be passed on to the next generation. The central concept of natural selection is the evolutionary fitness of organisms.",

        "paragraph": "Evolutionary fitness measures the genetic contribution of an organism to the next generation. However, it is not the same as the total number of offspring, rather fitness measures the proportion of that generation carrying an organism's genes. Therefore, if an allele increases fitness more than the other alleles, then with each generation, that allele becomes more common in the population. Examples of traits that can increase fitness are survival and fecundity enhancement. In contrast, lower fitness caused by less favorable or detrimental alleles results in these alleles being more rare. It is important to note that the fitness of an allele is not a fixed characteristic. If the environment changes, properties that were previously neutral or detrimental can become beneficial and those that were previously beneficial can become detrimental. Natural selection within a population for a trait whose value varies, for example height, can be categorized into three types. The first is directional selection, which is a shift in the average value of a trait over a certain time interval, for example organisms tend to get taller. The second, disruptive selection, is extreme value selection, and often results in two different values \u200b\u200bbecoming more common (by selecting out the average value). This occurs when both short and long organisms benefit, while those of medium height do not. Third, stabilizing selection, namely selection of extreme values, causes a decrease in variation around the average value. This can cause organisms to slowly become the same height. A special case of natural selection is sexual selection, which is selection for traits that increase mating success by increasing the attractiveness of an organism. Traits that have evolved through sexual selection are mainly present in the males of several animal species.",

        "paragraph": "Although this trait may reduce the male's survival (eg the large antlers and bright color can attract predators), this survival disadvantage is balanced by the higher reproductive success of the male. An active area of \u200b\u200bresearch in evolutionary biology today is the unit of selection, with natural selection proposed to work at the level of genes, cells, individual organisms, groups of organisms, and even species. Neither of these models is exclusive, and selection can work on several levels simultaneously. Below the individual level, genes called transposons attempt to copy themselves throughout the genome. Selection at a level beyond the individual, such as group selection, can allow for the evolution of co-operation. Genetic drift or genetic drift is a change in allele frequency from one generation to the next that occurs because alleles in an offspring are a random sample from their parents; besides that it also occurs because of the role of probability in determining whether an individual will survive and reproduce or not. In mathematical terms, alleles have the potential for sampling error. Hence, when the selective drive is absent or relatively weak, allele frequencies tend to \"drift\" up or down randomly (random walk). This drift stops when an allele eventually becomes fixed, either by disappearing from the population, or by displacing all the other alleles. Genetic drift can therefore eliminate some alleles from a population simply by chance. Even in the absence of selective forces, genetic drift can cause two separate populations with the same genetic structure to drift into two diverging populations with different sets of alleles. The time for an allele to become fixed by genetic drift depends on population size, with fixation occurring more rapidly in smaller populations.",

        "paragraph": "An appropriate measure of population is the effective population size, defined by Sewall Wright as the theoretical number representing the number of breeding individuals that will show the same observed degree of reproduction. Although natural selection is responsible for adaptation, the relative importance of natural selection and genetic drift in driving evolutionary change is generally a research area in evolutionary biology. This investigation is suggested by the neutral molecular theory of evolution, which proposes that most evolutionary changes result from fixation of neutral mutations that have no instantaneous effect on the fitness of an organism. Thus, in this model, most genetic change in a population is the result of constant mutation pressure and genetic drift. Evolution affects every aspect of the form and behavior of organisms. The most visible are the behavioral and physical adaptations brought about by natural selection. These adaptations increase fitness by assisting in activities such as finding food, avoiding predators, and attracting members of the opposite sex. Organisms can also respond to selection by cooperating with one another, usually by helping each other in symbiosis. Over long periods of time, evolution produces new species by splitting ancestral populations of organisms into new groups that will not interbreed. The consequences of evolution are sometimes divided into macroevolution and microevolution. Macroevolution is evolution that occurs at levels above species, such as extinction and speciation. Meanwhile, microevolution is small evolutionary changes, such as adaptations that occur within a species or population. In general, macroevolution is considered to be a long-term result of microevolution. So the difference between microevolution and macroevolution is not so much apart from the time involved in the process. However, in macroevolution, the properties of the whole species are important. For example, large variations among individuals allow a species to quickly adapt to a new habitat, reducing the likelihood of extinction.",

        "paragraph": "Meanwhile, a wide geographic range increases the likelihood of speciation by isolating some populations. In this sense, microevolution and macroevolution can involve selection at different levels, with microevolution acting on genes and organisms, versus macroevolution acting on entire species and affecting rates of speciation and extinction. There is a misconception that evolution is \"progressive,\" but that natural selection has no long-term purpose and need not produce greater complexity. Although complex species developed out of evolution, this occurred as a side effect of increasing numbers of organisms, and simple life forms remained more common. For example, the vast majority of species are microscopic prokaryotes that make up half the world's biomass despite their small size, and constitute the majority of the Earth's biodiversity. Simple organisms were therefore the dominant life forms on earth in its history until now. Complex life seems more diverse because it is easier to observe. Adaptations are structures or behaviors that enhance the function of certain organs, causing organisms to become better able to survive and reproduce. It results from a combination of continuous, small-scale random changes in the properties of organisms followed by natural selection of the variants best suited to their environment. This process can cause the addition of new features or the loss of ancestral characteristics. An example is the adaptation of bacteria to antibiotic selection through genetic changes that cause antibiotic resistance. This can be achieved by changing the target of the drug or increasing the activity of transporters that pump the drug out of the cell. Other examples are the Escherichia coli bacteria which evolved the ability to use citric acid as a nutrient in a long-term laboratory experiment, or the Flavobacterium which managed to produce enzymes that allow these bacteria to grow in nylon production waste.",

        "paragraph": "However, many traits that appear to be simple adaptations are actually exaptations, that is, structures that are initially adapted for a particular function but coincidentally assume other functions in the process of evolution. An example is the African gecko Holaspis guentheri which developed a very flattened head for hiding in crevices, as seen in close relatives of this species. In this species, however, the head becomes very flat, which helps the species glide from tree to tree. Another example is the use of enzymes from glycolysis and xenobiotic metabolism as structural proteins called crystallin (crystallin) in the eye lens of organisms. While adaptation occurs through gradual modification of existing structures, structures with internal organization can have very different functions in the organisms to which they relate. This is a result of the ancestral structure being adapted to function in a different way. The bones in the wings of bats, for example, are structurally the same as those of the human hand and the flippers of seals because of a common ancestral structure with five fingers. Another idiosyncratic anatomical feature is the bone on the panda's wrist forming a false \"thumb,\" indicating that an organism's evolutionary lineage can limit what adaptations are possible. During adaptation, some structures may lose their original function and become vestigial structures. These structures may have little or no function in the present species, but have a clear function in ancestral species or other closely related species. Examples include pseudogenes, non-functioning eye remnants in blind cavefish, wings in flightless birds, and the presence of hip bones in whales and snakes.",

A current field of investigation in evolutionary developmental biology is development based on adaptation and adaptation. This research addresses the origin and evolution of embryonic development, and how these developmental modifications and developmental processes lead to new traits. Studies in this field show that evolution can change development and produce new structures, such as the embryonic bone structure that develops into the jaw in some animals rather than the middle ear in mammals. It is possible for structures that have been lost during the evolutionary process to reappear due to changes in developmental genes, such as a mutation in chickens that causes teeth similar to those of crocodiles. It is becoming increasingly clear that most changes in the form of organisms result from changes in the level and timing of expression of a small set of conserved genes. Interactions between organisms can produce both conflict and co-operation. When interacting between pairs of species, such as a pathogen and a host or a predator and its prey, these species develop a corresponding set of adaptations. In this case, the evolution of one species causes the adaptation of the second. Changes in the second species then cause a return to adaptation of the first species. This cycle of selection and response is known as coevolution. Examples are the production of tetrodotoxin in the newt Taricha granulosa and the evolution of tetrodotoxin resistance in its predator, the snake Thamnophis sirtalis. In these predator-prey pairs, this evolutionary arms competition results in high levels of poison in the prey and high poison resistance in the predator. However, not all interactions between species involve conflict. In most cases, mutually beneficial interactions develop. For example, the extreme cooperation that exists between plants and mycorrhizal fungi that grow on plant roots and help plants absorb nutrients from the soil.",

In this case, the fungus is actually growing inside the plant cell, allowing it to exchange nutrients with the host while sending signals that suppress the plant's immune system. Coalitions between organisms of the same species also develop. An extreme case is the eusociality found in social insects, such as bees, termites, and ants, in which sterile insects feed and maintain a number of organisms in a colony that can reproduce. On a smaller scale the somatic cells that make up an animal's body limit its reproduction in order to maintain a stable organism, which can then support a small number of animal germ cells to produce offspring. In this case, somatic cells respond to certain signals that instruct them to grow or die. If cells ignore these signals and then multiply, this uncontrolled growth will lead to cancer. Cooperation within species is thought to have developed through a process of kin selection, in which one organism plays the role of nurturing the offspring of its kin. This activity is selected because if the \"helping\" individual contains an allele that promotes the helping activity, it is possible that its relatives \"also\" contain this allele, and so the alleles will be inherited. Other processes that promote cooperation include group selection, in which cooperation confers an advantage on the group of organisms. Speciation is the process by which a species diverges into two or more species. It has been observed many times under controlled laboratory conditions as well as in the wild. In organisms that reproduce sexually, speciation results from reproductive isolation followed by genealogical divergence. There are four speciation mechanisms. The most common occurrence in animals is allopatric speciation, which occurs in populations that were initially isolated geographically, for example through habitat fragmentation or migration.",

        "paragraph": "Selection under such conditions can produce very rapid changes in the appearance and behavior of organisms. Because selection and drift operate independently of isolated populations, segregation will eventually result in organisms that will not be able to interbreed. The second mechanism of speciation is peripatric speciation, which occurs when a small population of organisms becomes isolated in a new environment. It differs from allopatric speciation in that the population size is smaller than the parent population. In this case, the founder effect causes rapid speciation through rapid genetic drift and selection over a small gene pool. The third mechanism of speciation is parapatric speciation. It is similar to peripatric speciation in that the small population size enters a new habitat, but differs in that there is no physical separation between the two populations. This speciation results from the evolution of mechanisms that reduce the flow of genetics between two populations. In general, this occurs when there is a drastic change in the habitat of the parent species. One example is the grass Anthoxanthum odoratum, which can undergo parapatric speciation in response to localized metal pollution from mining. In this case, the plant evolved resistance to high metal levels in the soil. Outselection for interbreeding with parental populations results in changes in flowering time, leading to reproductive isolation. Out-selection for hybrids between two populations can lead to \"hardening\", which is the evolution of traits that promote mating within a species, as well as character switching, which occurs when two species become more different in appearance. A fourth mechanism of speciation is sympatric speciation, in which species diverge without geographic isolation or changes to habitat. This mechanism is quite rare because only a small amount of gene flow eliminates genetic differences between one part of the population and another.",

One type of sympatric speciation involves cross-breeding of two related species to produce a hybrid species. This is not common in animals because hybrids are usually infertile. In contrast, cross-breeding generally occurs in plants, as plants often double their chromosome number, forming polyploids. This allows the chromosomes of each parental species to form matching pairs during meiosis. An example of this speciation event is when the Arabidopsis thaliana and Arabidopsis arenosa plants interbreed to produce a new species, Arabidopsis suecica. This occurred approximately 20,000 years ago, and this speciation process has been repeated in the laboratory, allowing the study of the genetic mechanisms involved in this process. In fact, the doubling of chromosomes within a species is a major cause of reproductive isolation, because the half of the doubled chromosomes will be mismatched when mating with an organism with no doubled chromosomes. Extinction is the loss of an entire species. End is not an uncommon event, as species regularly appear through speciation and disappear through extinction. In fact, nearly all species of animals and plants that have ever lived on earth are extinct, and extinction seems to be the ultimate fate of all species. Extinctions have occurred continuously throughout the history of life, although the rate of extinction has occasionally increased sharply during mass extinction events. The Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction event is one of the best-known examples of a mass extinction, in which the dinosaurs became extinct. But the earlier event, the Permian\u2013Triassic extinction event, was more severe, with about 96 percent of species going extinct. The Holocene extinction event was the mass extinction associated with the expansion of humans across the Earth over several thousand years.",

Human activities are now the main cause of this ongoing extinction event. In addition, global warming could accelerate the rate of extinction further. The role of extinction in evolution depends on the type of extinction. The cause of the persistent \"low-level\" extinction events (which account for the majority of extinction cases) is unclear and may be the result of competition between species for limited resources (the principle of competition avoidance). If competition from other species changes the probability of a species becoming extinct, this can result in species selection as a level of natural selection. Mass extinction events were also important, but instead of acting as a selective force, they drastically reduced diversity and drove sudden rapid evolution and speciation in creatures that survived extinction. The origin of life is a precursor to biological evolution, but understanding the evolution that occurred once organisms appeared and investigating how this happened is independent of understanding how life began. The current scientific consensus is that the complex biochemical compounds that make up life arose from simpler chemical reactions. But it is not yet clear how this happened. It is not certain what the earliest life developments, the first life structures were, or the identities and characteristics of the last universal ancestor and ancestral gene pool. Therefore, there is no definitive scientific consensus on how life began, but there are several proposals involving self-replicating molecules (eg RNA) and simple cell assembly.

The common ancestor of organisms was first deduced from four simple facts about organisms. First, that organisms have geographic distributions that cannot be explained by local adaptations. Second, the form of biodiversity is not in the form of organisms that are completely different from each other, but in the form of organisms that have morphological similarities to one another. Third, vestigial traits with unclear functions are similar to ancestral traits with clear functions. Finally, organisms can be classified based on this similarity into hierarchical groups. Past species also left records of their evolutionary history. Fossils, along with comparable anatomy to present-day organisms, constitute the morphological and anatomical record. By comparing the anatomy of an extinct species with that of a modern one, paleontologists can draw a lineage for that species. But this approach only works in organisms that have hard body parts, such as shells, skeletons, or teeth. Furthermore, because prokaryotes such as bacteria and archaea share only limited morphological similarities, prokaryote fossils do not provide information about their ancestry. More recently, evidence of common ancestry has come from studies of biochemical similarities between species. For example, all living cells in this world have the same basic set of nucleotides and amino acids. The development of molecular genetics has uncovered the evolutionary records left in the genomes of organisms, so that it can be known when species diverged through the molecular clocks generated by mutations. For example, comparison of these DNA sequences has revealed a genetic relationship between humans and chimpanzees and when a common ancestor of the two species existed.",

No major changes in cell morphology or organization occurred in these organisms over the next several billion years. Eukaryotes are a major development in cell evolution. It originates from ancient bacteria that were engulfed by ancestral prokaryotic cells in a cooperative association called endosymbiosis. The engulfed bacteria and host cells then undergo coevolution, with the bacteria evolving into either mitochondria or hydrogenosomes. Separate second ingestion of organisms similar to cyanobacteria results in the formation of chloroplasts in algae and plants. It is not known when the first eukaryotic cells appeared, although they appeared around 1.6 - 2.7 billion years ago. The history of life was still single-celled eukaryotes, prokaryotes, and archaea until about 610 billion years ago, when multicellular organisms began to appear in the oceans in the Ediacaran period. The evolution of multicellularity occurred at many separate events, occurring in organisms as diverse as sponges, brown algae, cyanobacteria, slime molds, and myxobacteria. Immediately after the appearance of multicellular organisms, a great deal of biological diversity appeared over a period of about 10 million years in an event known as the Cambrian explosion. At this time, the majority of modern animal species appear in the fossil record, as well as lineages of animals that have become extinct. Several factors driving the Cambrian explosion have been proposed, including the accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere from photosynthesis. About 500 million years ago, plants and fungi colonized the land, and were soon followed by arthropods and other animals. Amphibians first appeared about 300 million years ago, followed by amniotes, then mammals about 200 million years ago, and aves about 100 million years ago.",

However, this controversy generally revolves around the implications of the theory of evolution in the philosophical, social, and religious fields. Within the scientific community, the fact that organisms evolve is widely accepted and not challenged. Nevertheless, evolution is still a concept debated by some religious groups. While various religious groups try to connect their teachings with the theory of evolution through various theistic concepts of evolution, there are many supporters of creationism who believe that evolution contradicts the creation myth found in their religious teachings. As Darwin had already predicted, the most controversial implication is human origins. In several countries, most notably in the United States, the conflict between religion and science has given rise to the creation-evolution controversy, a religious conflict focused on politics and education. While other scientific fields such as cosmology and earth science also clash with the literal interpretations of many religious texts, evolutionary biology encounters even more significant opposition. Some examples of the unwarranted controversy associated with the theory of evolution are \"social Darwinism\", the term given to the theory of Malthusianism developed by Herbert Spencer regarding the survival of the fittest in society, and by others' claims that social inequality, racism, and imperialism is therefore justified.

The word God in Malay comes from the word Tuan. The first book that provides information about the relationship between the words master and God is the Popular Encyclopedia of the Church by Adolf Heuken SJ (1976). According to the book, the meaning of the word God has something to do with the Malay word Tuan which means superior/ruler/owner.

Pascal Boyer argues that in a world filled with different concepts about supernatural things, in general, these supernatural beings tend to act like humans. Depictions of gods and other supernatural beings as humans are an easily recognizable feature of a religion. Take, for example, Greek mythology, which he says tends to resemble today's soap operas rather than a belief system. Bertrand du Castel and Timothy Jurgensen demonstrated through formalization that Boyer's explanation fits with the epistemology of physics in positioning the observed entities as indirect intermediaries. Anthropologist Stewart Guthrie argues that society projects human traits onto non-human aspects of the world because doing so makes those aspects more familiar. Sigmund Freud also stated that the concept of divinity is a projection of a father figure for a person. \u00c9mile Durkheim was one of the first to suggest that gods represented the extension of human social life to include supernatural elements. Countering this statement, psychologist Matt Rossano argues that when humans began to live in larger groups, they created a god as the enforcement of morality. In smaller groups, morality can be maintained by social forces such as spreading gossip or maintaining goodwill. However, it is more difficult to maintain morality in large groups by using social force. Rossano states that by adding to the belief in gods and supernatural beings who are omniscient, humans find effective strategies for controlling selfishness and building more cooperative groups. Until 2000, around 53% of the world's population identified as adherents of one of the three largest divine religions (33% Christian, 20% Muslim, <1% Jewish), 6% Buddhist, 13% Hindu, 6% adherents of traditional Chinese beliefs, 7% adhere to other religions, and less than 15% claim no religion.",

It is thought that the primordial nucleons themselves formed from the quark-gluon plasma from the Big Bang when it cooled below two trillion Kelvin. Minutes later, starting with just protons and neutrons, nuclei from aton down to lithium and beryllium (both mass number 7) formed, but only in relatively small numbers. Then the fusion process essentially stops as the temperature and density decrease, as the universe continues to expand. This first primordial nucleosynthesis process can also be referred to as nucleogenesis. Subsequent nucleosynthesis of the heavier elements required the explosion of heavy stars and supernovae. This happened theoretically because hydrogen and helium from the Big Bang (perhaps influenced by the concentration of dark matter), condensed into prime stars 500 million years after the Big Bang. The elements formed in stellar nucleosynthesis range in atomic numbers from 6 (carbon) to at least 98 (californium), which have been detected from the spectra of some supernovae. The synthesis of these heavier elements occurs as a result of either nuclear fission (including multiple slow and fast neutron capture) or nuclear fission, sometimes followed by beta decay. In contrast, many stellar processes actually tend toward the breakdown of deuterium and the isotopes of beryllium, lithium, and boron that were present in stars, after their primordial formation at the time of the Big Bang. The quantities of these lighter elements present in the present-day universe were then thought to have formed primarily through billions of years of cosmic rays (mainly high-energy protons) that mediated the breakup of the heavier elements present in interstellar dust and gas. The first notion of nucleosynthesis was that the chemical elements were created at the beginning of the universe, but no physics storyline succeeded in explaining this.",

At the same time, it is clear that carbon is the next most abundant element, and there is also a general trend towards abundance of the light elements, especially those consisting of all the atomic number helium-4 nuclei. Arthur Stanley Eddington was the first to suggest in the 1920s that stars obtain energy by fusing hydrogen to form helium, but this idea was not generally accepted because of the flawed nuclear mechanism. Immediately a few years later, just before World War II, Hans Bethe was the first to provide the necessary nuclear mechanism, in which hydrogen fused to form helium. However, these two early works on star power were unable to explain the origin of elements heavier than helium. Fred Hoyle's original work on the nucleosynthesis of heavier elements in stars appeared after World War II. This work involved the creation of all the heavy elements in stars during the process of nuclear evolution of their composition, starting from hydrogen. Hoyle proposed that hydrogen was created continuously in the universe from vacuum and energy, without the need for a starting universe. Hoyle's work explains how the abundance of elements increases as galaxies age. In turn, Hoyle's picture was expanded in the 1960s by the creative contributions of William A. Fowler, Alastair G. W. Cameron, and Donald D. Clayton, and later by others. The creative 1957 review paper by Margaret Burbidge, Geoffrey Burbidge, Fowler, and Hoyle (see list of References) is a famous overview of the state of this branch of science in 1957.",

The Big Bang itself was proposed in 1931, long before this period, by Georges Lema\u00eetre, a Belgian physicist and Roman Catholic priest, who suggested that the universe expanding as time moves forward means that the universe also contracts as time moves backwards, and will continue doing so until the universe could contract no more, driving all the mass of the universe into a single point, the \"primeval atom\", at a point in time before space and time ceased to exist. Hoyle later gives the Lema\u00eetre model, a derogatory term for the Big Bang, not suggesting that Lema\u00eetre's model is necessary to explain the existence of deuterium and the nuclides between helium and carbon, as well as the substantially large amount of helium that exists not only in stars, but also in stars. in interstellar gas. When that happens, Lema\u00eetre's and Hoyle's models of nucleosynthesis are surely needed to explain the abundance of elements in the universe. In modern theory, there are a number of astrophysical processes believed to be responsible for nucleosynthesis in the universe. Most of it occurs in hot matter inside stars. The successive processes of nuclear fusion that occur inside stars are known as hydrogen burning (through the proton-proton chain reaction or the CNO cycle), helium fusion, carbon burning, neon burning, oxygen burning, and silicon burning. These processes are capable of producing elements down to iron and nickel, the region of these isotopes having the highest binding energy per nucleus. Heavier elements can be assembled inside stars by an electron capture process called the s process or in explosive environments, such as supernovae, by a number of processes.",

Big Bang nucleosynthesis occurred in the first three minutes of the creation of the universe and is responsible for much of the abundance ratio of 1H (protium), 2H (deuterium), 3He (helium-3), and 4He (helium-4), in the universe. Although 4He continues to be produced by other mechanisms (such as stellar fusion and alpha decay) and trace amounts of 1H continue to be produced by spallation and special types of radioactive decay (proton and neutron release), most of the mass of these isotopes in the universe is , and all but the insignificant traces of 3He and deuterium in the universe produced by rare processes such as cluster decay, are thought to have resulted in the Big Bang process. The atomic nuclei of these elements, along with 7Li, and 7Be are believed to have formed when the universe was 100 to 300 seconds old, after the primordial quark-gluon plasma congealed to form protons and neutrons. Because the Big Bang's nucleosynthetic period was so short before it was stopped by expansion and cooling, no elements heavier than lithium could be formed. (The elements formed at this time were in the plasma state, and did not cool to the state of neutral atoms for a long time.) Stellar nucleosynthesis occurs in stars during the process of stellar evolution. Stellar nucleosynthesis is responsible for the creation of elements from carbon to iron through the process of nuclear fusion. Stars are nuclear furnaces in which H and He diffuse into heavier atomic nuclei, a process that occurs by chains of protons in stars cooler than the sun, and by the CNO cycle in stars more massive than the sun. .",

Carbon is also the main element used in the production of free neutrons in stars, giving rise to the s process which involves the slow absorption of neutrons to produce elements heavier than iron and nickel (57Fe and 62Ni). Carbon and other elements formed by this process are also very basic for life. The products of stellar nucleosynthesis are generally dispersed into the universe through episodes of mass loss and stellar winds in small-mass stars, such as in the evolutionary phase of planetary nebulae, as well as through explosive events produced in supernovas in the case of massive stars. The first direct evidence that nucleosynthesis arose in stars was the detection of technetium in the atmospheres of red giants in the early 1950s, prototypes for the technetium class of stars. Because technetium is radioactive, with a half-life much shorter than the age of the star, its abundance must reflect its creation within the star during its lifetime. Less dramatic, but equally convincing evidence is the overwhelming abundance of certain stable elements in the atmospheres of stars. An important historical case is the observation of an abundance of barium approximately 20-50 times more than that in a non-expanding star, i.e. evidence for an s-process in the star. Much modern evidence emerges in the isotopic composition of star dust, the dense grains that have condensed from the gases of individual stars and which have been extracted from meteorites. Star dust is a component of cosmic dust. The measured isotopic composition exhibits many aspects of nucleosynthesis in stars, from which stellar dust grains condense.",

In the explosive environment of the supernova, elements between silicon and nickel are synthesized by rapid fusion. Also within a supernova, advanced processes of nucleosynthesis can occur, such as the r process, in which the most neutron-rich isotopes of elements heavier than nickel are produced by the rapid absorption of the free neutrons released during the explosion. This occurrence is responsible for the naturally occurring clusters of radioactive elements, such as uranium and thorium, as well as the most neutron-rich isotopes of the heavy elements. The rp process involves the rapid absorption of free protons as well as neutrons, but their role is less certain. Explosive nucleosynthesis occurs too quickly for radioactive decay to increase the number of neutrons, so there are many isotope abundances that equal the number of protons and neutrons synthesized by the alpha process to produce nuclides containing the entire number of helium atomic nuclei, up to 16 (representing 64Ge). The nuclides are stable down to 40Ca (made of 10 helium atomic nuclei), but heavier nuclei with the same number of protons and neutrons are radioactive. However, the alpha process continued to influence the creation of isobars of these nuclides, at least including the radioactive nuclides 44Ti, 48Cr, 52Fe, 56Ni, 60Zn, and 64Ge, most of which (preserving 44Ti and 60Zn) were created in abundance because decays after the explosion to create the most abundant stable isotopes of the corresponding elements at each atomic weight. Thus, the most common (abundant) equivalent isotopes of the elements produced in this way are 48Ti, 52Cr, 56Fe, and 64Zn.",

The gamma ray lines recognized 56Co and 57Co, whose radioactive half-lives were one year, proving that 56Fe and 57Fe were produced by radioactive parents. This nuclear astronomy was suspected in 1969 as a way of confirming explosive nucleosynthesis in elements, and the assumption played an important role in the planning for NASA's Compton Gamma-ray Observatory. Other evidence of explosive nucleosynthesis is found in grains of stellar dust that condense in the interior of supernovas as they expand and cool. Field dust grains are a component of cosmic dust. In particular, radioactive 44Ti was measured to be highly abundant in supernova dust grains at the time the supernova condensed as the supernova continued to expand, confirming a 1975 conjecture to identify supernova star dust. Comparison of other unusual isotopes within these grains uncovers many special aspects of explosive nucleosynthesis. Cosmic ray spallation produces some of the lightest elements present in the universe (though not significant deuterium). It is commonly known that spallation is believed to be responsible for the production of nearly all 3He and the elements lithium, beryllium, and boron (some lithium-7 and beryllium-7 are thought to have been produced during the Big Bang). The spallation process results from the impact of cosmic rays (mainly fast protons) against the interstellar medium.

Some, like Hans Hetz, who annoyed H\u00fcbmaier at Nickelsburg, proclaimed that the Lord's day was near, and the saints were a chosen people who, like the descendants of Israel who conquered Palestine, served to weed out the wicked before the reign of Christ was established. above the earth. Michael Sattler, a former monk who, after being flayed and cut out his tongue, was burned in May 1527, earlier, in February of that year, had presided over the writing of the creed (article) of the Anabaptist faith. The Creed regards the Church as a union of local units of people who have been baptized as believers. Each local unit elects its own leader and is united by a Holy Communion.",

But not all Anabaptists professed this creed. Thus, this movement is referred to as a radicalism movement which endangered the church order that had developed at that time. Roman Catholic, Lutheran, and Zwinglian leaders considered the Anabaptists to be dangerous radicals, threatening anarchy in church and state. Among the three there were some who tried to get rid of them by force. In the late 1520's and early 1530's, hundreds of Anabaptists were killed, some by drowning, some by decapitation, and others by burning. Persecution of Anabaptists increased as they were believed to be partially responsible in the peasant uprising of 1524-1525. The accusation has good reasons. Thomas M\u00fcntzer was one of the masterminds behind the uprising in Saxony. He is usually categorized as an Anabaptist, because although he did not concern himself with it as much as the other Anabaptists, he rejected infant baptism, and by definition of Anabaptist inclusively he could be grouped with them. Certainly those who had misgivings about public order felt the need to act more ruthlessly against the Anabaptists for fear that, seeing that most of them belonged to a disadvantaged class, they might raise an uprising. The Anabaptist critics' greatest fears were realized in the M\u00fcnster episode of 1533-1535. M\u00fcnster, a city in Wesphalia, not far from the Dutch border, in the Middle Ages was a prominent member of the Hanseatic League, was the seat of a bishop. There in 1529 a young chaplain named Bernhard Rothmann began preaching on justification by faith. He succeeded in convincing many of the masses who should have been dissatisfied under the exploitation of the ecclesiastical rulers.",

But Rothmann never looked like a Lutheran, he was closer to Anabaptist. By 1533 he had become convinced that infant baptism was wrong. Because he refused to baptize infants, local community leaders, all Lutherans, tried to remove him from office, but stopped because his fame far exceeded their powers. In a public disagreement with a Lutheran and a Roman Catholic, the city's population declared Rothmann the winner. Then word spread that M\u00fcnster had become Anabaptist and Melchior Hoffman's followers flocked to the city. Hoffmann had predicted that after his imprisonment and after his death he would return, in 1533, to be with Christ amidst the clouds in heaven, and the wicked would be judged, and the New Jerusalem would be founded in Strassburg. The year 1533 has passed and Hoffman is still in prison, and the end has not yet come. One notable immigrant was Jan Matthys, a baker from Haarlem, in the Netherlands, who believed himself to be a prophet and who believed that it was M\u00fcnster, not Strassburg, where the new Jerusalem where saints reigned was founded. The other person was Jan Beukelssen, a tailor from Leiden. The Anabaptists took control of M\u00fcnster and there they tried to create a Christian society according to their beliefs. The Bishop of M\u00fcnster laid siege to the city. With the help of the Lutherans and Catholics he took over the city (June 24, 1535). Matthys had died in an initial battle.

Reports abound of extreme measures taken by Anabaptist zealots during these months against private property rights, polygamy, and suppression of dissidents. As usual such reports grow the more they are told and the more they are told, and the farther they are from the truth. In fact, private property rights were not abolished, and although some of its leaders practiced polygamy, severe punishment awaited those who committed adultery and who had intercourse outside of wedlock. Although only a minority of Anabaptists were involved, mainly from the group associated with Hoffmann, it was generally believed, especially among the ruling and other upper classes, that all Anabaptists wreaked havoc in government, society, morals, and religion. The bulk of the Anabaptists who survived persecution on the European continent were Mennonites. They got the name from Menno Simons. Menno Simons was born in the Lower Countries, was sent to school as a candidate for priesthood, possessed an in-depth knowledge of Latin and a little Greek, and was ordained a priest in 1524. At first he seemed no different from the other religious leaders of the period. that is generally materialistic. But an air of change began to blow, and even before he was ordained, Luther's name was already well known. Less than a year into his post, Menno Simons began to have doubts about the efficacy of the Mass. He began to study the Bible in depth when the execution of an Anabaptist in his native West Friesland shook him. While still serving as a priest in the Roman Catholic Church, he came to the conclusion that the church, and Luther, Zwingli, and Calvin had erred in administering infant baptism, and that only believer baptism has the authority of Scripture.",

January 30, 1536, he publicly broke with Roman Catholicism and shortly after was baptized by Obbe Phillips, an Anabaptist previously influenced by Hoffmann but who had no connection with the M\u00fcnster movement, an Anabaptist who was also shocked by claims from Matthys and others around him who claimed to have the gift of prophecy, and held fast to the Scriptures. Menno Simons knew that his move, by severing his connection with the world, would lead to persecution. Menno Simons' prediction of the persecution that would befall him finally came true. He was appointed an Anabaptist minister, sent as an itinerant missionary for the Anabaptist movement, and for many years lived in the Netherlands as a fugitive and wanted man on death row. However, he married and had children. In 1543 he extended his evangelizing efforts to Germany, almost always accompanied by persecution that threatened him from both the Roman Catholic and Lutheran sides. Eventually he found refuge in a manor house in Holstein, Denmark, impressed by the courage of the Anabaptists he had seen martyred, who believed them to be harmless people, and protected them. There Menno Simmons lived properly in his own house until the end of his life, but still made frequent trips to the Netherlands and Germany.

We know of creeds that date from 1577, 1579, 1582, 1591, 1600, and 1627. The Dortrecht Confession, 1632, was an attempt to unify the various forms of the movement and was widely used in Flemish (Flanders), Frisian, and Alsace congregations . The differences generally revolved around the degree of punishment that excommunicated church members received. Mennonites are deeply concerned about the high standard of living of Christianity and for this they enforce the penalty of ostracism for those deemed guilty in their community. The Anabaptists were constantly divided. The Mennonites are the most numerous, but even among them they are not united in a common alliance but differ among themselves. One branch, the Amish, which got its name from Jacob Ammann, from the late 17th century, attempted to return to a more disciplined life. The Hutterites, or Hutterite Brotherhood, of Jacob Hutter, who was tortured and burned in 1536, for generations practiced a community based on goods. Based in Moravia, they suffered badly in the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648). Their remnants sought refuge in Hungary. At the end of the 18th century many of them inhabited South Russia, who welcomed them for their tenacity and persistence.

Nucleotides are obtained from food and also synthesized in the liver from nutrients. Nucleotides are composed of three subunits, namely a heterocyclic nitrogenous base group (which is called a nucleotide base or nucleobase), a pentose sugar (which is either ribose or deoxyribose), and at least one phosphate group. The four types of nucleobases in DNA are guanine (G), adenine (A), cytosine (C), and thymine (T); in RNA, the nucleobase used is uracil (U) instead of thymine. Nucleotides play an important role in metabolism at the basic and cellular levels. Nucleotides contain chemical energy in the form of nucleotide triphosphates, namely adenosine triphosphate (ATP), guanosine triphosphate (GTP), cytidine triphosphate (CTG), and uridine triphosphate (UTP). These energy packages are distributed throughout the body's cells and provide energy for metabolic functions such as the synthesis of amino acids, proteins, cell membranes, and organelles; movement of cells and organelles (intracellular and extracellular); to cell division through mitosis and meiosis. In addition, the nucleotide participates in cell signaling via cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and is a subunit for several cofactors, such as CoA, FAD, FMN, NAD, and NADP\u207a. In cells, these cofactors play important roles in energy fixation (e.g. photosynthesis), metabolism, and cellular signal transduction. In experimental biochemistry, nucleotides can react with radionuclides to form radionucleotides. This process is called radiolabeling and is very important for exploring chemical reaction mechanisms.

In two adjacent nucleotide monomers, the phosphate group of one nucleotide is linked to the pentose sugar of the other nucleotide via carbon number 5 (called 5') by a covalent ester bond. This bond is called a phosphodiester bond. The bonds between one nucleotide and another form a long chain called a polynucleotide chain. This chain of combined sugar and phosphate molecules forms the strand as a 'backbone' in the form of a single or double twist. In one strand, the chemical orientation (direction) of the chain is said to be from the 5'-end to the 3'-end. This number refers to the five carbon sites in the sugar molecule in adjacent nucleotides. In a double twist, the two strands have opposite orientations. One chain has an orientation from 5' to 3', while the other chain has an orientation from 3' to 5'. This allows base pairs to be mutually complementary between them.

Some signaling nucleotides have different configurations of phosphate groups because they have multiple phosphate groups attached to different sites on the sugar. Nucleotide cofactors contain a wider range of chemical groups that are bonded to sugars via glycosidic bonds, including nicotinamide and flavin; in the case of flavin, the ribose sugar is more linear than the ring shape seen in other nucleotides. cAMP, a cyclic nucleotide that acts as a signaling molecule with a single phosphate attached to the 5- and 3- positions. pppGpp, a signaling molecule nucleotide with 5'- and 3'- phosphates.

Pyrimidine is synthesized first from aspartate and carbamoyl phosphate in the cytoplasm, forming the common ring precursor structure of orotic acid. The phosphorylated ribosyl group is then joined to the orotic acid structure, via covalent bonds. Purines are synthesized first from a sugar template where ring synthesis is carried out. Synthesis of pyrimidine and purine nucleotides is carried out by enzymes in the cytoplasm, not within specific organelles. The nucleotides are broken down and the useful parts can be reused in synthesis reactions to make new nucleotides. The synthesis of pyrimidine CTP and UTP takes place in the cytoplasm and begins with the formation of carbamoyl phosphate from glutamine and carbon dioxide. Next, the enzyme aspartate carbamoyl phosphate transferase catalyzes the condensation reaction between aspartate and carbamoyl phosphate to form aspartic carbamoyl acid, which is then cyclized to 4,5-acid dihydrotic with the help of the enzyme dihydroorotase. 4,5-dihydrotic acid is converted to orotate by the enzyme dihydroorotate oxidase. This reaction is: (S)-Dihydroorotate + O2 \u2192 Orotate + H2O2 Next, orotate is joined to a phosphorylated ribosyl group, via a covalent bond.

The atoms used to build purine nucleotides come from a variety of sources: The de novo synthesis for purine nucleotides is carried out with precursors inserted into the purine ring via a 10-step pathway to the IMP intermediate compound, the nucleotide from a hypoxanthine base. AMP and GMP are further synthesized from these intermediates via a two-step separate pathway. Therefore, the purine group is initially formed as part of a ribonucleotide, and not as a free base. Six enzymes are involved in the IMP synthesis reaction. Among the enzymes, three have multifunctional roles: The reaction pathway begins with the formation of PRPP. PRPS1 is an enzyme that activates R5P, which is formed by the pentose phosphate pathway, to PRPP which is made by reaction with ATP. This reaction is unusual because the pyrophosphoryl group is transferred directly from ATP to C1 from R5P, and the compound formed has an \u03b1 configuration at C1.

This is the committed step in purine synthesis. This reaction occurs by inverting the configuration at ribose C1, which then forms \u03b2-5-phosphoribosylamine (5-PRA) and confirms the anomeric form of the future nucleotide. Next, glycine is supplied with energy from ATP hydrolysis and the carboxyl group makes the amine bond with NH2 from before. The one-carbon unit of the folic acid coenzyme N10-formyl-THF is then added to the amine group of the substituted glycine, followed by closure of the imidazole ring. Then, the second NH2 group is transferred from the glutamine to the first carbon of the glycine group. The second one-carbon carboxylation unit of the glycine group is added together. This new carbon group is then modified by adding a third NH2 group, this time transferred from the aspartate residue. Finally, a second one-carbon unit of formyl THF is added to the nitrogen group and the ring is covalently closed to form the common purine precursor inosine monophosphate (IMP) group. Inosine monophosphate is converted to adenosine monophosphate in two steps. First, the hydrolysis of GTP provides the energy for adding aspartate to IMP by the enzyme adenylosuccinate synthase, replacing the carbonyl oxygen with nitrogen and forming the intermediate adenylosuccinate. Then, fumarate is cleaved to form adenosine monophosphate. This step is catalyzed by the enzyme adenylosuccinate lyase. Inosine monophosphate is converted to guanosine monophosphate through the oxidation reaction of IMP to form xantilate, followed by the insertion of an amine group at C2. NAD+ is the electron acceptor in this oxidation reaction. The transfer of amide groups is driven by energy from ATP hydrolysis.

Another note to mention the addition of approximately 4 cm per year and if the calculated then in a 25-year period the addition of Rakata's child's height has reached 190 meters (7,500 inches or 500 feet) higher than 25 years earlier. The cause of the high mountain was due to the material that came out of the belly of the new mountain. Currently, Anak Krakatau's height reaches about 230 meters above sea level, while Mount Krakatau previously had a height of 813 meters above sea level. According to Simon Winchester, even though what happened in the life of Krakatoa which used to be very frightening, the strange geological, seismic and tectonic realities in Java and Sumatra will ensure that what used to happen will one day happen again. No one knows for sure when Anak Krakatau will erupt. Some geologists predict this eruption will occur between 2015-2083. However, the influence of the earthquake at the bottom of the Indian Ocean on December 26, 2004 cannot be ignored either.",

This animal is very rare. Apart from being found only in areas where forests are still good, caecilians live in loose soil, near rivers or swamps; so it is rarely found by humans. In Javanese they are called ulo duwel. Caecilians have no legs at all, so the small species resemble worms and the large ones up to 1.5 m long resemble snakes. The tail is short or absent, and the cloaca is near the end of the body. The skin is soft, slimy, and matt dark in color, but some varieties are colorful. Inside the skin are scales of calcite. Because of these scales, the caecilians were once thought to be related to the fossil Stegocephalia, but this is now believed to be due to secondary development and the two groups cannot be related. The skin also has many ring-shaped folds, which partially cover the body so they appear segmented. Like other amphibians, there are glands in their skin that secrete poison to ward off predators. Siphonops paulensis skin secretions have been shown to be hemolytic. The anatomy of the caecilians is highly adapted for life in the soil. strong skull with a tapered snout to force its way through dirt or mud. n most species, the bones in the skull are reduced in number and fused together, and the mouth is recessed under the head. Their muscles are adapted to pushing their way through the ground, with the skeleton and deep muscles acting as a piston inside the skin and outer muscles. This allows the animal to anchor its hind end in position, and force the head forwards, and then pull up the rest of the body to reach it in waves. In very liquid water or mud, caecilians swim like eels. The caecilians of the family Typhlonectidae live in water and are also the largest of the caecilians.",

All but the most primitive caecilians have two sets of jaw-closing muscles of which there are a pair in other vertebrates. This is more highly developed in efficient land-dwelling caecilians, and apparently helps keep the skull and jaw rigid. Due to their underground life, caecilians' eyes are small and covered with protective skin which has led to the misconception that caecilians are blind. This is not necessarily true, although vision is limited to simple light-dark perception. All caecilians have a pair of tentacles which are located between the eyes and nostrils. these tentacles may be used for a second sense of smell, in addition to the normal sense of smell in its nose. With the exception of the lungless species Atretochoana eiselti which is known only from two specimens collected in South America, all caecilians possess lungs, but also use their skin and mouths, to absorb oxygen. Often the left lung is smaller than the right, an adaptation to body shape that is also found in snakes. Caecilians are found throughout most of the tropical regions of southeast Asia, Africa, the Seychelles islands and South America, except for dry areas and high mountains. In South America their range also extends to the cooler regions of northern Argentina. They can be found as far south as Buenos Aires, when they are carried by the floods of the Parana river farther north. There are no studies of them in central Africa, but caecilians may be present in the tropical forests there. The northernmost distribution is the species Ichthyophis sikkimensis in northern India. In Africa, caecilians are found from Guinea Bissau (Geotrypetes) to Northern Zambia (Scolecomorphus).

This is the Caudacaecilia clan which spreads in Kalimantan and Sumatra, and the Ichthyophis clan which is found in Kalimantan, Sumatra and Java. Caecilians are the only order of amphibians whose fertilization is internal. Male caecilians have a penis-like organ, called the phallodeum, which is inserted into the female's cloaca for 2 to 3 hours. About 25% of caecilian species are oviparous (egg-laying); the eggs are guarded by the female. In some species, caecilians are already metamorphosed at hatching; others hatch into larvae. The larvae do not live entirely in water, but spend most of their time on the ground near water. 75% of species are viviparous, meaning they give birth to fully developed young. The fetuses are fed inside the female's body from oviduct cells, which they feed on with special holding teeth. The egg-laying species Boulengerula taitanus feeds its young by developing an outer layer of skin rich in fat and nutrients that its young peel off with similar teeth. this allows them to grow ten times their weight in a week. The skin was eaten every three days, the time it took for a new layer to grow, and the young were observed to only eat at night. It was once thought that the young lived on the secretions of their mother. Some larvae, such as those of Typhlonectes, are born with large external gills which shed almost immediately. Ichthyophis lays eggs and is known to exhibit a nurturing nature with the mother watching over the eggs until they hatch. Caecilians like wet or damp places.

While it is thought that the indeterminate organic matter indicates that the caecilians were feeding on detritus, others believe these are the remains of earthworms. Its food consists of insects, worms and wire snakes (Typhlops). In captivity, caecilians will eat flies that are killed or paralyzed and sown into their cage. The name caecilia comes from the Latin caecus = blind, referring to its small or absent eyes. The name comes from the taxonomic name of the first species described by Carolus Linnaeus, which was named Caecilia tentaculata. The order's taxonomic name comes from the Greek \u03b3\u03c5\u03bc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 (gymnos, naked) and \u03bf\u03c6\u03b9\u03c2 (ophis, snake), because caecilians were originally thought to be relatives of snakes.

After the events of September 1965, a number of Indonesian authors who were stranded abroad and could not or were not allowed to return to their homeland, gave rise to a phenomenon known as Indonesian exile literature. The term exile in Indonesia does not only refer to exile in politics or literature. There are also 'socio-economic exiles', as experienced by Indonesian exiles (read: Javanese and Madurese) during the colonial period who had to work as laborers and administrative staff on large plantations in various countries, such as South Africa, Sri Rare, Suriname and New Caledonia. These narrative notes of socio-economic exiles from Indonesia were not written by exiles, and have not been explored by researchers, but as part of a long history of speech about people who were 'diselong' or 'thrown out', during the colonial period.

There are two other examples of political exile in Indonesian history, from a much younger historical scene, namely the entry of Islam into Java around the early 15th century. The Bedouin people and their culture and traditions in South Banten, which have closed themselves off to the outside world until now, are former members of the Tarumanegara dynasty who stepped aside when Islamic forces overthrew the Tarumanegara dynasty and built the Banten Islamic empire on the west coast of Java Island.

His process involved depositing a layer of metallic silver onto the glass via the chemical reduction of silver nitrate. This process of coating glass with a reflective substance (silvering) was adapted for the mass production of mirrors. Today, mirrors are often produced by vacuum depositing aluminum (or sometimes silver) directly onto a glass substrate. Mirrors were originally made of shiny strips or sheets of metal, usually silver or copper metal when the reflected image was to be seen but also of other metals when only used to focus light. Most modern mirrors consist of a thin layer of aluminum overlaid with a glass chip. This mirror is called \"back silvered\", in which the reflecting surface is seen through the glass. Coating the mirror with glass makes the mirror resistant, but reduces mirror quality due to the additional softening of the front surface of the glass. Such a mirror reverses about 80% of the incident light. The \"back\" of the mirror is often painted completely black to protect the metal from abrasion. Telescopes and other optical equipment use \"front silvered\" mirrors, in which a reflecting surface is placed on the glass surface, which gives a better image quality. Silver is sometimes used, but most of these mirrors are aluminum, which reflects short waves better. of silver. The front plated mirror reflects 90% to 95% of the incident light. Because the metal rusts in the presence of oxygen and moisture, the plated front mirror needs to be surface-replaced repeatedly to maintain quality.

A concave mirror is a mirror whose surface is curved inward, resembling a spherical surface. The center of the mirror has a farther distance from the object than the edges of the mirror. There is an imaginary point at the center of the mirror's curvature that is the same distance from every point on the mirror's surface. Concave mirrors are used in the reflecting surfaces of vehicle headlights, flashlights and other spotlight-type lamps. The image formed by a concave mirror depends on the object's position on the mirror with the following conditions: The concave mirror is converging and the focus value is positive. A convex mirror is a mirror whose surface is curved outwards. The center of the mirror is closer to the object than the edges.

Convex mirrors are diverging and the focal value is negative.

For example, aluminum mirrors are usually coated with magnesium fluoride. Reflection as a function of wavelength depends on the thickness of the coating and how the layers are laid. For scientific optical work, dielectric mirrors are usually used. The mirror is a glass substrate (or sometimes another material) in which one or more dielectric layers are deposited, to form an optical layer. By carefully selecting the type and thickness of the dielectric layer, the range of wavelengths and the amount of light reflected from the mirror can be specified. The best mirrors of this type are capable of reflecting 99.999% of light (in a narrow range of wavelengths) and are often used in lasers. In a plane mirror, parallel rays undergo a total change in direction, but still remain parallel; The image formed in a plane mirror is a virtual image, which is the same size as the original object. There are also curved mirrors, in which a parallel beam of light becomes a converging beam, whose rays intersect in the focus (point image) of the mirror. The latter is a convex mirror, in which a parallel beam becomes scattered (divergent), with the rays scattering from an intersection \"behind\" the mirror. The drawback of spherical concave lenses and convex mirrors is that they cannot focus parallel rays to a single point due to spherical aberration. Parabolic reflectors overcome this problem by allowing incident parallel rays (eg, light from a distant star) to be focused to a small point; approaching an ideal point.

It has a very small mass, although recent experiments (see Super-Kamiokande) show that it is not exactly zero. Neutrinos interact only through weak and gravitational interactions, neither through strong interactions nor electromagnetic interactions. A neutrino is a subatomic particle that is very similar to an electron, but has no electrical charge and a very small mass, which might even be zero. Neutrinos are one of the most abundant particles in the universe. Because they have very little interaction with matter, however, they are incredibly difficult to detect. To detect neutrinos, very large and very sensitive detectors are required. Typically, a low-energy neutrino will travel through many light-years of normal matter before interacting with anything. Consequently, all terrestrial neutrino experiments rely on measuring the tiny fraction of neutrinos that interact in reasonably sized detectors. For example, at the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory, a 1000 ton heavy water solar-neutrino detector picks up about 1012 neutrinos every second. About 30 neutrinos per day are detected. Neutrinos are created as a result of certain types of radioactive decay or as a result of nuclear reactions such as those that occur in the Sun, in nuclear reactors, or when cosmic rays strike a group of atoms. There are three types (or \"flavors)\" of neutrinos: electron neutrinos, muon neutrinos, and tauon neutrinos (or tau neutrinos); and each type also has a corresponding antiparticle, called an antineutrino.

Neutrinos were first postulated in December, 1930 by Wolfgang Pauli to describe the energy spectrum of beta decay, the decay of a neutron into a proton and an electron. Pauli theorized that an undetected particle was responsible for the difference between the energy and angular momentum of the particles at the beginning and end of the decay.

Isogamy occurs when the female and male sex cells are the same size and are difficult to distinguish. Oogamy occurs when male sex cells and female sex cells have different shapes and sizes.

Modern classification attempts to present monophilic groups based on ultrastructure, biochemistry, and genetics. Because protists are paraphiles such systems often break up or leave the kingdom, rather than treating the protist group as eukaryotes.

Flagellates eat using a filter, that is, by passing water through their flagella. Other protists can engulf bacteria and digest them internally, by extending their cell walls around their food, to form a food vacuole. This food then enters the cell by endocytosis (usually phagocytosis; sometimes pinocytosis). Some protists reproduce sexually (conjugation), while others asexually (binary fission). Plasmodium falciparum, has a super complex biological life cycle which includes a wide variety of living things, some reproduce sexually, others asexually. However, it is still unclear how often sexual reproduction causes genetic exchange between different strains of Plasmodium and most parasitic protists are clonal lines that rarely exchange genes with other strains. Some protists are pathogenic to animals and plants. Plasmodium falciparum causes malaria in humans and Phytophthora infestans causes late blight on potatoes. A deeper understanding of protists will enable this disease to be treated efficiently. Researchers from the Agricultural Research Service use protists as pathogens to control red fire ant (Solenopsis invicta) populations in Argentina. With the help of spore-producing protists such as Kneallhazia solenopsae the red fire ant population can be reduced by 53-100%. The researchers managed to inject the protist into flies as an intermediate to kill the red fire ants, without harming the flies. The beneficial types of protists are types of algae (red algae, Cyanophyta, and others) which can be used for cosmetic ingredients and can be consumed. Plant-like protists such as Ulva lactuca are also commonly consumed as vegetables such as sea lettuce. There are also algae that can be used as fertilizer because they contain various plant nutrients which include nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium and magnesium.",

Prayer activities include words and deeds that begin with the takbir movement and end with the greeting gesture. The position of prayer in Islam is the second pillar of Islam. Prayer is a special worship in Islam because the order for its implementation was received by the Prophet Muhammad from Allah directly. Prayer is used as the main marker in the status of a Muslim's faith. Performing prayers is the first sign of Islam, while leaving prayer is the first sign of disbelief. According to Islamic law, the practice of prayer must be in accordance with all the instructions and procedures exemplified by the Prophet Muhammad as a figure of the embodiment of God's commands. The evidence regarding the obligation to pray is found in the Al-Qur'an, hadiths and the consensus of the scholars. There are nine requirements that must be met in carrying out the prayer, namely Islam, understanding, mumayyiz, purification, covering the genitals, clean from uncleanness, knowing the time of prayer, facing the Qibla and having the intention. In addition, there are fourteen pillars of prayer, as many as fourteen kinds of movements and utterances, as well as eight things that cancel prayer. Prayers are generally divided into two types, namely obligatory prayers and sunnah prayers. Fardu prayer is divided into 5 certain times which are done every day and are mandatory. Meanwhile, sunnah prayers are recommended to be performed at certain times, especially on Islamic holidays. The word prayer is an absorption word in Arabic, namely shalla.

The movement of takbir must be preceded by an intention and have certain requirements before being implemented. Abu Hanifah added the meaning of this prayer by giving the general characteristics of the movement, namely standing, bowing and prostrating.

In the performance of prayer, a relationship arises between humans as creatures created by God, and God as the creator of creatures, namely humans.

The Prophet Muhammad also gave an analogy regarding the importance of prayer for Islam and Muslims. Prayer is likened to a pillar that supports a building. In this analogy, the building is Islam which is built on the basis of jihad. Prayer is used as a strengthening of the foundation of Islam and a support for the path to achieving jihad against Allah. Allah ordered the implementation of prayers on the prophets he sent, including the Prophets Abraham, Prophet Isma'il, Prophet Musa, Prophet Isa and Prophet Muhammad.

In the concept of Islam, Allah is always in any place. The purpose of determining the Qibla is only as a symbol of the unity of Muslims around the world. Qibla is not known by other Abrahamic religions, namely Judaism and Christianity. In the beginning, the Muslim prayers were oriented towards Al-Jami' al-Aqsa in Jerusalem before finally being commanded by Allah to change the Qibla to the building that was founded by the Prophets Abraham and Ismail, namely the Kaaba which is inside the Grand Mosque. This Qibla direction shift occurred when the Prophet Muhammad and his followers were carrying out prayers in Medina. The prayer position at that time was facing north according to the position of Al-Jami' al-Aqsa. After the change in Qibla direction was revealed by Allah to the Prophet Muhammad, the Qibla for the next prayer was shifted to the south facing the Kaaba in Makkah. This transfer process begins at the end of the day, so that at the beginning of the day, the Qibla direction is still facing Al-Jami' al-Aqsa. Al-Qur'an verses that clarify the status of the Kaaba as the Qibla of Muslims are Surah Al-Baqarah verses 144, 149 and 150.

The law of prayer is generally divided into two, namely obligatory and sunnah. Salat that is obligatory is called fard salat, while what is sunnah to do is called sunnah salat. In certain situations and conditions, the obligation to perform salat is given certain relief. For example, when someone is sick and when they are on a trip. If a person is sick enough to be unable to stand, then he is allowed to pray in a sitting position, whereas if he is unable to sit, he is allowed to pray lying down. When lying down he is not able to do certain movements he can do it with gestures. Whereas when a person is on a journey, he is allowed to combine (plural) or summarize (qashar) his prayers.

The conditions that must be possessed in the individual include being Muslim, puberty, having common sense, and knowing the pillars of prayer. While the conditions that come from outside the individual are cleanliness and purity from hadas and najis, the punctuality of the prayer and the position of the prayer facing the Qibla. The first requirement for the validity of the prayer is that the performer must believe in the truth of Islam. A person's prayer is considered invalid when he becomes a kafir. Infidels who return to Islam are obliged to make up their prayers in order to return to Islam. This evidence is obtained from Surah Al-Baqarah verse 217. On the other hand, converts are not required to make up the prayers they left as long as they are still unbelievers. Sins while still being a disbeliever are forgiven by God according to the explanation in Surah Al-Anfal verse 38. The sign of puberty for humans is the same as the sign of entering puberty. For men, this sign is a wet dream. While for women, the sign of puberty is the occurrence of menstruation. Before reaching the age of puberty, prayer does not have the status of an obligation, but after reaching the age of puberty, the status of prayer becomes obligatory. Children who have not yet reached puberty are exempt from the obligation to perform prayers. This is in accordance with the hadith narrated by Abu Dawud, Muhammad bin Isa at-Tirmidhi and Muhammad bin Ismail al-Bukhari. Before performing salat, every Muslim must perform ablution.

Next, what is washed is the face, the palms of the hands up to the elbows, wiping the head and washing the soles of the feet up to the heels. The implementation of this ablution is done sequentially. Wudu can be invalid due to several things. The most common cause is discharge of feces from the anus or genitals. The next cause is sleeping with the body on the stomach or legs raised. Ablution can also be canceled due to the person performing ablution losing their common sense due to drunkenness, illness, epilepsy, or insanity. The cancellation of ablution is also caused by direct skin-to-skin contact with non-mahram people. The presence or absence of lust does not affect the cancellation of ablution.

Extending the word \"akbaaar\" can change the meaning of the word. When the word Akbar is extended, it will mean a kind of plant or drum that only has one striking side. In addition, the prayer priest who extends the word \"abar\" can make the congregation precede him in the pillars of prayer. Makmum in this sense completes the pronunciation of takbir before the imam, thereby violating the pillars of prayer. Nawafil prayer is an additional prayer besides fardu prayer. Nawafil prayer is divided into three levels, namely sunnah prayer, mustahab prayer and tathawwu' prayer. These three levels are often combined into one, namely sunnah prayers, but the three still have differences. The sunnah prayer is an additional prayer that the Prophet Muhammad had performed continuously during his lifetime. Mustahab prayers are prayers whose implementation is known in the hadith, but their continuous implementation is not found in the hadith.

This attitude is a reflection of human reasoning ability, even the highest ability of all things. Stoicism was popular for about five centuries (3 BC-3 AD), then influenced many Christian thinkers, both in the academic world and in attitudes to life. The focus of stoic philosophy is in the field of ethics. The Stoics differ sharply from other old intellectual ideas, namely Epicureanism and Skepticism. Stoicism is the most successful and very influential philosophical school in Ancient Greek Philosophy because of its relevance to human attitudes and the government system at that time.

It appears that young Zeno had been inspired by Socrates' ethical teachings, especially Socrates' courage in walking the path of voluntary death. This action seems to illustrate the Stoic teachings in ethics, that one does not need to be carried away by negative emotions (pathos), fear for example, but is happy with full freedom, including accepting the way of death. The principles and teachings of Stoicism have influenced the thinking of Christian theologians and philosophers throughout the centuries, even today, and the striking legacy of Stoicism philosophy is about living ethically with good morality, as inherited by several thinkers, namely Baruch Spinoza, Joseph Butler, Immanuel Kant, and Helmut Richard Niebuhr.

        "paragraph": "Stoic figures or Stoics, in political ethics are divided into two groups, those who are anti-politics or stay away from political involvement, and those who are actively involved in politics. The two groups have different views. For those who stay away from politics, their reason is because they are fed up with the behavior of the political elite, and believe that laws that must be obeyed are not state laws, but natural laws regulated by the divine. In addition, they were still heavily influenced by Cynicism which strongly criticized the tyrannical government at that time. While those who choose to be involved and have a career in politics, Cicero for example, said that political duties are sacred duties imposed by God on humans, the reward is heaven. In relations with other human beings, we do not need political laws, but must live in friendship and kinship with all beings, as Plutarch quotes (Moralia, 329A) from Zeno's Politeia. The reason is simple, the early Stoics rejected the system of government at that time, a government that so tyrannical. The early Stoics also rejected educational systems and teachings that ignored the importance of living together in friendship, brotherhood, and non-enmity. They seem to reject every political system, even the use of currency they do not recommend. Whereas later Stoics, such as Cicero, Seneca the Younger, and Markus Aurelius, were actually involved in the political arena, Cicero was a member of the City council, Seneca had been an adviser to Emperor Nero, and Marcus Aurelius was an Emperor. So, the Stoics do have paradoxical teachings in politics, some are anti-political, and some are precisely in political circles. For Seneca, Cicero, and Marcus Aurelius, someone who holds a political position must have personal integrity. Good government should not only be inhabited by people who know wisdom -as Plato once initiated in the Aristocratic government system -, but must also be a sophist, that is, someone who really does wisdom.",

So, the Stoics do have paradoxical teachings in politics, some are anti-political, and some are precisely in political circles. Stoic ethics rests on the principle that virtue is good, besides that, bad. Other things are neutral in nature (English: indifferent, Greek: adiaphora), although some of them, for example health, prosperity, honor are naturally recommended, while the opposite is not recommended. For example, private ownership is absolutely not encouraged because it is not in harmony with the human principle of wanting to be happy. If humans are not aware of the temptations of neutral things, they can be trapped in the act of justifying ways to achieve neutral things, or they are actually unhappy when used by neutral things. For example, a person who continuously pursues material possessions, actually he can no longer be happy, because he has been controlled by things that should not hinder him from being happy. The fiercest battle is that of human wisdom and self-control against self-indulgence. Apart from the Stoics rejecting the influence of external things (wealth, health, reputation), the Stoics also rejected the influence of things that bend reason, for example fear of death, fear of gods or gods, and bad events that would interfere with happiness. The trick is not to cut ties with these frightening things, but to straighten our minds so that we are not controlled by the emotions that arise from these things. Happiness cannot be taken away by these events, although we cannot control all events in our hands. By improving our reasoning, we are able to control our behavior in dealing with it.",

In the Big Indonesian Dictionary, investment means investing money or capital in a company or project for the purpose of making a profit. In general, investment can be interpreted as spending or utilizing time, money or energy for future benefits/benefits. So, investment is buying something that is expected in the future to be resold at a higher value than the original. Based on economic theory, investment means the purchase (and production) of capital goods that are not consumed but are used for future production (produced goods). For example, building a railroad or factory. Investment is a component of GDP with the formula PDB=C+I+G+(X\u2212M){\\displaystyle PDB=C+I+G+(X-M)}. The investment function in this aspect is divided into non-residential investment (such as factories and machinery) and residential investment (new houses). Investment is a function of income and the interest rate, seen in relation to I=(Y,i){\\displaystyle I=(Y,i)}. An increase in income will encourage greater investment, whereas a higher interest rate will reduce the interest in investing as it will be more expensive than borrowing money. Even if another firm chooses to use its own funds for investment, the interest rate represents an opportunity cost of investing those funds rather than lending to earn interest. In language, the word investment comes from the word \"investire\" which means to use or use. Meanwhile, in terms of investment means giving something to other people to be developed and the results of something that is developed will be shared according to what was agreed.",

If the investment is made by an individual, the goal is to accumulate funds to buy a house or land in the future and finance children's education in the future. Individual investment also aims to get a better life in the future, maintain income from inflation, and leave a legacy for the family. Investments made by foreign parties in a developing country aim to improve the welfare of the people in that country. For developing countries, foreign investment will be beneficial for expanding employment, building facilities and infrastructure, developing technology, and encouraging industrial development. Some investment products are known as securities or securities. The definition of securities is an ownership instrument that can be transferred in the form of securities, shares/bonds, proof of debt, interest or participation in a collective agreement (mutual funds), the right to buy a share, a guarantee to buy shares in the future or other instruments. which can be traded. In addition, investment products can be in the form of savings, time deposits, gold, property and collectibles. In general, individual investments are divided into two types, namely tangible asset investments and financial assets. Tangible asset investment is a type of investment in the form of tangible objects such as vehicles, buildings, factories, houses and apartments. Investments in financial assets are tangible financial investments such as stocks, mutual funds, bonds and pension funds.

Indirect investment or portfolio investment is a short-term investment made by buying securities. In this type of investment, an investor is not directly involved in managing the company and is not required to establish a business entity. Indirect investment occurs when securities owned are resold by investment companies that function as intermediaries. Investors will receive benefits in the form of capital gains on the results of portfolio trading carried out by the intermediary company. Meanwhile, based on the time period, investments are classified into two types, namely short-term investments and long-term investments. Short-term investment is one of the investment products by depositing a number of funds to be managed in a short period of time, so that funds and profits can be disbursed in a relatively short period of time. The term of this investment is generally one year. Short term investment has lower risk so it is recommended for beginners. Examples of short-term investments are deposits, mutual funds, government bonds, and fintech peer to peer lending. Long-term investment is a type of investment that takes a long time to get a profit or return.

With brains that are smarter than animals, humans design more targeted hunting so they can hunt large animals. With the ability of the brain like this, humans can think farther up beyond reason and use imagination and spiritual. Language for communication has been formed among humans. From simple language and speech to danger signs and giving animal names, slowly some vocabulary appears to name objects and give someone a nickname.

CPV-2 is closely related to panleukopenia virus (FPV) and mink enteritis virus (MEV). CPV-2 replicates in cells of the intestine, lymphoid system, bone marrow and fetal tissues. The effects of CPV on these tissues are generally severe. Parvovirus is resistant to inactivation. The virus can remain infectious in faecally contaminated soil for more than 5 months under the right conditions. Disinfectants and detergents generally fail to inactivate parvovirus. Under suitable pH and temperature conditions, CPV haemagglutinates red blood cells in several animal species. The effect of agglutinating red cells may be lost with repeated passages in tissue culture. However, a hemagglutination test can be used to test for the presence of CPV using a stool specimen. Clinical symptoms of CPV-2 infection in puppies are watery or bloody diarrhea, repeated vomiting and anorexia. Other clinical symptoms are fever, weakness, lymphopenia especially neutropenia. Animals also experience dehydration, weight loss, and abdominal pain. In puppies, the first visible symptoms are the body's condition which continues to weaken and loss of appetite. Unlike the loss of appetite which is commonly found in other cases, symptoms of parvovirus can be seen from the behavior of sufferers who are very weak, tend not to want to move and are unresponsive to the environment.

Agar-agar is contained in the cell walls of several types of sea weeds. Agar is actually a mixture of two saccharides (carbohydrates) with a high molecular mass, namely agarose (ca 70%) and agaropectin (ca 30%). Agarose belongs to the pectin group and is a polymer composed of double units made from D-galactose and 3,6-anhydro-L-galactopyranose which also contains S (sulphur). The gel is formed because when heated in water, the molecules of agar and water move freely. When cooled, the agar molecules begin to close together, condense and form a lattice that encloses the water molecules, forming a solid-liquid colloidal system. This lattice is used in agarose gel electrophoresis to inhibit the movement of object molecules due to the difference in voltage between the two poles. The density of the agar gel is also strong enough to support small plants, so it is often used as a medium in tissue culture. Agar-agar can be formed into a powder and traded. Hysteresis is a characteristic of agar and a number of other gel materials, which is related to the temperature of the solid-liquid phase transition. Agar begins to melt at 85\u00b0C and begins to solidify at 32-40\u00b0C. So it's not like water solidifies and melts at the same temperature point.",

Meanwhile, ethane is a hydrocarbon (more specifically, an alkane) consisting of two carbon atoms united by a single bond, each holding three carbon atoms: C2H6 and propane are hydrocarbons having three C atoms (C3H8) and so on with the structural formula CnH2 \u00b7n+2 (where n is the number of carbon/hydrogen atoms). Hydrocarbons can be grouped based on the nomenclature of organic compounds as follows: Hydrocarbons can be in the form of gases (for example methane and propane), liquids (for example hexane and benzene), waxes or low boiling point solids (for example paraffin wax and naphthalene) or polymers (for example polyethylene, polypropylene). and polystyrene). Because the molecular structures are different, the empirical formulas of the hydrocarbons are also different: the number of hydrocarbons bonded to alkenes and alkynes must be less because the carbon atoms are double bonded. The ability of hydrocarbons to bond with themselves is known as catenation, and this allows them to form more complex compounds, such as cyclohexane or arenes such as benzene. This ability is obtained because the characteristics of the bonds between carbon atoms are non-polar. In accordance with the valence bond theory, carbon atoms must comply with the \"4-hydrogen\" rule which states the maximum number of atoms that can bond with carbon, because carbon has 4 valence electrons. Judging from the valence electrons, carbon has 4 electrons which can form covalent bonds or dative bonds. Hydrocarbons are hydrophobic and belong to lipids.",

In the reaction below, an alkane reacts with a molecule of chlorine. One of the chlorine atoms replaces the hydrogen atom. This reaction forms hydrochloric acid as well as a hydrocarbon with one chlorine atom. Reacts to CCl4 (carbon tetrachloride). Reacts to C2Cl6 (hexachloroethane). Addition reactions occur in alkenes and alkynes. In this reaction, a halogen molecule breaks the double bond in the alkene or the triple bond in the alkyne and forms a new bond. The common characteristics of hydrocarbons are that they produce steam, carbon dioxide, and heat during combustion, and oxygen is required for the combustion reactions to take place. The following is an example of a methane combustion reaction: If the air is poor in oxygen gas, carbon monoxide (CO) and water will be formed: Another example, the propane combustion reaction: The combustion reaction of hydrocarbons is an exothermic chemical reaction.

Today, hydrocarbons are the world's main source of electrical and thermal energy because of the energy they produce when they are burned. This hydrocarbon energy is usually used directly as heating in homes, in the form of oil or natural gas. Hydrocarbons are burned and the heat is used to evaporate water, which then spreads throughout the room. Almost the same principle is used in power plants. Hydrocarbon resin is the basic ingredient in the manufacture of thermoplastics used for road markings. A thermoplastic made from a mixture of hydrocarbon resins and glass beads results in highly reflective, strong road markings and a long service life. Mixing of hydrocarbons and ester resins is used as a thermoplastic chemical bond former.

        "paragraph": "Meiosis (from the Greek for \"reduction\") is a type of cell division that occurs in organisms that reproduce sexually to produce gamete cells such as sperm or egg cells. The main feature of meiosis is that it occurs in two stages of division. Ultimately, cells that undergo meiosis will produce four cells with each cell having only one copy of the parent chromosome (haploid). In addition, before the first division, the chromosomes of cells undergoing meiosis will share genetic material with each other in a process called crossing over which will result in a combination of genetic material in each of the cell's chromosomes. Later, when this haploid meiotic cell fuses with another haploid cell in a process called fertilization, the cell with two pairs of chromosomes (diploid) will form again as a zygote. This mechanism of meiosis allows organisms that reproduce sexually to maintain the number of chromosomes. In humans and animals, meiosis occurs in the gonads and produces gamete cells such as spermatocytes or egg cells. In plants, meiosis occurs in the antheridium and ovary and produces meiospores which will later differentiate into gamete cells as well. The first stage that occurs in the process of meiosis is DNA replication. This DNA replication will produce a new chromatid for each chromosome (now the term chromosome refers to the two sister chromatids). Next, the first meiotic division will produce haploid cells but still have sister chromatids so that another division is needed to release sister chromatids. This haploid cell is the end product of meiosis which has half the chromosomes of the parent. The first division is called meiosis I and the second division is called meiosis II. Before meiosis can begin, the cell must first undergo interphase.",

After DNA replication, the cell will enter the G2 phase. Furthermore, homologous chromosomes (chromosomes that encode the same properties, but one is of paternal origin, while the other is of maternal origin) will pair with each other to form a tetrad and share genetic material in a process called genetic recombination. This process is aided by a physical bridge formed between the two homologous chromosomes called chiasmata (from the Greek, chi (X)). In many organisms, this bonding will direct each pair of homologous chromosomes to separate from each other in the process of meiosis I, resulting in a haploid cell that has half the number of chromosomes but its sister chromatids are still attached. In meiosis II, the cohesion between these sister chromatids begins to break free and they begin to segregate from one another as in the process of mitosis. This process results in four types of cells that have haploid chromosomes and no longer have sister chromatids. In some organisms, these four cells will turn into gametes such as sperm, spores, or pollen. In female animals (including humans), three of these four cells will be eliminated to become polar bodies so that only one cell will develop into a gamete to form an egg (ovum). Because their chromosome number is halved during meiosis, these gametes can fuse (fertilize) to form a diploid zygote consisting of two copies of a chromosome, one from each parent. Thus, repeated cycles between meiosis and fertilization allow sexual reproduction to occur. Through this cycle, the next generation can maintain the same number of chromosomes as its parent.",

Errors in the process of meiosis will result in a condition called aneuploidy, which is a condition in which cells resulting from meiosis have an inappropriate number of chromosomes.Aneuploidy is one of the main causes of miscarriage and one of the most important causes of abnormalities in fetal development.Meiosis occurs in all eukaryotic organisms that reproduce sexuallya], either organisms e single cell or multicellular. Although meiosis is related to the process of mitosis that is more common in every organism, it differs from mitosis in two very important aspects: Meiosis begins with cells that are diploid, that is, cells that have two copies of each chromosome. These two copies of the chromosome are called homologous chromosomes. First of all, the cell undergoes DNA replication, so that each of these homologous chromosomes will replicate itself to form an identical structure called sister chromatids. Furthermore, each of these homologous pairs will form chiasmata, which are bridges between these homologous chromosomes and share genetic information with genetic recombination. Paired chromosome structures that have paired chromatids and paired homologous chromosomes are called tetrads.

Due to genetic recombination, a single chromatid will have the combined genetic information from both the father and the mother, resulting in a child that is genetically different from both parents. The genetic differences that result from sexual reproduction contribute to the variation in traits that a species can have. These properties will later be selected by nature. Meiosis uses much the same mechanism as mitosis, namely the cell division used by eukaryotes to divide a cell into two identical cells. In some plants, fungi, and protists, meiois produces spores, which are haploid cells that can divide without having to go through fertilization. Some eukaryotes, such as rotifers, are unable to carry out meiosis. But they can reproduce via parthenogenesis. Meiosis is neither present in archaea nor in bacteria, which usually reproduce asexually by binary fission. However, they also have a \"sexual\" process called horizontal gene transfer. This process allows both bacteria and archaea to submit their DNA and this DNA will be recombined with other DNA to produce a DNA molecule that is a mixture of two different origins. Meiosis is divided into two, namely meiosis I and meiosis II. This division can also be further divided into karyokinesis I, cytokinesis I, karyokinesis II, and cytokinesis II. The preparatory stages prior to meiosis are identical to the interphase stages of mitosis. Interphase is divided into three stages: Interphase continues with meiosis I and meiosis II.",

In meiosis II, sister chromatids separate so that the chromosomes separate into four daughter cells. For diploid organisms, the daughter cells resulting from this meiosis will inherit one copy of each chromosome. Meiosis I and II are equally divided into several stages, namely prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. These phases are analogous to those in mitosis. However, in meiosis these stages are given Roman numerals according to which meiosis phase they are in. So that meiosis consists of prophase I, metaphase I, anaphase I, telophase I, prophase II, metaphase II, anaphase II, and telophase II. In meiosis, some genes are highly transcribed. In addition, there are also specific protein translation mechanisms that regulate the phases of meiosis. Therefore, it is both transcription and translation of genes that govern the restructuring of cells to carry out meiosis. Meiosis I separates homologous chromosomes, previously fused as tetrads (2n, 4k), resulting in two haploid cells (n) with each cell having a chromatid pair (1n, 2k). Because ploidy decreases from diploid to haploid, meiosis I is also called reduced division. Meiosis II is a balanced division analogous to mitosis, in which sister chromatids separate to produce four haploid cells (1n, 1k). Prophase I is the longest phase of meiosis. In mice, this phase occurs for 13 of the 14 days of total meiosis. In prophase I, homologous chromosomes will pair up to form synapses and will exchange genetic information through crossing over. This crossing over is visible on the chromosomes as chiasmata.",

These replicated pairs of homologous chromosomes are called bivalents (two chromosomes) or tetrads (four chromatids), with one chromosome coming from one parent. Prophase I is further divided into further stages which are named after the shape of the chromosome itself. The first phase of prophase I is the leptotene phase, or also called leptonema, from the Greek meaning \"thin thread\". At this stage, the chromosomes (which each have sister chromatids) are visible as threads in the nucleus. The next chromosome will begin to pair with its homologous chromosome with the help of cohesin to form a synaptonemal complex. Recombination begins at this stage aided by the enzyme SPO11 which regulates DNA double-strand separation (about 300 per meiosis in mice). This process will produce single-stranded DNA coated by RAD51 and DMC1 which will form bridges between homologous chromosomes, resulting in pairs of homologous chromosomes with a distance of ~400nm. After the leptotene, there is the zygotene phase, also called zigonema which means \"paired threads\". At this stage, the homologous chromosomes attach more closely (~100nm) and are more stable so that synapsis occurs, namely the pairing of two homologous chromosomes. Synapses are assisted by the central and transverse portions of the synaptonemal complex. Synapses (the meeting point between two homologous chromosomes) are formed by a process much like a zipper being pulled together and starting at the point of recombination. These paired chromosomes are called bivalent or tetrad. The pakiten stage, also known as pakinema, which comes from the Greek for \"thick thread\", is the stage where all the chromosomes have synapsed. The homologous recombination stage, including crossing over, is completed by the reunion of the DNA double strands that were previously split in the leptotene phase.",

However, in some parts of the fraction (at least one per chromosome) can form crossing over between other non-homologous chromosomes so as to form the exchange of genetic information. However, the sex chromosomes can only exchange genetic information in a small area called the pseudoautosome area. Even though this crossing over has occurred in areas called chiasmata, these chiasmata are still not clearly visible under a microscope because they are still covered by the synaptonemal complex. In the diplotene phase, also called diplotene from the Greek word meaning \"two threads\", the synaptonemal complex is broken down and the homologous chromosomes are slightly separated from each other, but not where crossing over occurs, so that the tetrad shape can be seen. The places where crossing over occurs are called chiasmata. Chiasmata remain on chromosomes until anaphase I where homologous chromosomes are forced to move to opposite parts of the cell. In fetal oogenesis, all developing oocytes terminate at this stage. This state of the oocyte is called the dictiotene or diktiate stage. In the oocyte, new cells will continue meiosis at the time of ovulation that occurs at puberty. Chromosomes condense at the stage of diakinesis which is Greek for \"moving\". This is the first stage of meiosis where the four parts of the tetrad are clearly visible. Places where crossing over occurs sometimes appear stacked so that the chiasmata are clearly visible. In addition, this stage is similar to the prometaphase in mitosis, in that the nucleolus begins to disappear, the nuclear membrane disintegrates into vesicles, and spindle fibers begin to form. Pairs of homologous chromosomes begin to move on the metagasse plane.

The microtubules attached to the kinetochore shorten, pulling the homologous chromosomes (those with sister chromatids) to opposite poles. Microtubules that are not attached to the kinetochores elongate, pushing the centrosomes away from each other. This makes the cell elongate and prepare to divide. Unlike in mitosis, only the cohesin on the chromosome arm is degraded. The cohesin that surrounds the centromere remains protected by a protein called Shugosin (from Japanese \"guardian creature\") which keeps the sister chromatids together. This makes sister chromatids stick together even though their homologous chromosome pairs separate. The first meiotic division ends when the chromosomes reach opposite poles. Each daughter cell now has half the original number of chromosomes but still has sister chromatids. The microtobules that previously propagated in the spindle network in the cell began to disappear and the nuclear membrane began to form on the haploid chromosome pair. The chromosomes begin to fade back into chromatin. The cell membrane begins to undergo cytokinesis, the process by which the cell membrane begins to pinch (or in plants, the formation of the cell wall) occurs. Cytokinesis completes the formation of two daughter cells. However, cytokinesis that does not occur completely will form a \"cytokinetic bridge\" which allows the two daughter cells to still unite until the end of meiosis II. Sister chromatids are still present at telophase I. The cell may enter a resting phase called interkinesis or interphase II. There is no more DNA replication in this phase.

The four stages of meiosis II are prophase II, metaphase II, anaphase II, and telophase II . In prophase II, the nucleolus and nuclear membrane begin to disappear and the chromatids begin to thicken. Centrosomes begin to move towards the opposite poles and begin to arrange the spindle threads to prepare for division in meiosis II. In metaphase II, the centromere which has two kinetochores will attach to the spindle threads which are connected to the centromeres at different poles. The new metaphase plane will be formed and rotated 90 degrees compared to the first meiosis. Cleavage continues with anaphase II, in which the centromere cohensins are no longer protected by Shugoshin, so the sister chromatids can now separate. Sister chromatids can now be called chromosomes because they separate to different poles. This process ends with telophase II. This process is similar to telophase I, in which the chromosomes begin to recondense and the spindle fibers begin to unravel. The nuclear membrane begins to reform and the cell pinches off to form two new cells. So this process ends with a total of four haploid daughter cells. The origin of meiosis is not completely understood. Currently, there is no consensus among scientists about how sex arose in eukaryotes through evolution. This is important because it is sex that requires meiosis. Other questions that arise are what exactly is the function of sex and why sex is maintained in evolution, considering that sexual reproduction is not efficient because it has twice the cost of asexual reproduction (asexual organisms can reproduce much faster than sexual people). .",

Meiosis is a key cycle in eukaryotes. Meiosis can be found from single-celled organisms such as yeast to complex multicellular organisms such as humans. Eukaryotes evolved from prokaryotes over 2.2 billion years ago. Apart from mutations, meiosis is a way of creating new combinations of DNA to create new alleles, which may be of use to an organism. Meiosis creates genetic variation in two ways, namely the law of free assortation and crossing over. The law of independent asortment states that the orientation of pairs of homologous chromosomes and pairs of sister chromatids can occur randomly and is not related to the orientation of the chromosomes or other chromatids. This allows for a random distribution of chromosomes to each cell resulting from meiosis. In addition, crossing over allows the transfer of genetic material between two homologous chromosomes resulting in chromosomes with new genetic information. Meiosis occurs in the life cycle of eukaryotes that undergo sexual reproduction. This process occurs in parallel with the occurrence of mitosis. At certain stages, germ cells will produce gamete cells through the process of meiosis. While functional body cells will be produced by somatic cells produced through the process of mitosis. In multicellular organisms, meiosis and fertilization occur repeatedly. This repetition results in a transition between the haploid and diploid states of the organism. The life of an organism can occur in the diploid period, so it is called diplontic, or the organism lives in the haplod period, so it is called haplontic, or even both, so it is called haplodiplontic. With division like this, there are three types of organisms that reproduce sexually which are distinguished by the number of chromosomes on which an organism lives.",

The germ cells of these organisms will undergo meiosis to produce haploid gametes, which will fertilize to form a zygote. The diploid zygote will undergo mitosis to develop into an organism. In haplontic organisms, the organism will live with haploid chromosomes. These organisms develop by division and differentiation from single haploid cells called gametes. Two organisms of different sexes will combine their gametes to form a diploid zygote. This zygote will soon undergo meiosis and produce four haploid cells. These haploid cells will divide through mitosis and differentiate to form organisms. Many fungi and protozoa are haplontic organisms. Finally, in the haplodiplontic life cycle, these organisms will alternately experience haploid and diploid cycles. As a result, this cycle is also known as alternation of generations. Its diploid phase will undergo meiosis to produce spores. These spores will be reproduced by mitosis, then will develop to form haploid organisms. This haploid organism will later produce gametes, then fertilize with the gametes of other haploid organisms, forming a zygote. This zygote will later carry out mitosis and differentiate to become a diploid organism again. Ferns and mosses are examples of organisms that undergo alternation of generations. Meiosis occurs in all types of animals and plants. Production of gametes with half the number of chromosomes. But the details of the process are different. In animals, meiosis directly produces gametes. Whereas in plants, there is an alternation of generations where the diploid generation called the sporophyte will produce haploid spores. These spores will divide by mitosis and develop into haploid gametophytes, which will produce gametes directly (without meiosis).

The first division produces a daughter cell and a polar cell which is very small and probably will not go on to meiosis II. In meiosis II, the division of daughter cells returns to produce a small second polar body cell and a haploid cell which enlarges to form an ovum. Therefore, in the female, each primary oocyte that undergoes meiosis will produce one ovum and one or two polar bodies. Meiosis in the female begins as soon as the germ cells migrate to the ovaries in the embryo. Remember that there is a pause during meiosis in females. The developing oocyte will stop in prophase I of meiosis I and will be dormant in a wrapping cell called a follicular cell. At the beginning of each menstrual cycle, the secretion of FSH (English: follicle stimulating hormone) from the pituitary gland will stimulate several follicles to mature. In this process, the oocyte will continue meiosis until it reaches the stage of metaphase II from meiosis II. Furthermore, the oocyte will again stop in this phase just before ovulation. In the process of folliculogenesis in humans, usually one follicle will become dominant and the others will experience atresia. The process of meiosis in females is called oogenesis. This process is different from other meiotic processes because it undergoes a stop phase called the dictate phase and does not require the help of centrosomes.

The tissue of the testis will arrest meiosis by degrading retinoic acid, something that is believed to be a stimulator of meiosis. This degradation stops at puberty when the cells present in the seminiferous tubules, the Sertoli cells, begin to make their own retinoic acid. This sensitivity to retinoic acid is also regulated by protein nanos and DAZL. Studies show that retinoic acid is needed after birth to stimulate spermatogonia differentiation, which is the product of spermatocytes that undergo meiosis. However, retinoic acid is not needed when meiosis is already running. Separation of chromosomes in meiosis I or sister chromatids in meiosis II is called disjunction. When the separation does not run normally, the separation is called non-disjunction. This can be caused by the production of gametes that have an excess or deficiency in the number of chromosomes, which generally causes trisomy or monosomy. Non-disjunction can occur in meisosis I, meiosis II, or even in mitosis. Most human monosomic and trisomic embryos do not survive. However, some aneuploidies can persist, such as trisomy on chromosome number 21 which causes Down syndrome. The phenotype of aneuploidy can vary from the most severe symptoms to no symptoms at all. Some examples are: The probability of non-disjunction will increase with increasing maternal age. kemung. This may be due to reduced cohesin with aging. Apart from non-disjunction, other variations on meiosis are possible by means of meiosis being only one stage. This single-stage meiosis is extremely rare and occurs in only a few flagellates.

The formation of climate in a place is influenced by the location of latitude, slope, altitude, distance from the waters, and conditions of sea water currents. Each region has a different climate. The type of climate in each region is strongly influenced by latitude. The characteristics of global climate patterns are studied through climatology. Climate is also based on weather characteristics that consider rain, temperature, and wind or evaporation conditions. Based on the latitude, the climate on the surface of the Earth can be divided into polar climate, temperate climate, subtropical climate, tropical climate and equatorial climate. Climate can also be distinguished based on regional conditions, namely continental climate, maritime climate, tundra climate, and mountain climate. Climatic conditions are controlled mainly by the atmosphere which is influenced by environmental factors. The types of environmental factors that affect the atmosphere are the shape of the earth, the earth's cover, and the position of air mixing in the atmosphere. The atmosphere influences the weather which then forms climate. The emergence of the term Climate cannot be separated from Paleoclimatology. Paleoclimatology is the study of ancient climates. Since direct observations of climate were not available prior to the 19th century, paleoclimate is inferred from proxy climate variables that include non-biotic evidence such as deposits found in lake bottoms and ice cores, and biotic evidence such as tree rings and coral.

Climate also includes statistics other than averages, such as the magnitude of daily or year-to-year variations. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2001 defined climate as follows: Climate in the narrow sense is usually defined as \"average weather,\" or more precisely, as a statistical description in terms of the averages and variability of relevant quantities over periods ranging from months to months. -months to thousands or millions of years. The classic period is 30 years, as defined by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The most frequently used surface variable quantities are temperature, precipitation, and wind. Climate in a broader sense is the state, including a statistical description, of the climate system. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) defines \"normal\" climate as a \"point of reference\" used by climatologists to compare current climate developments with past or what is considered 'normal'. A normal climate is defined as the arithmetic mean of the climatic elements (eg temperature) over a 30 year period.

In 1982 the WMO agreed to update climate normals, and these were subsequently finalized based on climate data from 1 January 1961 to 31 December 1990. The difference between climate and weather is summed up by the popular line \"Climate is what you expect, weather is what you get. \". Over historical time there have been a number of nearly constant variables determining climate, including latitude, elevation, the proportion of land to water, and the distance between the sea and mountains. Those variables have only changed over millions of years due to processes such as plate tectonics. Other climate determinants are more dynamic such as ocean thermohaline circulation causing 5\u00b0C (9\u00b0F) warming in the north Atlantic Ocean compared to other ocean basins. Other ocean currents redistribute heat between land and water on a more regional scale. The density and type of vegetation cover affect solar heat absorption, water retention, and rainfall at the regional level. Changes in the quantity of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere determine the amount of solar energy stored by the planet, which causes global warming or global cooling. The variables that determine climate are numerous and their interactions are complex, but there is general agreement that standardizing the use of climate variables requires an outline understanding, at least regarding the determinants of historical climate change. The formation of a climate is influenced by the existence of the atmosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, and pedosphere.

The biosphere is the layer of the atmosphere that is still inhabited by living things. The thickness of the biosphere reaches 8 km. The condition of the biosphere is influenced by plant vegetation and human activities. Plant vegetation has seasonal changes that affect the albedo of a geographical area and its hydrological cycle. Meanwhile, human activities in the form of logging, agriculture and urbanization can cause climate change, both locally and globally. The hydrosphere influences climate over a period of months, years or centuries. The influence of the hydrosphere for climate lies in the condition of the oceans. Most of the sun's radiation is absorbed by the oceans which is then evaporated into the atmosphere. The evaporation of water into the atmosphere by the oceans causes the release of ocean heat energy into cloud drops. This condition makes ocean currents a heat diversion for the tropics which receive direct sunlight to the polar regions which are rarely exposed to sunlight. The influence of the cryosphere on climate is related to the reduction of warming on Earth. The cryosphere is mostly located in the polar regions. Meanwhile, a small portion is formed at very high mountain peaks, such as the peaks of the Jayawijaya mountains in Papua. The cryosphere consists of snow and ice. The properties of snow and ice in returning or reflecting solar radiation are better than oceans and land.

In addition, the earth's surface has various types of topography. Each topographical form responds to the sunlight it receives differently. In general, climate types are distinguished and recognized through a review of various aspects, including time, scale, region and type. The most ancient and simplest method of dividing climate types is based on radiation reception. The division of climate types on the basis of radiation reception has been carried out since ancient Greece. Based on radiation reception, the climate is divided into five parts by delimiting four latitudes. First, the tropical climate with a limit of 23oLU\u201323oS. Second, the northern subtropical climate with a limit of 23oLU\u201366.5oLU. Third, the southern subtropical climate with a limit of 23oS\u201366.5oS.

While the indoor climate is a climate that is made in a closed room and applied to agriculture in a greenhouse. Based on the area of \u200b\u200bits formation, climates are divided into polar climates, central climates, subtropical climates, tropical climates and equatorial climates. The division of boundaries between regions is generally not determined with certainty. Polar climate is a climate with very low ambient temperature conditions. In the Koppen climate classification, the highest temperatures of the polar climates are below 2 \u00b0C or 52 \u00b0F, but higher than 0 \u00b0C or 32 \u00b0F. Central climates are climate types located in the mid-latitudes between the polar regions and the tropics. The boundaries of the central climate cannot be clearly defined. Tropical climate is a type of climate in the tropics. The main characteristic of a tropical climate is that the ambient temperature is always high and the annual variation is very small. In addition, it rains almost all the time at erratic times. The subtropical climate is characterized by dry summers and rainy winters. Meanwhile, the equatorial climate is characterized by little daily temperature variation with rain occurring at most twice a year at any time.

Marine climate is a type of climate that has little difference between annual temperature and daily air temperature. The existence of a maritime climate is found in small islands. In addition, a maritime climate is also found in the windward parts of the world, for example the westernmost British Isles. The monsoon climate is a type of climate that is formed in the monsoon area. The main feature of the monsoon climate is the seasonal changes in the elements of the climate. When the sun shines continuously in the monsoon area, it often rains. The monsoon climate is generally in the tropics. The main characteristic of the Mediterranean climate is a hot and dry environment. In summer, the weather is very sunny while in winter, it rains frequently. The characteristics of the Mediterranean climate are very opposite to the monsoon climate. A tundra climate is a climate with very low temperatures, but no snow cover. This type of climate is a place for moss to grow. Mountain climate is a climate that has an increasingly cold environment and low pressure at higher altitudes.

Modern climate classification methods can be broadly divided into genetic methods, which focus on the causes of climate, and empirical methods, which focus on climate effects. Examples of genetic classification include methods based on the relative frequency of different air mass types or locations in synoptic weather disturbances. Examples of empirical classifications include climate zones defined by crop resilience, evapotranspiration, or more generally the K\u00f6ppen climate classification which was originally designed to identify the climate associated with a particular biome. A common drawback of these classification schemes is that they result in different boundaries between the zones they define, rather than the gradual transitions of climatic properties that are more common in nature. The same characteristics in a climate are used as the basis for classifying climate types. Climate classification aims to obtain more general and simple information. This information is then used to statistically analyze weather elements. The results of statistical analysis are then used to determine the boundaries of a type of climate quantitatively. The division of boundaries is carried out on a city or district, provincial, state, regional and global scale. The simplest classification is that involving air masses. The Bergeron classification is the most widely accepted form of air mass classification. The classification of air masses involves three letters. The first letter describes its moisture properties, with c used for continental (dry) air masses and m for maritime (moist) air masses. The second letter \"T\" describes the thermal characteristics of the source area for the tropics, P for the poles, A for the Arctic or Antarctic, M for the rainy season, E for the equator, and S for superior air (dry air formed by significant downward movement in atmosphere).",

While the identification of air masses was originally used in weather forecasting during the 1950s, climatologists began establishing synoptic climatology based on this idea in 1973. Based on Bergeron's classification scheme is the Spatial Synoptic Classification (SSC) system. There are six categories in the SSC scheme: Dry Polar (similar to continental polar), Dry Moderate (similar to maritime superior), Dry Tropical (similar to continental tropical), Moist Polar (similar to maritime polar), Moist Moderate (mixture between maritime polar and maritime tropics), and Humid Tropical (similar to maritime tropics, maritime monsoon, or maritime equatorial). Earth's climate system is a complex system of interactions. The elements involved in the interaction are the atmosphere, land surface, snow and ice, waters and living things. In the interaction between climate elements, the atmosphere determines the existence of the system. The round shape of the earth also influences climate differences in various regions. Sunlight cannot be received evenly by every surface of the Earth because of the spherical shape of the Earth. In addition, the Earth's surface has various types of topography so that the response to the solar radiation it receives is also different. The balance of the climate system can be achieved if the energy balance on Earth is in a state of balance.

        "paragraph": "Ruterfordium is a chemical element in the periodic table having the symbol Rf and atomic number 104. It is a highly radioactive synthetic element whose most stable isotope is 265Rf with a half-life of about 13 hours. This name is taken from the name of the scientist Ernst Rutherford. Later this element was not used for anything and little was known about it. Ruterfordium was the first transactinide element and is thought to have chemical properties similar to hafnium. Ruterfordium (named in honor of Lord Rutherford of Nelson) was first reported as synthesized in 1964 at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna (Soviet Union). Researchers there bombarded 242Pu with 22Ne ions with MeV accelerated from 113 to 115 and stated that they detected traces of nuclear fusion in a special type of glass with a microscope that indicated the presence of the new element. In 1969 researchers from the University of California, Berkeley synthesized the element by subjecting 249Cf and 12C to high energy collisions. The UC group also stated that they were unable to reproduce the earliest synthesis by Soviet scientists. This gave rise to controversy over the naming of elements; Since the Soviets claimed that it was first detected in Dubna, Dubnium (Db) was proposed, like Kurchatovium and the symbol Ku for the 104th element, in honor of Igor Vasilevich Kurchatov (1903\u20131960), former head of Soviet nuclear research. The Americans, however, proposed Rutherfordium (symbol Rf) for the new element in honor of Ernest Rutherford, the famous nuclear physicist from New Zealand. The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) adopted Unnilquadium (symbol Unq) as the systematic element name, provisionally, derived from from the Latin name for the numbers 1, 0, and 4. But in 1997 they broke the dispute and adopted the current name. This chemistry-related article is a stub.",

He had a great influence on European medicine. Galenus was born in Pergamum (now: Bergama, Turkey), the son of Nicon, a wealthy architect. There are differences of opinion regarding his lifetime, the first opinion says Galenus lived in 129-199, while the second opinion says 130-200. He had an interest in agriculture, architecture, astronomy, astrology, philosophy, until finally he chose to concentrate on medicine. At the age of 20 he had been a physician at the temple of Asclepius for 4 years. After the death of his father in 148 or 149, he traveled abroad to study in Smyrna, Corinth, and Alexandria for 12 years. When he returned to Pergamum in 157, he worked as a doctor at the gladiator school for 3 to 4 years. During that time, he learned a lot about treating and healing trauma and wounds. Later he termed the wound as \"a window into the body\". Galenus performed dangerous surgeries that have not been performed for nearly 2 millennia including brain and eye surgery. To operate on cataracts, he inserts a thread-like device into the eye up to the back of the eyepiece. He then pulled on it to remove the cataract. The slightest mistake can lead to permanent blindness. In addition he also laid the foundation for modern medicine standards. In 162, he moved to Rome where he spread the knowledge of anatomy. His reputation continues to rise and is known as an experienced medical expert and has a wide range of clients. One of them was the consul Flavius \u200b\u200bBoethius who finally introduced him to become the royal physician.",

Galenus spent the rest of his life in the kingdom. According to tradition, the year of his death is fixed around the year 200 according to the Suda Lexicon document from the 10th century. However, others suggest that he died in 216, due to the estimate that his last written work was written at the end of 207. Galen made a substantial contribution to Hippocrates' understanding of disease. Under Hippocrates' theory of bodily humoralism, differences in human mood or moods come as a result of an imbalance in one of the four bodily fluids, namely: blood, yellow bile, black bile, and phlegm. Galenus promoted this theory and a typology of human temperament. In Galenus' view, the imbalance of each of these bodily fluids is related to a certain type of human temperament (blood-optimist, black-bile melancholy, yellow bile-choleric, and phlegmatic-apathy). Thus, individuals with a sanguine temperament are extroverted and social; individuals with a choleric temperament have energy, passion, and charisma; melancholics are usually creative, kind, and caring; as well as a phlegmatic temperament characterized by being dependent, friendly, and affectionate. Galenus' main interest was in human anatomy, but Roman law prohibited dissection of human cadavers from around 150 BC. Because of these restrictions, Galenus performed anatomical dissections of living (vivisection) and dead animals, most of which focused on pigs and primates. This work was useful because Galenus believed that the anatomical structures of these animals were very similar to those of humans. Galenus clarified the anatomy of the trachea and he was the first to show that the larynx could produce sound. In one experiment, Galenus used bellows to inflate the lungs of a dead animal.",

In the mid-16th century, the anatomist Andreas Vesalius challenged Galenus' anatomical knowledge by performing dissections on human cadavers. These investigations allowed Vesalius to refute aspects of Galenus' anatomy. Among Galenus' major contributions to medicine were his work on the circulatory system. He was the first to notice that there was a distinct difference between venous (dark) and arterial blood. Although anatomical experiments on animal models led to a more comprehensive understanding of the circulatory system, nervous system, respiratory system, and other structures, his work contained scientific errors. One of Galenus' major works entitled On the Diagnosis and Healing of Passions of the Soul, discusses how to approach and treat psychological problems. This was the beginning of Galenus' efforts which were later referred to as psychotherapy. Her book contains instructions on how to give advice to those with psychological problems so that they can reveal their deepest passions and secrets, and ultimately cure them of mental illness. The leading individual, or therapist, who is usually a man, is older, wiser, and free from the control of passion or lust. This passion, according to Galenus, causes psychological problems experienced by a person. Galenus continued Hippocratic medicine during the Renaissance. He also proposed four humors (fluids) of the body, namely blood, yellow bile, black bile, and mucus. These four things will rotate according to the four seasons. He devised his own theories from these principles and much of his work was based on Hippocratic principles. His greatest work is the seventeen books of On the Use of the Parts of the Human Body. He also wrote on philosophy and anatomy. The theory put forward by Galenus was based on creation by a Creator (\"Nature\" or phusis) - the main reason why later Islamic and Christian scholars accepted his views.",

This proves that the world of medicine is heavily influenced by philosophical matters. The pneuma physicon (animal spirit) in the brain governs movement, perception, and the senses. The pneuma zoticon (living spirit) in the heart regulates blood and body temperature. The \"natural spirit\" in the liver regulates nutrition and metabolism. Galenus broadened his horizons by conducting research on animals. One of his methods was to perform surgery on a pig, cutting its laryngeal nerve (later part of this nerve became known as the Galenus Nerve) which stopped the pig from moaning. He also tied the ureters in living animals to show that urine was coming from the kidneys, and damaged nerves to show paralysis. The method of public appointments, as practiced by Galenus, is used as a way of learning for medical students and often creates debate. There are several theories of Galenus which proved to be true, such as his argument that the mind is in the brain, not in the heart, as stated by Aristotle. However, there are some theories as flawed as Galen's understanding of the circulatory system. He suspected that the venous and arterial systems were two separate systems. This theory was finally rejected by William Harvey in the 17th century. Because he uses animals as his experimental medium, there is a misunderstanding between animal organs and human organs. This is because not all organs are similar in every species. Medicine in medieval Arabia developed what had been discovered by ancient Greek scholars, including works by Galenus such as his humoral theory. Many of Galen's works written in Greek were translated into Syriac by Imam Nestor at the University of Gundishapur, Persia.",

Corrosion or rusting process is an electro chemical process. In the rusting process, iron (Fe) acts as a reducing agent and oxygen (O2) dissolved in water acts as an oxidizer. The equation for the reaction for rust formation is as follows: Anode: Fe(s) \u2192 Fe2+(aq) + 2e-Cathode: O2(g ) + 4H+(aq) + 4e- \u2192 2H2O(l) The rust formed on the metal will speed up the subsequent rusting process. Therefore, rust is also called an autocatalyst. The mechanism of corrosion is that iron metal which is far from the contact surface with air will be oxidized by Fe2+ ions. These ions dissolve in water droplets. The place where the oxidation reaction occurs at one end of the water drop is called the anode. The formed electrons move from the anode to the cathode through the metal. These electrons then reduce oxygen from the air and produce water. The end of the water drop where the reduction reaction occurs is called the cathode. Some of the oxygen from the air dissolves in water droplets and oxidizes Fe2+ to Fe3+ which forms iron rust (Fe2O3.H2O). Rusty iron or metal is brittle, dissolves easily, mixes with other metals, and is toxic. This is certainly dangerous and detrimental. If it rusts, the iron that is used as the foundation or support for the bridge becomes brittle so it easily collapses. Production equipment in the food and pharmaceutical industries may not use metals that corrode easily. This is because the rust that is formed easily dissolves in food, drugs, or the chemical compounds that are produced. Therefore, for industrial purposes usually use stainless steel equipment. Considerable losses due to the rusting process require efforts to prevent rust from occurring.",

While Shaykh Muhammad bin Salih Al Utsaimin added that this meaning would be perfect if added the negation of everything other than what is made one. In the Islamic concept, monotheism is a concept in the Islamic faith that states the oneness of God. Islam teaches that God is one (one) not in terms of number. Except in the sense that God has no partner or similar. God is one in terms of his essence, meaning that there is no essence similar to God's essence. Because the Essence of God is not a thing and is not characterized by the properties of things, because it is God who created all things and all their properties. God already existed before this entire creation existed. God cannot be imagined because the imagination of the human mind can only reach things that are usually found, seen, heard, or felt with the five senses. And God is not similar to such things. Practicing monotheism and avoiding polytheism is a consequence of the shahadat sentence that has been pledged by a Muslim. In rububiyyah monotheism, Allah is recognized as the only Rabb (the One who rules), so that everything other than Allah is 'abd (servant/slave/dominated). Allah is the Almighty Rabb in the creation, management, and government of the universe. Allah as the only Creator is also the One who gives sustenance, the One who gives life, the One who kills, as well as the One who gives benefits and harm. God takes care of everything; all matters He deals with are good; and God is Almighty over what He wills. The evidence is a verse in the Al-Qur'an, \"All creation and affairs belong to Him.\" Al-A'raf:54] God is also acknowledged to have the perfection of name and nature (nature of character and nature of action) in addition to creating, managing, and reigning over the universe; This is discussed in tauhid asma wa sifat (oneness of name and nature).",

Worship should not be directed at anything other than Allah. Worshiping other than Allah, even though worshiping Allah, is the greatest sin in Islam which is called shirk (associating with Allah), as mentioned in His word: Linguistically, tawhid means uniting, making one, or characterizing with unity. A Muslim believes that monotheism is the greatest principle of Islam and the greatest essence of Islam, and is one of the conditions for accepting good deeds in addition to being in accordance with the guidance of the Messenger of God. As for what is meant by conditions is anything that must be fulfilled before implementation and must reach the end of implementation. This is related to one's intention. If someone does something only for God, then the condition to be accepted is the intention because God must remain the same until the end.

The element was first synthesized in 2002 by a joint team of Russian and United States scientists at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, Russia. In December 2015, this element was designated as one of the four new elements by the Joint Working Party of IUPAC and IUPAP. The element's name was formalized on November 28, 2016. The element is named after nuclear physicist Yuri Oganessian, in keeping with the tradition of naming new elements after scientists. Yuri Oganessian is credited with discovering the heaviest elements on the periodic table. Oganesson is one of two elements named after people who were still alive at the time of the element's naming, the other being seaborgium. Oganesson has the highest atomic number and atomic mass of all known elements. The oganesson atom is radioactive and unstable; hence since 2005, only five (possibly six) 294Og atoms have been detected. As a result, very few of the properties of organesson can be investigated experimentally. The predictions of the properties of these elements were made through theoretical calculations, which discovered some surprising properties. For example, even though oganesson is a member of group VIIIA \u2013 the first synthetic element of this group which is often called the noble gas \u2013 it is possible that this element is quite reactive, unlike the other noble gas elements. Initially, organeson was thought to be a gas under normal conditions but now the element is predicted to be a metal due to relativistic effects. On the periodic table of elements, oganesson is included in the p-block elements and is the last element in the 7th period.

Bohr's and van Grosse's predictions were highly speculative, because the method of elemental synthesis was not known in 1922, and there was no theory of \"islands of stability\" for the heavy elements until 1965. The element was synthesized in 2002 (80 years after Bohr's prediction), and at that time its chemical properties had not been investigated so it was not known whether it really behaved like a noble gas as predicted. In late 1998, Polish physicist Robert Smola\u0144czuk wrote calculations on the fusion of atomic nuclei for the synthesis of superheavy atoms, including oganesons. According to his calculations, it was possible that oganesson could be prepared by fusing lead with krypton under tightly controlled conditions. He also predicts that the chance of this reaction occurring will be almost the same as the chance of a lead and chromium fusion reaction that previously succeeded in synthesizing element 106, seaborgium. This calculation contradicts previous predictions that the chances of a fusion reaction involving lead or bismuth would decrease exponentially as the atomic number of the products of the fusion reaction increased. In late 1998, researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory used Smola\u0144czuk's predictions and reported the discovery of the elements livermorium and oganesson in the journal Physical Review Letters, soon after these results were reported in the journal Science.

In 2011, the IUPAC evaluated the results of the collaboration of researchers Dubna and Livermore in 2006 and concluded: \"The three events reported for the isotope Z = 118 have very good internal redundancy, but without a known benchmark to the nucleus this does not meet the criteria for a discovery\" . Due to the very low probability of a fusion reaction (the fusion cross-section is ~0.3\u20130.6\u00a0bp or ((3\u20136)\u00d710\u221241\u00a0m2), the experiment took four months and involved a light dose of 2.5\u00d71019 calcium ions which must be fired at a californium target to produce the first recorded event believed to be oganesson synthesis.Nevertheless, the researchers are confident that the result is not a false positive, as the probability of such a detection occurring randomly was estimated to be less than 1 in 100,000.In these experiments, alpha decay of three atoms of oganesson was observed. It has been suggested that another atom decayed spontaneously. The half-life of oganesson-294 is 0.89 ms and the decay process is known: 294Og decays 290Lv via alpha decay.",

        "paragraph": "Since there are only three nuclei, the half-life calculated from this experiment has a large uncertainty, which is 0.89+1.07\u22120.31\u00a0ms. The identification of this nucleus as 294Og was verified by generating a 290Lv nucleus (which is known to be a decay product of 294Og) by bombarding 245Cm with 48Ca ions, and checking that the 290Lv decay produced in this way corresponds to the decay chain of the 294Og nucleus. This decay product is highly unstable, decaying with a half-life of 14 ms to 286Fl, which can undergo spontaneous fission or alpha decay to 282Cn, which will then undergo spontaneous fission. In the quantum tunneling model, the half-life of 294Og before alpha decay occurs is estimated to be 0.66+0.23\u22120.18\u00a0ms with experimental Q values \u200b\u200bpublished in 2004 Calculations with theoretical Q values \u200b\u200bfrom the Muntian-Hofman-Patyk-macroscopic-microscopic model Sobiczewski gives similar but slightly lower results. In December 2015, the Joint Working Group of the international scientific bodies International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) and International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) recognized the discovery of the element oganesson and named the collaborative project Dubna and Livermore as its discoverer. This determination was based on confirmation of the properties of 286Fl (the decay grandson of 294Og), at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and observations of another 294Og decay sequence by the Dubna group in 2012. The experiment was actually aimed at synthesizing 294Ts via the 249Bk(48Ca,3n) reaction, however, the short half-life of 249Bk causes many of these nuclei to decay to 249Cf, so that some of the synthesized products are converted to oganesson instead of all to tenesin. From October 1, 2015 to April 6, 2016, Dubna's team conducted a similar experiment using 48Ca to bombard californium with a mixture of 249Cf, 250Cf, and 251Cf, with the aim of producing the heavier oganesson isotopes 295Og and 296Og.",

Only one atom was observed at 252 MeV, whose decay chain matched that previously known from 294Og (ending in spontaneous fission of 286Fl), and none were seen at 258 MeV. The experiment was then terminated, because the adhesive from the sector frame covered the target and prevented any evaporation residue from passing to the detector. Dubna's team plans to repeat this experiment in 2017. Using Mendeleev's nomenclature for elements without a yet discovered name, oganesson is sometimes known as eka-radon (before the 1960s it was known as eka-emanation, since emanation was radon's old name). In 1979, the IUPAC adopted the (then undiscovered) systematic name ununoctium, with the symbol Uuo, and suggested this name was used until the element was discovered and confirmed. Although this name is widely used in the chemistry community at all levels, from chemistry class to advanced textbooks, the suggestion of this name is widely ignored among scientists in the field, who call it \"element 118\", with the symbols E118, (118), or even simply 118. Prior to the withdrawal of the experimental results in 2001, researchers from Berkeley intended to give the element the name ghiorcium (Gh), after Albert Ghiorso (one of the leaders of the research team). Russian researchers reported their synthesis in 2006. According to IUPAC recommendations, discoverers of new elements have the right to propose a name. In 2007, the head of the Russian institute stated that the team was considering two names for the new element: flyorium, in honor of Georgy Flyorov, founder of the research laboratory in Dubna; and moskovium, in recognition of the Moscow Oblast in which Dubna is located. He also stated that although the element was discovered in collaboration with the US team, which provided the californium target, the element should be named in honor of Russia as the Flerov Laboratory at JINR is the only facility in the world that can carry out this synthesis.",

However, in the end the name proposed for element 116 was instead livermorium, and the name moscovium was proposed and accepted for element 115 instead. Traditionally, the names of all noble gases end in \"-on\", except for helium, which was not recognized as a noble gas when it was discovered. The IUPAC guidelines in effect at the time of acceptance of oganesson's discovery required that all new elements be given the \"ium\" suffix, even if they turn out to be halogens (usually ending in \"-in\") or noble gases (which usually end in \"-on\"). Provisional name \"ununoctium\" \" follows this convention, but a new IUPAC recommendation published in 2016 suggests the \"-on\" suffix for the new elements from group 18 (VIIIA), regardless of whether those elements turn out to have noble gas-like chemical properties. In June 2016, the IUPAC announced that element 118's discoverers plan to name it oganesson (symbol: Og), in honor of Russian nuclear physicist Yuri Oganessian, a pioneer in research on superheavy elements who has been in the 60 years since the field's inception. and the technique he proposed were important factors in the synthesis of elements 106 to 118. The name was formalized on 28 November 2016. Oganessian then responded to the naming: For me, this is an honor.

        "paragraph": "The naming ceremony for moskovium, tenesin and oganesson was held on 2 March 2017 at the Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow. Nuclear stability is greatly reduced with increasing atomic number above 96 (curium atomic number, Cm). All isotopes with atomic numbers above 101 undergo radioactive decay with half-lives below 30 hours. No element with an atomic number above 82 (lead) has a stable isotope. This is due to the continued increase in the Coulomb repulsion between the protons in the nucleus, so that the strong nuclear force cannot hold back the tendency for spontaneous fission for long. If only this factor was taken into account, it should not be possible for elements with a proton number (atomic number) above 104. However, research conducted in the 1960s showed that a nuclear shell with around 114 protons and 184 neutrons could overcome the above instability factor, so the concept \"\" islands of stability\" in nuclear physics. In these \"islands\", atomic nuclei are thought to have half-lives reaching thousands or even millions of years. Although scientists have not yet reached this island, the presence of superheavy elements (including oganesson) indicates that this stabilizing effect is real, and the superheavy nuclei so far discovered show an exponential increase in half-lives as they approach this \"island\" position. Oganesone is radioactive and has a half-life that appears to be less than a millisecond. However, this figure is still higher than some predictions, so it is one piece of evidence to support the idea of \u200b\u200b\"islands of stability\". Calculations using the quantum tunneling model predict the existence of several neutron-rich isotopes of oganesson that have alpha half-lives close to 1 ms. Theoretical calculations of the synthetic pathway and the half-lives of other isotopes suggest that isotopes may be more stable than 294Og, especially 293Og, 295Og, 296Og, 297Og, 298Og, 300Og and 302Og.",

Still more neutron-rich isotopes, especially those around 313Og, can also produce long-lived nuclei. Because these long-lived heavy isotopes will greatly facilitate chemical research into oganesone, Dubna's team plans to conduct experiments during the second half of 2017 using a mixture of 249Cf, 250Cf, and 251Cf isotopes shot with 48Ca, with the aim of synthesizing the new isotopes 295Og and 296Og. ; then in 2020 similar research is planned to produce 297Og. This reaction can also produce 293Og and daughter 289Lv. The isotopes 295Og and 296Og can also be produced by fusion of 248Cm nuclei with 50Ti shot; these reactions are planned at JINR and at RIKEN in 2017\u20132018. Oganesson is a member of group 18 or VIIIA, elements without valence electrons. Group 18 members are usually inert in common chemical reactions (eg, combustion) because their outer valence shell is completely filled with electrons. This results in a stable energy minimum, with the outer electrons being tightly bound. Oganesson is thought to have the same property, and its outermost electron shell is completely filled with valence electrons of the 7s27p6 configuration. As a result, some researchers have predicted that oganesson has similar physical and chemical properties to members of group 18, especially radon, the noble gas immediately above this element in the periodic table. Following periodic trends, oganesson is expected to be slightly more reactive than radon. However, theoretical calculations show that this element could be much more reactive. In addition, oganesson may be even more reactive than the elements flerovium and copernisium, which are to the left of oganesson and below the more reactive elements lead and mercury.",

In addition, calculations also show that oganesson, unlike the other noble gases, binds electrons with the release of energy\u2013in other words, oganesson has a positive electron affinity,b] due to the relativistically stabilized 8s energy level and the relatively stable 7p3/2 energy level. reduced stability. Oganesson is thought to have had the greatest polarizability of all the elements before it was on the periodic table, nearly twice that of radon. By extrapolating from the other noble gases, it is estimated that oganesson has a boiling point between 320 and 380 K. This is very different from the previously estimated values \u200b\u200bof 263 K or 247 K. Even with great computational uncertainty, it seems highly unlikely that oganesson will be a gas under under standard conditions, and because the range of other liquids to gases is very narrow (between 2 and 9 kelvins), the element should be a solid under standard conditions. If oganesson forms a gas under standard conditions, however, it will be one of the densest gases at standard conditions, even if the gas is monatomic like the other noble gases. Because of its enormous polarizability, oganesson is thought to have an oddly low ionization energy (similar to lead which has about 70% ionization energy of radon and much less than that of flerovium) and is a condensed phase in the standard state. Although the structure of shells in the nucleus and electron cloud of oganesson is strongly influenced by relativistic effects: the main and valence electron subshells in oganesson are expected to be \"covered\" by a homogeneous Fermi gas of electrons, due to the very strong splitting of the 7p orbits in oganesson.",

No oganesson compounds have been synthesized, but calculations of theoretical compounds have been carried out since 1964. It was expected that if the ionization energy of the element was high enough, it would be difficult to oxidize it and therefore, the most common oxidation number is 0 (as with the other noble gases); However, this appears not to be the case. Calculations on the diatomic molecule Og2 show bond interactions roughly equivalent to those calculated for Hg2, and a dissociation energy of 6 kJ/mol, about 4 times that of Rn2. But what is most striking, after calculating this compound has a bond length that is 0.16 \u00c5 shorter than Rn2, which indicates a significant bond interaction. On the other hand, the compound OgH+ shows a dissociation energy (oganeson proton affinity) that is lower than RnH+. The bond between oganesson and hydrogen (OgH) is thought to be very weak and can be considered a pure van der Waals interaction and not a true chemical bond. On the other hand, with highly electronegative elements, oganesson seems to form more stable compounds than copernisium or flerovium. Stable oxidation states of +2 and +4 are expected in the fluorides OgF2 and OgF4. The +6 state is less stable due to the strong binding of the 7p1/2 subshell. This is a result of the same spin-orbit interaction that makes oganesson normally unreactive. For example, it was shown that the reaction of oganesone with F2 to form the compound OgF2 releases 106 kcal/mol of energy of which about 46 kcal/mol comes from this interaction. In comparison, the spin-orbit interaction for a similar molecule RnF2 is about 10 kcal/mol from a formation energy of 49 kcal/mol.",

Karaton Singhasari) or the Tumapel Kingdom, is a Hindu-Buddhist patterned kingdom founded by Ken Arok or also known as Ken Angrok in 1222. The history of this kingdom is closely related to the figure of Ken Angrok ( 1222\u20131247) who was the founder of Wangsa Rajasa as well as the Tumapel kingdom. The location of this kingdom is now estimated to be in the Singasari District, Malang Regency, East Java Province. Based on the information in the Kudadu Inscription, the official name of the Singhasari Kingdom is the Tumapel Kingdom. The name Tumapel also appears in Chinese news from the Yuan Dynasty with the spelling Tu-ma-pan. Kakawin Nagarakretagama clarified that the actual capital of Tumapel was called Kutaraja when it was first founded in 1222. In 1253, Wisnuwardhana changed the name of the royal capital to Singhasari. The name Singhasari, which is the name of the capital city, is even more famous than the name Tumapel. This is what makes Tumapel also better known as the Singasari Kingdom. Pararaton said Tumapel was originally just a subordinate area of \u200b\u200bthe Kadiri Kingdom. The person who served as Akuwu (equivalent to sub-district head) of Tumapel at that time was Tunggul Ametung. He was killed by means of deception by his own bodyguard, namely Ken Angrok, who later made himself the first king of Tumapel with the title Sri Ranggah Rajasa Bhatara Sang Amurwabhumi. Ken Angrok then married the widow, Tunggul Ametung, who was pregnant at the time, namely Ken Dedes. The son of Ken Dedes from Tunggul Ametung will later be named Anusapati. Besides being married to Ken Dedes, Ken Angrok has another wife named Ken Umang who later gave birth to a son named Tohjaya. When in power, Ken Angrok intended to free Tumapel from Kadiri's rule.

The discovery of the Mula Malurung Inscription on the other hand provides a different view from the Pararaton version, which has been known about the history of Tumapel. The inscription issued by Kertanagara in 1255 by order of Wisnuwardhana stated that Tumapel was founded by Rajasa, nicknamed \"Batara Shiva\", after conquering the Kadiri Kingdom. This name is probably the posthumous title of Ranggah Rajasa, because in Nagarakretagama the spirit of the founder of Tumapel is worshiped as Shiva. Apart from that, Pararaton also mentioned that Ken Angrok first used the nickname Batara Shiva before advancing in the war against Kadiri. The inscription also stated that the kingdom was then split into two after Ken Angrok's death, namely Tumapel led by Anusapati and Kadiri led by Mahesa Wong Ateleng alias Batara Parameswara. Parameswara was succeeded by Guningbhaya, then Tohjaya. Meanwhile, Anusapati was replaced by Seminary with the title Wisnuwardhana.

The most stable isotope, 232Th, has a half-life of 14.05 billion years, or about the age of the universe; this isotope decays very slowly through the process of alpha decay and begins a decay chain called the \"thorium series\" ending at the stable 208Pb. On Earth, thorium, bismuth and uranium are the three radioactive elements that still exist naturally in large quantities as primordial elements. a] It is estimated that thorium is three times more abundant than uranium in the Earth's crust. Thorium metal is primarily refined from monazite sand as a by-product of the extraction of rare earth metals. Thorium was discovered in 1828 by the Norwegian amateur mineralogist Morten Thrane Esmark and identified by the Swedish chemist J\u00f6ns Jacob Berzelius, who named it after Thor, the Norse god of thunder. Its first use was developed in the late 19th century. Thorium's radioactivity was widely recognized during the early decades of the 20th century. By the second half of this century, thorium had been supplanted for use in a variety of situations due to concerns about its radioactivity.

Pure thorium is very malleable, and like most metals, can be cold rolled, tempered, and shaped. At room temperature, thorium metal has a face-centered cubic crystal structure. It also has two other forms, one at high temperature (over 1360\u00b0C), which is body-centered cubic and another at high pressure (about 100 GPa), which is body-centered tetragonal. Thorium metal has a compression modulus (a measure of the resistance to compression of a material) of 54 GPa, about the same as tin (58.2 GPa). For comparison, the compression modulus of aluminum is 75.2 GPa; copper 137.8 GPa; and mild steel of 160-169 GPa. Thorium has the same hardness as mild steel, so when heated it can be rolled into sheets and drawn into wire. The density of thorium is nearly half that of uranium and plutonium. But it is harder than the two metals. Thorium becomes superconductive below 1.4 K. Thorium's melting point of 1,750\u00b0C is above that of actinium (1,227\u00b0C) and protactinium (1568\u00b0C). In the early elements of period 7, from francium to thorium, the melting points of the elements increase (as do elements in other periods).

Of the actinides up to californium, which can be studied in at least milligram amounts, thorium has the highest melting and boiling points and the second lowest density; only the element actinium is lighter than thorium. b] The boiling point of thorium is 4788\u00a0\u00b0C, the fifth highest boiling point of all known elements. c] The properties of thorium vary widely depending on the degree of impurity in the sample metal. The main impurity is usually thorium dioxide (ThO2); even the purest thorium specimens usually still contain the dioxide at a level of about one tenth of a percent (0.1%). Experimental measurements made to determine the specific gravity of thorium give a value of between 11.5 and 11.66 g/cm3: this value is slightly lower than the expected theoretical value of 11.7 g/cm3 (calculated from the lattice parameter thorium). This difference may be due to the microscopic cavities that form in the metal when it is printed. These values \u200b\u200bfall between the specific gravity values \u200b\u200bof the elements actinium (10.1 g/cm3) and protactinium (15.4 g/cm3) which are adjacent to thorium. Thorium can be formed into alloys with other metals. The addition of a small amount of thorium to magnesium increases the mechanical strength of the metal. Additionally thorium-aluminium alloying is being considered as a way to store thorium in a proposed future thorium nuclear reactor.",

Except for two elements, technetium (element 43) and promethium (element 61), all the elements up to bismuth (element 83) have one practically stable isotope. Meanwhile, polonium (element 84) and all other elements are radioactive. 232Th is one of three nuclides other than bismuth (the other two being 235U and 238U) that have a half-life of billions of years; its half-life is 14.05 billion years, about three times the age of the earth and slightly older than the age of the universe. About eighty percent of the thorium that existed at the time of Earth's formation has survived to this day. 232Th is the only thorium isotope that exists in sufficient quantities in nature. Its stability is due to its closed nuclear shell which has 142 neutrons. Thorium has a characteristic isotopic composition of Earth, with an atomic weight of 232.0377(4). Thorium is one of four radioactive elements (along with bismuth, protactinium, and uranium) that are abundant enough on Earth for a standard atomic weight to be determined. Thorium nuclei are susceptible to alpha decay because their strong nuclear forces cannot overcome the electromagnetic repulsion between their protons. The alpha decay of 232Th begins a 4n decay chain involving isotopes with mass numbers that are multiples of 4 (also called the thorium series after the names of the elements). This successive series of alpha and beta decays starts from the decay of 232Th to 228Ra and ends at 208Pb. All samples of thorium metal and its compounds will contain traces of these decay daughters, namely isotopes of thallium, lead, bismuth, polonium, radon, radium, and actinium. Natural thorium samples can be chemically purified to extract useful daughter nuclides, such as 212Pb, which is used in nuclear medicine for cancer therapy.",

Evidence of this event is left in the thorium minerals (as xenon gas which is trapped and formed by the fission products). But the partial half-life of this process is very large over 1021 years and alpha decay dominates instead. There are thirty radioisotopes of thorium that have been characterized, from mass numbers 209 to 238. After 232Th, the most stable (based on half-life) are 230Th with a half-life of 75,380 years, 229Th with a half-life of 7,340 years, 228Th with a half-life of 1.92 years, 234th with a half-life of 24.10 days, and 227th with a half-life of 18.68 days. All of these isotopes occur in nature as trace radioisotopes due to their presence in the decay chains 232Th, 235U, 238U, and 237Np: the latter have long been extinct in nature due to their short half-lives (2.14 million years), but are continuously produced. in trace amounts due to the capture of neutrons in uranium ore. The other isotopes of thorium have half-lives of less than 30 days and most of them less than 10 minutes. In the deep ocean, the isotope 230Th accounts for up to 0.04% of natural thorium. This is caused by the parent 238U which is soluble in water but 230Th is insoluble and precipitates into the sediment. Uranium ores with low concentrations of thorium can be refined to produce gram-sized samples of thorium that are more than a quarter of the 230Th isotope, because 230Th is one of the decay daughters of 238U.

This energy is so low that when undergoing isomeric transitions, the gamma radiation emitted is in the ultraviolet range. d] Different isotopes of thorium have the same chemical properties but slightly different physical properties: for example, densities of 228Th, 229Th, 230Th, and pure 232Th were 11.5, 11.6, 11.6 and 11.7 g/cm3, respectively. The 229Th isotope is predicted to undergo fission with a solid critical mass of 2839 kg, although with a steel reflector this value drops to 994 kg. There are two radiometric dating methods involving thorium isotopes, namely the uranium\u2013thorium dating which is based on the decay of 234U to 230Th, and the ionium\u2013thorium dating which measures the ratio of 232Th to 230Th. f] Both methods are based on the fact that 232Th is an ancient radioisotope and 230Th only appears as an intermediate product in the 238U decay chain. Uranium\u2013thorium dating is a relatively short-term process because of the short half-lives of 234U and 230Th relative to the age of the Earth.

This concurrent process is often used to check uranium\u2013thorium dating results. Uranium\u2013thorium dating is commonly used to date calcium carbonate materials such as speleothems and coral reefs because uranium is more soluble than thorium and protactinium, so these elements selectively precipitate into marine sediments.",

Ionium\u2013thorium dating is a similar process, measuring the ratio of 232Th to 230Th in marine sediments. Both of these dating methods make the basic assumptions that the proportion of 230Th to 232Th was constant during the period in which the sedimentary layer formed, that the sediment did not contain thorium before the uranium decayed, and that thorium could not migrate within the sedimentary layer. A thorium atom has 90 electrons; 4 of these electrons are valence electrons. There are three atomic orbitals that are theoretically available for valence electrons to occupy, namely the 5f, 6d, and 7s orbitals. Although thorium is located in the f-block of the periodic table, it has an unusual ground state electron configuration, Rn]6d27s2. In the early actinide elements, the energies of the 5f and 6d subshells of elements are very close; in thorium the 6d subshell is lower energy than the 5f subshell. This is because the 5f subshell is destabilized and not well shielded by the filled 6s and 6p subshells. This is due to the stronger relativistic effects on the lower elements in the periodic table, especially the effects of spin\u2013orbit interactions. The proximity of the 5f, 6d, and 7s energies to thorium causes it to give up all four of its valence electrons almost always and so it is in the +4 oxidation state. This is in contrast to cerium, the lanthanide sibling of thorium, which although it can exist in the +4 oxidation state, its +3 oxidation state plays an important role and is more stable. The chemical properties of thorium are more similar to those of transition metals such as zirconium and hafnium than to cerium in terms of ionization energy and redox potential. This transition-metallic behavior is a normal trend in the early half of the actinide element series.",

A theoretical metallic state of thorium having the configuration Rn]6d27s2 with its 5f orbital above the Fermi level should be hexagonally packed tightly packed like the group 4 elements titanium, zirconium and hafnium. However, the observed structure of thorium is actually a face-centered cubic structure. This observed crystal structure can be explained when the 5f thorium state of the orbital is involved. Thorium tetravalent compounds are usually colorless or yellow in color. This is because the Th4+ ion does not have 5f or 6d electrons. The chemical properties of thorium are therefore dominated by its electropositivity in the form of a diamagnetic ion with a noble gas configuration. g] Thorium and uranium are the most studied radioactive elements because their radioactivity is low enough that special handling is not required in the laboratory. Thorium is a highly reactive and electropositive metal. The standard reduction potential of thorium is \u22121.90 V for the Th4+/Th pair, Thorium is slightly more electropositive than zirconium or aluminum. The finely divided thorium metal is pyrophoric and can ignite spontaneously in air. When heated in air, thorium crumbs ignite and burn to give off a bright white light, forming the compound thorium dioxide. In lump form, pure thorium reacts slowly in air, although corrosion may occur after several months. Most thorium samples were slightly contaminated with thorium dioxide. This contamination accelerates the corrosion process. Thorium samples like these will tarnish slowly; the surface becomes gray and finally black. At standard temperature and pressure, thorium is slowly attacked by water, but quickly dissolves in most acids, except in aqueous hydrochloric acid, which leaves an insoluble residue ThO(OH,Cl)H.

Thorium dioxide is a refractory material with the highest melting point (3390\u00b0C) of all known oxides. Thorium dioxide is slightly hygroscopic and reacts with water and various gases; it dissolves in concentrated nitric acid when fluoride ions are present in the solution. When heated in air, thorium dioxide emits a bright blue light. This light turns white when thorium dioxide is mixed with cerium dioxide (CeO2). Mixtures of these two compounds were formerly commonly used in lampshades to produce bright white light. The flames are not needed to get this bright light. In 1910, it was discovered that a hot Welsbach lamp shroud (made of ThO2 with 1% CeO2) retained its full radiance when exposed to a mixture of burning gas and air. The light emitted by thorium dioxide has a much higher wavelength than would be expected from the black body emission of an afterglow at the same temperature; this effect is referred to as kandoluminescence. This happens because ThO2 : Ce acts as a catalyst for the recombination of free radicals that appear in high temperature flames. This free radical de-excitation generates a large amount of energy. Addition of 1% cerium dioxide to the lampshade enhances this effect by increasing the emissivity of the material in the visible region of the spectrum; Cerium, unlike thorium, can exist in a variety of different oxidation states. Therefore, the charge and emissivity of visible light depends on the area in which it is found in the flame.

This compound has a distorted square antiprism geometry. In contrast, other thorium tetrahalide compounds (chlorides, bromides, and iodides) have a dodecahedral geometry. In addition, thorium was found to be able to combine in low valence with bromides (ThBr2 and ThBr3) and iodides (ThI2 and ThI3).

Depending on the coordination number, this ion has a radius from 0.95 to 1.14 \u00c5. This ion is quite acidic due to its high charge. Its acidity is slightly stronger than that of sulfite, so it tends to hydrolyze and polymerize to Th2(OH)2]6+ in solutions with a pH of 3 or less. In more alkaline solutions, the polymerization process continues until a gelatinous Th(OH)4 is formed and then precipitates. As a hard Lewis acid, Th4+ prefers a hard ligand that has an oxygen atom as a donor. Complex compounds with ligands with sulfur atoms as donors are less stable and therefore more susceptible to hydrolysis. High coordination numbers are very common for thorium coordination compounds because of the large size of thorium.

Thorium is created in the cores of dying stars by the r-process and is scattered throughout the galaxy by supernovae and colliding neutron stars. The \"r\" in the r-process comes from the phrase \"rapid neutron capture\". This catch occurs inside a core-collapse supernova, where a heavy seed nucleus like 56Fe rapidly captures neutrons against the line of neutron droplets; The captured neutron faster than the speed of the nuclide undergoes beta decay to become a stable nuclide. Capture of neutrons is the only way stars can synthesize elements heavier than iron. This is because there is an increase in the Coulomb barrier which makes interactions between charged particles more difficult for atoms with high atomic numbers. In fact, the fusion reactions of atoms heavier than 56Fe are endothermic. Because the stability of the nuclide is lost suddenly when it reaches 209Bi, the r-process is the only process in stellar nucleosynthesis that can create the elements thorium and uranium; other processes are too slow and the intermediate nuclei formed undergo alpha decay before capturing enough neutrons to become the elements thorium and uranium.

In the Earth's crust, thorium is more abundant with an abundance of 8.1 parts per million (ppm). Thorium is one of the most abundant heavy elements. It is close to that of lead (13 ppm) and more abundant than tin (2.1 ppm). This is because thorium tends to form oxide minerals that do not sink into the Earth's core; it is classified as a lithophile. Thorium compounds are also generally less soluble in water. Therefore, although the refractory metal elements have similar relative abundances on Earth and in the Solar System, thorium is more prevalent in the Earth's crust than the other heavy platinum group metals. Almost all thorium found in nature is usually the 232Th isotope. This isotope is the longest-lived and most stable isotope of thorium. Its half-life is proportional to the age of the universe. The heat generated from the radioactive decay of this isotope contributes most to the Earth's internal heat; other geothermal contributors involve short-lived primordial radionuclides, such as 238U, 40K, and 235U respectively.

Thorium was the second element to be radioactive, after uranium whose radioactivity was discovered by French physicist Henri Becquerel in 1896. Starting in 1899, New Zealand physicist Ernest Rutherford and American electrical engineer Robert Bowie Owens began studying the radiation produced by thorium. Preliminary observations indicated that the radiation of thorium varied significantly. The two determined that this variation was due to the short-lived, gaseous daughter of the thorium core. The core child was later discovered as a new element and is now called radon. Radon is the only rare radioactive element found in nature as a daughter nucleus of thorium rather than uranium. After considering the contributions of radon, Rutherford, later working under the British physicist Frederick Soddy, showed in 1900\u20131903 how thorium decays at a steady rate over time into a series of other elements.

Before it was banned, 10,000 people in the United States had been injected with thorium while undergoing diagnostic X-rays; they were later found to suffer from health problems such as leukemia and abnormal chromosomes. Public interest in radioactivity declined in the late 1930s.

In 1892, British chemist Henry Bassett postulated the existence of additional period rows below the lanthanides to accommodate both known and undiscovered elements. Henry Bassett considered thorium and uranium to be analogous to the lanthanide elements. In 1913, the Danish physicist Niels Bohr published a theoretical model of the atom and its electron orbitals. This model quickly gained wide acceptance. According to this model, the 7th period elements of the periodic table must have their f-shell completely filled before the d-shell is filled, as is the case with the lanthanide elements of the 6th period that precede the 5d transition metals. The existence of a series of transition elements in these two (actinide elements) was not widely accepted until the electron structure of the lanthanide elements was determined. Bohr suggested that the 5f orbital may not be filled first in elements after uranium.",

The chemical similarity of the actinide starting elements to the transition metals is now considered to be an exception rather than a continuing trend in properties. In 1945, American physicist Glenn T. Seaborg and members of his research team discovered the transuranium elements americium and curium. Seaborg came up with the actinide concept after realizing that thorium is a 2nd member of the f-block actinide element series, analogous to the lanthanide elements than to hafnium in the d-block 4th period. taking advantage of the radioactivity properties decreased drastically due to concerns for the safety and environmental impact of torum; this was also accompanied by the discovery of safer substitutes for thorium. Although radioactive, thorium is still used in a variety of applications for which an alternative to thorium has not been found. In a 1981 study by the United States' Oak Ridge National Laboratory, it was estimated that wearing a thorium lamp shirt every weekend was safe for a person. However, this is not safe for the T-shirt manufacturing workers nor for the soil environment where the T-shirt factory is located. Some jersey manufacturers have changed the jersey material, for example with yttrium. As of 2007, several companies were still manufacturing and selling thorium lampshades without adequate notification of the product's radioactivity. Some companies even falsely claim that their products are not radioactive. Thorium has been used as an energy source on a prototype scale. The first thorium-based reactor was built at the Indian Point Energy Center in Buchanan, New York, United States in 1962.",

In the 1950s, the government of India aimed at achieving energy self-sufficiency through India's three-stage nuclear power program, the third phase of which was the construction of a thorium nuclear reactor. In most countries, uranium is relatively more abundant than thorium, so progress on thorium-based reactors in other countries has been slow. Large-scale research was started in 1996 by the International Atomic Energy Agency to study the use of thorium reactors; a year later, the United States Department of Energy began their research. In the 21st century, thorium's potential to reduce nuclear proliferation and its waste characteristics led to a renewed interest in the thorium fuel cycle. The Government of India is projecting to achieve 30% of electricity consumption using thorium by 2050. In February 2014, the Bhabha Atomic Research Center in Mumbai, India showcased their latest \"next-generation nuclear reactor\" design using thorium as the reactor fuel core, named \"Advanced Heavy Water Reactor\" (AWHR) or advanced heavy water reactor. The head of the Indian Atomic Energy Commission said in 2009 that India has a long term goal of becoming energy self-sufficient using India's thorium-rich mineral resources.\" When gram quantities of plutonium were first produced at the Manhattan Project, it was discovered that the minor isotope 240Pu underwent significant spontaneous fission This brought into question the feasibility of plutonium-fired gun-type nuclear weapons. To avoid this problem, the Los Alamos research team began designing implosion-type weapons. At the same time, the Chicago research team was also discussing solving the problem using a new reactor design. Eugene Wigner proposed using the 240Pu contaminated plutonium to promote the transmutation of thorium to 233U in a special converter reactor.",

Advances in the design of the Los Alamos implosion-type weapon prevented development of the converter reactor from proceeding. But the design of this reactor has a strong influence on the development of further nuclear energy. In the design, there is a detailed description of the use of a high-level water-cooled and moderated reactor similar to ship reactors and later power plant reactors. During the Cold War, the United States considered the possibility of using 232Th as a source of 233U for use in nuclear bombs. The US government launched a test bomb in 1955. From the results of the bomb tests, it was concluded that the 233U bomb was moderately potent, but lacked a sustainable \"technical advantage\" over contemporary uranium\u2013plutonium bombs. This is mainly because 233U is difficult to produce in its pure isotope state. Thorium metal is used in the United States' W71 nuclear weapon hohlraum. Low demand for thorium makes it unprofitable to develop dedicated thorium extraction mines. Because of this, thorium is almost always extracted together with other rare earth metals. These rare earth metals can also be a by-product of the production of other minerals. Most of the world's thorium is produced as a by-product of the extraction of the mineral monazite. Other mineral sources such as thorite contain more thorium and can be extracted for thorium if demand increases. Little is known about the distribution of thorium resources in the world today because the low demand for thorium has made thorium exploration efforts rare. In 2014, world production of monazite concentrate, from which thorium can be extracted, was 2700 tonnes. Thorium production lines generally involve concentrating the mineral thorium, extracting the thorium from the concentrate, and refining the thorium.",

There are two categories of minerals in the thorium concentration process, namely primary minerals and secondary minerals. Primary mineral deposits are found in granite acid magmas and pegmatites. Both concentrate monazite locally, but are small in size. Secondary mineral deposits are found in river estuaries in granite mountainous areas. In these deposits, thorium is enriched along with other heavy metal minerals. The initial concentration of thorium in minerals varies depending on the type of deposit. For primary deposits, pegmatite, which is usually obtained from mining, is ground into small pieces, then flotation. Alkaline earth metal carbonates in minerals are separated by reaction with hydrogen chloride. This is then followed by coagulation, filtering and calcination processes. The result is a concentrate with a rare earth metal content that can reach 90%. For secondary deposits, the sands obtained are first separated through gravity, then separated using a magnet in stages (from low-strength magnets to high-strength magnets). Monazite produced from this method can reach up to 98% purity. The industrial extraction of thorium in the 20th century relied on treating the monazite concentrate with hot concentrated sulfuric acid in a vessel made of cast iron. This is then followed by a selective precipitation process after dilution with water. The success of this method depends on the specification and grain size of the concentrate. Therefore, there are also many other alternative methods that have been proposed, but only one has been proven to be effective and economical, namely the treatment of the concentrate with hot sodium hydroxide solution. This method is slightly more expensive than the hot concentrated sulfuric acid treatment method, but it can produce higher purity thorium metal; In particular, this method is capable of separating phosphate compounds from concentrates.",

The process is two-step and involves the use of up to 93% concentrated sulfuric acid at 210\u2013230 \u00b0C. First, concentrated sulfate origin in an amount >60% by mass of concentrate is added and heated in the crucible, followed by the addition of monazite sand. Because the concentrate dissolving process is exothermic, monazite sand added to the acid must be done slowly. This causes the reaction mixture to thicken to a slurry state and then solidify as the reaction products are formed. In the second stage, excess fuming sulfuric acid is then added to the mixture and the mixture temperature is held constant (210\u2013230 \u00b0C) for more than 5 hours. The concentration of sulfuric acid used affects the reaction rate and the viscosity of the mixture. The reaction rate and viscosity increase with increasing concentration of sulfuric acid used. However, excessive viscosity of the reaction mixture can inhibit the reaction rate. Increasing the reaction temperature can also be used to increase the reaction rate, but temperatures over 300 \u00b0C should be avoided as this will lead to the formation of insoluble thorium pyrophosphate. Conversely, if the temperature is less than 200 \u00b0C, the reaction proceeds slowly and becomes impractical. In order to avoid the formation of precipitates that cover the surface of the monazite sand, the mass of acid used must be twice as much as the mass of the sand. After the digestion process is complete, the reaction mixture is cooled to 70\u00b0C and diluted with cold water in an amount of 10 times the volume of the mixture. The resulting salts of thorium and other rare earth metals will dissolve into the water, while the unreacted remains of monazite sand settle to the bottom of the container.

Temperatures that are too high must be avoided because they will lead to the formation of insoluble thorium oxide and uranium oxide in the filtrate. In addition, too low a base concentration will also slow down the reaction rate. Due to the relatively mild reaction conditions, the monazite sand used in the extraction must have a particle size below 45 \u03bcm. The reaction mixture was then filtered and the solid filter results obtained contained a mixture of rare earth metal hydroxides, thorium hydroxide, and sodium diuranate, while the filtrate solution obtained contained trisodium phosphate. This trisodium phosphate can crystallize as decahydrate crystals when the solution is cooled below 60\u00b0C. The solid hydroxide mixture obtained was then dissolved in 37% hydrochloric acid solution at 80 \u00b0C. The insoluble portions were filtered out, and the filtrate obtained was precipitated using 47% sodium hydroxide solution. Thorium and uranium compounds precipitate at a pH of 5.8, while other rare earth metals precipitate at a higher pH. The precipitated thorium and uranium compounds are then dissolved in nitric acid for further separation. The precipitate from both acid and base extraction must be further purified so that it can be used in various nuclear applications. Previously, purification of thorium was accomplished by repeated dissolution and recrystallization.

Most uses of thorium unrelated to its radioactivity have declined since the 1950s. This was due to concerns about the environmental impact of thorium's radioactivity and its decay products. Thorium is mostly used in the form of thorium dioxide rather than in the pure metal form. The compound thorium dioxide has a melting point of 3300\u00b0C (6000\u00b0F), which is the highest of all known oxide compounds. This causes these compounds to remain solid in the flame. In addition, thorium dioxide also increases the brightness of the fire. These properties are the reason for the use of thorium dioxide in lampshades. All compounds will emit energy (glow) at high temperatures, but the light emitted by thorium is almost all included in the visible light spectrum, so it appears brighter. Although still common, the use of thorium dioxide in lamp jerseys has been slowly replaced by yttrium since the late 1990's. In the production of tungsten incandescent lamp filaments, the recrystallization of tungsten can be significantly reduced by adding small amounts of thorium dioxide to the tungsten sintered powder. The addition of small amounts of thorium dioxide to the hot tungsten cathode significantly decreases the work function of the electrons. As a consequence, electrons are emitted at a much lower temperature. Thorium forms a one-atom thick layer that covers the surface of the tungsten. The work function of the thorium surface decreases possibly due to the formation of an electric field at the thorium and tungsten interface caused by the greater electropositivity of thorium. Since the 1920's, thoracic tungsten wire has been used in electronic tubes as well as the cathode and anti-cathode in X-ray tubes and rectifiers.",

The invention of the transistor in the 1950s led to a significant decline in the use of thorium for this purpose. Thorium dioxide is also used in gas tungsten arc welding (abbreviated GTAW) to increase the strength of tungsten electrodes and arc stability at high temperatures. The use of thorium dioxide for this purpose has gradually been replaced by other oxide compounds, such as the oxides of zirconium, cerium, and lanthanum. Thorium dioxide is also used in heat-resistant ceramic materials, for example in laboratory crucibles. Thorium dioxide can be used as the main ingredient in ceramics or as an additive to zirconium dioxide. An alloy of 90% platinum and 10% thorium is an effective catalyst in the oxidation of ammonia into various nitrogen oxide compounds. However, it has been replaced by an alloy of 95% platinum and 5% rhodium because of its better mechanical properties and durability. When added to glass, thorium dioxide helps increase the index of refraction and decrease glass dispersion. Such glasses are used as high-quality lenses in cameras and scientific instruments. The radiation produced by these lenses can cause them to slowly turn yellow, although the health impact is minimal. The yellowed lens can be returned to its original state by exposing the lens to ultraviolet radiation. Thorium dioxide has been superseded for this purpose by other rare earth oxides. Thorium tetrafluoride is used as an anti-reflection agent in coated optical coatings. Thorium tetrafluoride is transparent to electromagnetic waves with a wavelength between 0.35\u201312 \u00b5m.

Substitute thorium tetrafluoride for this purpose has been under development since 2010. The main source of nuclear power in a nuclear reactor is the fission reaction of a nuclide induced by neutrons. Synthetic fissile materials, such as nuclei 233U and 239Pu, can be propagated through neutron capture by nuclides 232Th and 238U, both of which occur in nature. 235U which occurs in nature is also fissile.n] In the thorium fuel cycle, the fertile isotope 232Th is bombarded by slow neutrons and undergoes neutron capture to become 233Th. This isotope then undergoes beta decay twice to become 233Pa and then 233U: 233U is fissile and can be used as a nuclear fuel like 235U and 239Pu. When 233U undergoes nuclear fission, the neutrons it emits can slam into further 232Th nuclei, thus continuing the cycle. This cycle is paralleled to the uranium fuel cycle in a fast breeder reactor where the 238U undergoes neutron capture to become 239U. 239U then beta decays to 239Np and then to fissile 239Pu. The advantage of using thorium is that it is more abundant than uranium, allowing it to meet the world's energy demands over a longer period of time. In addition, 232Th absorbs neutrons more easily than 238U. The 233U it produces also has a greater probability of undergoing fission (92%) than 235U (85.5%) or 239Pu (73.5%) when struck by a neutron. On average, more neutrons are generated from 233U fission. A neutron capture by 238U produces transuranium waste along with a 239Pu fissile nucleus, but the same neutron capture by 232Th will only produce waste after five captures, resulting in 237Np waste.",

For this reason, thorium is an alternative fuel that has the potential to replace uranium in MOX (mixed oxide fuel) fuels to minimize the generation of transuranium core waste and maximize the destruction of plutonium. The use of thorium fuel results in better performance as well as the safety of the reactor core because thorium dioxide has a higher melting point, higher thermal conductivity and lower coefficient of thermal expansion. It is also chemically more stable than the uranium dioxide currently commonly used. This is because uranium dioxide can be oxidized to triuranium octoxide (U3O8) which substantially reduces its density. Thorium fuel that has been used up is both difficult and dangerous to reprocess because it produces a lot of 232Th and 233U nuclei which are strong gamma emitters. All 233U nuclei production methods will produce 232U impurities, either from parasitic (n,2n) 232Th, 233Pa, and 233U reactions which result in the release of a neutron, or from double neutron capture by 230Th which is an impurity found in natural 232Th: 232U itself is not that dangerous, but it quickly decays into the nucleus of 208Tl which is a strong emitter of gamma rays (232Th also follows the same decay chain, but its half-life is very long, so the amount of 208Tl produced is negligible). These impurities in the form of 232U make 233U both easily detected and dangerous to handle. Moreover, it is impractical to separate the two.

Instead of 233Pa decaying rapidly into useful 233U, most of it consumes neutrons and turns into 234U. As a result, the efficiency of the reactor is reduced. To avoid this, 233Pa is extracted out of the active zone of the thorium molten salt reactor during operation, so that there is no chance for 233Pa to capture neutrons and instead it will only decay to 233U. Before the benefits of using thorium can be realized, the technology for the 232Th irradiation process with neutrons and their advanced processing needs to be further developed. This requires further technological advances than those in the uranium and plutonium fuel cycles. Research is still being carried out to develop this technology. In addition, there are also opinions that the thorium fuel cycle does not have proper economy. The World Nuclear Association predicts that the thorium fuel cycle will not be economically viable as long as uranium is available in abundance. Natural thorium decays very slowly compared to other radioactive materials. It emits alpha radiation which cannot penetrate human skin. It is therefore considered safe to handle small amounts of thorium, such as in light socks, even though using them can be risky. Exposure to thorium aerosols, such as dust contaminated with thorium, can result in an increased risk of lung, pancreatic and blood cancers. This is caused by alpha radiation which is able to penetrate the internal organs. Internal exposure to thorium can also increase the risk of liver disease. The decay products of 232Th are mainly radium and radon. Both are more dangerous radionuclides.

Most of the radiation consumers are exposed to comes from inhalation of radium. It is estimated that the radiation dose is 0.2 milisievert per use.

Although the radiation dose from a single lampstock is not a problem, it becomes problematic when the lampstocks are collected together in large quantities, as occurs in a lampshade manufacturing plant or in a landfill. Thorium is odorless and tasteless. The chemical toxicity of thorium is low because thorium and most of its compounds (such as dioxide) do not dissolve well in water. It will precipitate out of solution as thorium hydroxide before entering the body. Some thorium compounds are moderately toxic, especially when strong complex-forming ions such as citrate are present which are capable of bringing thorium into the body in a dissolved form. If a thorium lamp t-shirt is chewed or inhaled, approximately 0.4% of the thorium and 90% of children will essentially be released from the shirt.

The average human contains 40 micrograms of thorium and generally consumes 3 micrograms of thorium daily. Most exposure to thorium occurs through inhalation of dust; some types of thorium also enter through food and drink. Due to its low solubility in water, exposure through food and drink is negligible. Exposure levels are increased for people living near thorium deposits, nuclear waste dumps, uranium, phosphate, and lead processing plants, and for people who work in thorium lamp jersey factories.

To create a caricature for The New York Review of Books, Levine first reviewed the outline of the article to be illustrated, along with a photograph of the character the magazine had asked him to caricature. The New York Times described Levine's caricatures as \"big-headed, glum in expression, sharply probing, and hardly ever flattering\". .

However, how these characteristics are exaggerated often depends on each caricaturist's drawing style. As reviewed by Susan E. Brennan, caricatures begin to make their caricatures with generalized anatomical models of facial proportions. Many caricaturists have several photographs of public figures to create their caricatures and always use more than one photo. The caricaturist can also study a number of photographs of his subject and then draw from memory. Several attempts have been made to create caricatures automatically or semi-automatically using computer graphics techniques. For example, Susan E. Brennan created a software to create interactive caricatures. In the system he designed, caricatures were created by comparing two images; a picture of the person's face to be caricatured and the face of the person who is considered average. Then, the first face is caricatured by adding the differences between the images. A number of computerized caricature creation systems further developed Brennan's method. In addition, there are also a number of other systems that try to learn how caricatures make their caricatures by applying artificial intelligence or statistical techniques. Other systems rely on input from the user regarding facial features that need to be caricatured, thus demanding user skills. The use of caricatures in facial recognition and facial perception has been studied in the fields of cognitive psychology, visual perception, computer vision, and pattern recognition. Research shows that exaggerated images of faces\u2014using a computerized caricature creation system such as those mentioned above\u2014are generally more recognizable than photographs of the person.

Because encryption has been used to secure communications in many countries, only certain organizations and individuals who have a very pressing need for confidentiality use encryption. In the mid-1970s, strong encryption was used for security by the Secretariat agency of the United States government in the public domain. Today, encryption is used in a wide variety of systems, such as the Internet, e-commerce, mobile telephone networks, and bank ATMs. Encryption can be used for security purposes. However, other techniques are still needed to create secure communications, especially to ensure the integrity and authentication of a message, for example message authentication code (MAC) or digital signature. Another use is to protect against analysis of computer networks. One of the oldest forms of encryption in history and still simple is encryption using the Caesar Cipher algorithm, in which this method uses the exchange of letter characters in the plaintext to become exactly one character in the ciphertext. In 1790, Thomas Jefferson devised a method for encoding and decoding messages using a special device in the form of a lettered disc known as the Jefferson disk which consisted of 36 cylindrical pieces of wood. During the Second World War, the shaft block used a more complex encoder than the Jefferson disk, which was called the Enigma machine. Until now, encryption is used, one of which is to protect information on intellectual property rights of someone who can at any time face the possibility of data theft. An encryption is an algorithm for performing encryption and its reverse (decryption), that is, a series of steps that are arranged and followed as a procedure.

Encryption usually has special information in encrypting which is known as a key - it is a collection of bits presented in binary, decimal or hexadecimal form. Encryption procedures vary greatly depending on the key that will change the details of the algorithm's operation. Without using the key, encryption cannot be performed. In non-technical usage, a secret code is the same thing as a password. However, technically, codes and ciphers are two different concepts. The code works at the comprehension level, i.e. words or phrases. Passwords (encryptions) work at a lower level, namely the level of letters, groups of letters, or bits in modern cryptography. Cryptography was introduced by the Egyptians 4000 years ago by using non-standard hieroglyphs to write messages. Historically, cryptography has been divided into code and cipher dichotomies. The code has a weakness against cryptographic analysis and difficulty in managing complex lists of codes. Hence, codes fell out of use in modern cryptography and encryption became a more dominant technique. There are lots of different types of encryption. The algorithms used in the early history of cryptography were very different from modern methods. Modern ciphers are classified according to how they work and use one or two keys. Encryption with pen and paper (manual) in the past is called classical cryptography. Substitution ciphers and transposition ciphers are included in this encoding. In the early 20th century, more sophisticated machines, rotor machines, were used for more complex encryption.

In order for an organism to become a fossil, the remains of this organism must soon be buried in sediment. Paleontologists classify fossils into several types. Animals or plants that are thought to be extinct but in fact still exist are called living fossils. The most common fossils are skeletal remains such as shells, teeth and bones. Soft tissue fossils are very rare. The science that studies fossils is paleontology, which is also a branch of science embraced by archeology. Fossilization is the process of hoarding the remains of animals or plants that accumulate in sediments or deposits that are either completely preserved, partially or only in traces. There are several conditions for fossilization to occur, including: The term \"living fossil\" is a term used for a living species that resembles a species known only from fossils. Some of the living fossils include coelacanth fish and ginkgo trees. A living fossil can also refer to a living species that has no other close species or a small group of close species that does not have any other close species. An example of this last criterion is nautilus. Most fossils are found in open-surface sedimentary rocks. Rocks that contain many fossils are called fossiliferous. The types of fossils contained in rocks depend on the type of environment in which the sediments were scientifically deposited. Marine sediments, from coastlines and shallow seas, usually contain the most fossils. Fossils are formed from the process of destroying remains of organisms that once lived.

Even if two objects with high similarity appeared together, they should be different. For example, if you rotate an equilateral triangle about its center by 120 degrees, the triangle will appear the same as before the rotation. In Euclidean Geometry, this rotation results in an unrecognized change. In fact, each corner of an equilateral triangle modeled as a molecule exhibits a different symmetrical behavior. The object with the most symmetry is empty space because each part can be rotated, reflected or translated without changing. The most common type of symmetry is left-right or mirror image symmetry which is symbolized by T:. this symbol is used to reflect along the vertical axis. An equilateral triangle exhibits three axes of reflection symmetry, and a rotational symmetry. Rotating the triangle about the center of the triangle by 120 or 240 degrees shows no change. An object that only exhibits rotational symmetry behavior but does not have reflection symmetry is the swastika. Examples of wikipedia symmetry (similarity obtained by shifting one line down and two spaces to the right), and translational symmetry of two forms: (similarity obtained by shifting three positions to the right, or one line down and two positions to the right; until similarity is obtained for three lines down). In both cases it is neither mirror-image nor rotational symmetry. Felix Klein, the German geometer, gave a very influential statement in the Erlangen program in 1872, symmetry as a combination and organization of principles in geometry.

Structures into triangles can be created by repeating the scale of the symmetry operation several times. An example from mathematics that expresses symmetry is a2c + 3ab + b2c. If a and b are changed, the expression shows no change in the commutative property for addition and multiplication. In mathematics, a study of the symmetry of objects by collecting all operations that result in the object not changing. These operations form a group. For geometric objects, this is known as a symmetry group; for algebraic objects, the term automorphism group is used. In fact, at the end of the 20th century, group was synonymous with group transformation (con: group action). Only during the early 20th century were definitions of groups without reference to group action. A dyadic relationship R is symmetric if and if, while true for Wed, is true for Rba.

If we have a set of objects with multiple structures, then it is possible for a symmetry to convert one object to another.

There is dispute as to the actual age of the stone circles, but most archaeologists estimate that they were erected between 3,000 BC and 2,000 BC. In 2008, radiocarbon dating showed that the first stones were erected between 2400 and 2200 BC. While other theories indicate that the blue stone (bluestone) was founded around 3,000 BC. The mound of earth and the circular moat around it are markers of the early stages of the construction of the monument. The dating of these features is around 3,100 BC. The Stonehenge site and its surroundings were added to the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 1986 along with Avebury Henge. Stonehenge comes from the words Stone and Henge. Stone means stone, while Henge means circle. Archaeologists define a henge as a circular earthen wall with a moat inside. By the early 20th century, most of the stones were no longer standing straight. This is probably due to the large number of tourists who climbed Stonehenge around the 19th century because of their great curiosity.

Stonehenge's north-eastern entrance was widened at this time to align with the midsummer rising sun and midwinter setting sun.

As Baruna's vehicle, makara also has the connotation of a mysterious sea creature whose various aspects cannot be understood by ordinary humans. Makara is also known as the vehicle for Goddess Ganga, the personification of the sacred river Ganges. Although Goddess Ganga is portrayed as a compassionate figure in Indian literature, the river Ganges itself often brings floods that destroy human habitation and is inhabited by many crocodiles that were feared by the people of ancient India. Entering the 2nd century BC, makara was also associated as a symbol of Pradyumna, the son of Basudewa Kresna who was one of the manifestations of Krishna. One of Pradyumna's titles found in the Hariwangsa book is Makaradhwaja which roughly means \"he with the Makara banner\". In several passages of the Mahabharata, Makara is associated with Pradyumna as well as Kamadewa, suggesting that the two are the same character. In Hindu astrology, makara is also one of the constellations that is equivalent to the zodiac Capricorn and the name of the month in the Indian Hindu calendar. There is a visual continuity between the makara and the capricornus, which in a number of descriptions is often described as a mixed animal whose hindquarters have a fish body like the makara. The use of makara as an architectural ornamental motif has ancient roots in Indian tradition. In Hindu temples, makara is used as a sculptural motif that adorns reliefs, column heads, doorways, stair rails, gutters and various other parts of buildings.",

        "paragraph": "A theory is a series of interrelated parts or variables, definitions and propositions that present a systematic view of phenomena by determining the relationships between variables, with the intention of explaining natural phenomena. Labovitz and Hagedorn define theory as the idea of \u200b\u200b\"theoretical thinking\" which they define as \"determining\" how and why variables and relationship statements can be related to each other. The word theory has different meanings in different fields of knowledge depending on the methodology and the context of the discussion. In general, theory is an analysis of the relationship between one fact and another in a set of facts. Also, unlike a theorem, a theory statement is generally only accepted on a \"provisional\" basis and is not a conclusive final statement. This indicates that the theory comes from drawing conclusions that have the potential for error, in contrast to drawing conclusions from mathematical proofs. Meanwhile, more specifically in the social sciences, there is also social theory. Neuman defines social theory as a system of related abstractions or ideas that summarize and organize knowledge about the social world. It should be noted that theory is different from ideology, a researcher is sometimes biased in distinguishing between theory and ideology. There are similarities between the two, but they are clearly different. Theory can be part of ideology, but ideology is not theory. An example is Human alienation is a theory expressed by Karl Marx, but Marxism or Communism as a whole is an ideology. In science, theory in science means a model or framework that explains natural phenomena or certain social phenomena. Theories are formulated, developed, and evaluated according to the scientific method. Theory is also a hypothesis that has been proven true. Humans develop theories to explain, predict, and control certain phenomena (for example, inanimate objects, natural events, or animal behavior).",

A theory makes generalizations of many observations and consists of a coherent and interrelated set of ideas. The term theoretical can be used to describe something that is predicted by a theory but has never been observed. For example, until recently, black holes were categorized as theoretical because they were predicted according to the general theory of relativity but had never been observed in nature. There is a misconception that states that if a scientific theory has enough evidence and has been tested by other researchers, it will become a scientific law. This is not true because the definitions of scientific laws and scientific theories are different. Theories will remain theories, and laws will remain laws. In a theory there are several elements that follow it. This element serves to unify the variables contained in the theory. The first element is the concept. A concept is an idea expressed by a symbol or word. The concept is divided into two, namely, symbols and definitions. In natural science, concepts can be expressed with symbols such as, \"\u221e\" = infinity, \"m\" = Mass, and others. However, in most social sciences this concept is expressed more in words and not through symbols. According to Neuman, words are also symbols because language itself is a symbol. Because learning concepts and theories is like learning a language. Concepts are everywhere and we always use them. For example, let's talk about education. Education is a concept, it is an abstract idea that exists only in our minds. The second element is Scope. In theory as described above have a concept.",

The rock layers that characterize the beginning and end of this period are well identified, but the exact dates are uncertain between 5 and 10 million years. The Jurassic is the middle period of the Mesozoic era, also known as the \"Age of the Dinosaurs\". The beginning of this period is marked by the Triassic-Jurassic extinction event. The period's name was given by Alexandre Brogniart based on the abundance of marine limestone found in the Jura Mountains, at the confluence of Germany, France and Switzerland where the limestone strata of the period were first identified. By the early Jurassic, the supercontinent Pangea had begun to divide into two large landmasses: Laurasia to the north, and Gondwana to the south. This created more coastlines and changed the continent's previously arid climate to a humid one. And many of the deserts that existed in the Triassic Period were replaced by lush rainforests. Dinosaurs were the dominant animals in the Jurassic, ending with a minor extinction event. The Jurassic period is divided into three parts: Early, Middle, and Late. Likewise, in stratigraphy, the Jurassic period is divided into Lower Jurassic, Middle Jurassic, and Upper Jurassic based on rock formations. The division of the term Jurassic into three parts comes from Leopold von Buch. The Jurassic ranks from oldest to youngest are: During the early Jurassic period, the supercontinent Pangea broke up into the supercontinents Laurasia and Gondwana; The Gulf of Mexico is open due to a rift with North America; so that it is now known as the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula in Mexico.

Meanwhile, records of the Jurassic period in North America are scant. Although the epicontinental Sundance Sea left marine deposits on the northern plains of the United States and Canada during the late Jurassic, the most exposed sediments from this period are the continents themselves. Several large batholiths exist in the North American Cordillera starting in the mid-Jurassic period, marking the Nevadan orogeny. Important discoveries about the Jurassic period were also found in Russia, India, South America, Japan, Australasia, and England. In Africa, the Early Jurassic strata are distributed similarly to the Late Triassic strata, with outcrops being more common in the south and less common fossil beds being dominated by a northerly pathway. As the Jurassic period continued, larger and more iconic groups of dinosaurs such as sauropods and ornithopods proliferated in Africa. Middle Jurassic strata are not well represented or well studied in Africa. Late Jurassic strata are also underrepresented apart from the spectacular Tendaguru Formation in Tanzania. Late Jurassic life is very similar to that found in western North America's Morrison Formation.

This tree refers to several species, such as Protium copal, Hymenaea courbaril, Hymenaea verrucosa, Bursera coyucensis, Agathis dammara, and so on. The copal tree is found in tropical areas and each species is usually endemic to its area. Hymenaea courbaril has a more specific designation, namely the Brazilian copal tree, while Hymenaea verrucosa has the Zanzibar copal tree designation, and Agathis dammara is called the resin tree. Kopal has long been known in Central American cultures, such as the Aztecs and Mayans. The origin of the name \"kopal\" comes from the local language which means \"incense\" or \"high\". Copal contains resinol acids, resins and essential oils. Its use is as an adhesive in dental fillings and plaster, a mixture of lacquer and varnish. Copal oil is obtained by distillation and is used as a perfume blend. Kopal is often considered as or used as a substitute for resin, and made into rings. Protium copal can grow up to 30 m tall and has long, leathery leaves. The inside of the wood is brown or reddish brown. The wood has low resistance so it is easily attacked by fungi and termites. The texture varies from smooth to quite rough. This copal tree belongs to the Angiospermae group, so the seeds are covered in flesh. The fruit is small (2\u20133 cm) and soft. The resin tree (Agathis dammara) found in Indonesia can grow up to 65 m. The diameter of this tree can reach more than 1.5 m.

Another species of copal endemic to Mexico is Bursera coyucensis, in the western lowlands of Balsas, on the border of the states of Guerrero and Michoacan. Both of these species come from the same family, namely Burseraceae. The Brazilian copal tree is found in the Caribbean, Central America and South America, while the Zanzibar copal tree is native to East Africa. In Indonesia, there is an endemic tree capable of producing copal, namely resin (Agathis dammara). Damar spread in Maluku, Sulawesi, to the Philippines. The copal produced is referred to as \u201cManila copal\u201d. Apart from Agathis dammara, there are other Agathis, such as Agathis australis which produces copal called \"kopal Kauri\", as well as several other Agathis spread throughout Indonesia. Copal production per tree is influenced by factors such as site quality, tree age, stand density, genetic characteristics, height at growth site, bark thickness, stem diameter, topography, crown quality, and tapping direction. Copal flow during tapping is influenced by several factors such as species, conditions and place of growth, tree diameter, number of hugs in one tree, interval of hug renewal, tapping time, and treatment of the surface of the tapping wound. In Agathis trees, tree diameter has a significant effect on copal yield where the bigger the stem, the higher the copal production. Damar (Agathis dammara) has a different ability to produce copal.

The average copal yield of thin-skinned trees is 4.004 g/tree while those with thick-skinned trees is 35.542 g/tree. For the copal tree, the sap is of course the main product. Copal sap is produced by the trunk of a tree. Apart from the stem, copal can also be obtained from the seed coat and leaves, but the extraction process is more difficult. Kopal has different characteristics, depending on the tree that produces it. Copal, which is hard and amber in color, is a cheaper version of kopal. Copal, which is white, hard, sticky, and has a milky texture, is more expensive. Hard copal extracted from trees in Africa has an anime designation, for example the copal produced by the Zanzibar copal tree. Real copal will not dissolve in an 80% chloralhydrate solution, while other gums will. Hard and soft varieties are distinguished by treatment using boiling water. After an hour and a half in boiling water, hard copal will show no change, while soft copal becomes opaque and milky. The Indonesian Ministry of Trade in 1977 divided copal into four grades based on their quality, starting from class I to class IV. Perhutani divides copal quality into Main Quality (U) and First Quality (P). One of the uses of copal latex is as a varnish. Varnish is a liquid whose composition is composed of resin oil, solvents, pigments, drying agents, additives, or additional ingredients which when applied to a material surface can form a dry, hard and adhesive layer on the surface. In Indonesia, experiments have been carried out to make varnish using Probolinggo copal and Sukabumi copal. The standard used in determining the quality of varnish is the ICI standard.",

        "paragraph": "Enzymes are biomolecules in the form of proteins that function as catalysts (compounds that speed up the reaction process without being finished reacting) in an organic chemical reaction. Enzymes function as biocatalysts of a chemical reaction. The energy required by enzymes in chemical reactions is very small so that it functions to lower the activation energy. The initial molecule called the substrate will be accelerated to change into another molecule called the product. All biological processes of the cell require enzymes in order to proceed quickly enough in a certain direction of metabolic pathway. Enzymes work by reacting with substrate molecules to produce intermediate compounds through an organic chemical reaction that requires a lower activation energy, so that the acceleration of chemical reactions occurs because chemical reactions with higher activation energies take longer. For example: Although the catalyst compound may change in the initial reaction, in the final reaction the catalyst molecule will return to its original shape. Most enzymes work uniquely, which means that each type of enzyme can only work on one type of chemical compound or reaction. This is due to differences in the chemical structure of each enzyme which is fixed. For example, the \u03b1-amylase enzyme can only be used in the process of breaking down starch into glucose. Enzyme work is influenced by several factors, especially the substrate, temperature, acidity, cofactors and inhibitors. Each enzyme requires a different optimum temperature and pH (acidity level) because enzymes are proteins, which can change shape if the temperature and acidity change. Outside the appropriate temperature or pH, enzymes cannot work optimally or their structure will be damaged. This will cause the enzyme to lose its function completely. Enzyme work is also influenced by other molecules. Inhibitors are molecules that decrease enzyme activity, while activators are those that increase enzyme activity.",

At least in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, several processes involving enzymes were known, namely the digestion of meat by gastric secretions and the breakdown of starch into sugars by plant extracts and saliva. However, the mechanisms by which these processes occur have not been identified. French chemist Anselme Payen was the first scientist to discover an enzyme, namely diastase, in 1833. Decades later, Louis Pasteur, who was researching the fermentation of sugar into alcohol using yeast, wrote that this fermentation reaction was caused by a \"vital force\" contained in yeast cells, referred to as \"ferment\", according to which it only functions in the body of living organisms. He wrote that \"alcoholic fermentation is an action related to the life and order of the yeast cells, and not to their death or decay.\" In 1878, the German physiologist Wilhelm K\u00fchne (1837\u20131900) first used the term \"enzyme\", which comes from the Greek \u03b5\u03bd\u03b6\u03c5\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd meaning \"in leavening agent\" or \"in yeast\", to describe this process. The word \"enzyme\" (enzyme) was later used to refer to inanimate substances such as pepsin, and the word ferment was used to refer to chemical activities produced by living organisms. In 1897, Eduard Buchner began his series of scientific papers on yeast extract. In experiments at the University of Berlin, he found that the fermentation of sugar by yeast extract continued even if there were no surviving yeast cells in the mixture. He named the enzyme that triggers this fermentation of sucrose \"zymase\" (zimase). In 1907, he received the Nobel Prize in chemistry for \"discovering cellless fermentation\".

The discovery that enzymes can work outside living cells has prompted research into their biochemical properties, but the chemical identity of enzymes is unknown. Some scientists have found that the activity of enzymes is related to proteins, but some scientists (such as Nobel laureate Richard Willst\u00e4tter) have argued that proteins themselves are incapable of catalysis and only act as carriers for enzymes. However, in 1926, James B. Sumner managed to crystallize the enzyme urease and demonstrated that this enzyme is pure protein. He later did the same with the enzyme catalase in 1937. US biochemists John Howard Northrop and Wendell Meredith Stanley definitively demonstrated that pure proteins could become enzymes, through their studies of digestive enzymes, namely pepsin (1930), trypsin, and chymotrypsin. Sumner, Northrop, and Wendel won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1946. With the success of enzyme crystallization, the structure of the enzyme can then be described by the X-ray crystallographic method. It was first applied to lysozyme, an enzyme found in tears, saliva, and egg whites, that can break down the protective coating of some bacteria. The structure of this enzyme was deciphered by a group of scientists chaired by David Chilton Phillips and the results were published in 1965. This detailed structure of lysozyme marked the beginning of the field of structural biology as well as the beginning of efforts to understand how enzymes work at the atomic level. Enzyme names are often derived from the name of the substrate or the chemical reaction they catalyze, being a name ending in -ase.

In addition, the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (IUBMB) has developed a nomenclature for enzymes, which is referred to as EC number (EC stands for Enzyme Commission). In this nomenclature, the name of the enzyme begins with \"EC\" and is followed by four numbers that indicate the class of reaction catalyzed by the enzyme. The first number indicates the top-level grouping (based on the most common similarities), which are then subdivided into smaller and more specific groups, based on the substrate, product (result of the reaction), or chemical mechanism. For example, hexokinase is EC 2.7.1.1, where EC 2 indicates that the enzyme belongs to the transferase group, EC 2.7 indicates that the reaction it catalyzes adds a phosphate group, EC 2.7.1 indicates that the phosphate acceptor molecule (i.e. hexose) has an alcohol group, and then EC 2.7.1.1 showed the complete hexokinase enzyme. The first number ranges from EC 1 to EC 6, namely: Naming with the EC system does not indicate the similarity of the amino acid sequence in the enzyme protein. For example, two ligases with the same EC number indicate that they catalyze the same reaction, but may have completely different amino acid chains. Some protein databases, such as Pfam, have different groupings based on similarity of amino acid sequences, resulting in groups of proteins that are different from groupings based on enzyme-catalyzed chemical reactions.

Enzymes range in size from only 62 amino acids (4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase monomer), to over 2,500 (fatty acid synthase). Enzymes are generally much larger than their substrates, and only a small part (about 3\u20134 amino acids) of the overall enzyme structure is directly involved in catalysis; this part is called the catalytic site. Near the catalytic site are one or more bonding sites whose amino acids serve to direct the orientation of the substrate molecule. The combination of the catalytic site and the binding site is called the active site. The rest of the enzyme functions to maintain the precise orientation and dynamics of the active site. In some enzymes, no amino acids are directly involved in catalysis, but the enzymes do have sites for binding and directing cofactors, which are then involved in catalysis. Some enzymes also have allosteric sites, which can bind to a small molecule causing a conformational change that can increase or decrease activity. There are also small numbers of RNA catalysts, the most common being the ribosome; These types of enzymes are referred to as RNA-enzymes or ribozymes. :2.2 Enzymes are usually very specific as to the reactions they catalyze as well as to the substrates involved in the reactions. The shape, charge and hydrophilic/hydrophobic characteristics of enzymes and substrates are responsible for this specificity. Enzymes can also exhibit very high levels of stereospecificity, regioselectivity and chemoselectivity. Some of the enzymes showing the highest accuracy and specificity are involved in genome copying and expression. These enzymes have a \"check back system\" mechanism.

The same mechanism can also be found in RNA polymerase, aminoacyl tRNA synthetase and ribosomes. Some enzymes that produce secondary metabolites are said to be \"non-selective\", that is, they can act on many different types of substrates. It is proposed that this broad substrate specificity is critical to the evolution of new biosynthetic pathways. Enzymes are very specific. In 1894, Emil Fischer proposed that this was because both the enzyme and the substrate had complementary geometric shapes. This is often referred to as the \"Lock and Lock\" model. While this model explains enzyme specificity, it fails to account for the stabilization of the transition state achieved by enzymes. This model has been shown to be inaccurate, and it is the induced precision model that is currently the most widely accepted. In 1958, Daniel Koshland proposed a modification of the lock and lock model: because enzymes have a flexible structure, the active site is constantly changing its shape according to the interactions between the enzyme and the substrate. Consequently, the substrate does not bind to the rigid active site. The orientation of the amino acid side chains changes according to the substrate and allows the enzyme to carry out its catalytic function. In some cases, such as glycosidases, the substrate molecule also changes slightly when it enters the active site. The active site will continue to change shape until the substrate is completely bound, at which point the final shape and charge of the enzyme are determined. Enzymes can work in a number of ways, all of which decrease \u0394G\u2021: Understanding the origins of decreasing \u0394G\u2021 requires knowing how enzymes can produce transition state reactions that are more stable than the stability of transition state reactions without a catalyst.",

Such an environment does not exist in uncatalyzed reactions in water. The internal dynamics of an enzyme is related to the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme. Enzyme internal dynamics is the movement of structural parts of the enzyme, for example a single amino acid residue, a group of amino acids, or even an entire protein domain. These movements occur on various time scales, ranging from a few femtoseconds to several seconds. Networks of protein residues throughout the enzyme structure can contribute to catalysis through dynamic motion. Protein movement is vital, but whether fast or slow vibrations or large or small conformational movements are more important depends on the type of reaction involved. However, although this motion is important in terms of the binding and release of substrates and products, it is not clear if it helps speed up the reaction steps of these enzymatic reactions. These disclosures also have far-reaching implications for the understanding of allosteric effects and the development of new drugs. Allosteric enzymes change their structure according to their effector. This modulation can occur directly, in which the effector binds directly to the binding site of the enzyme, or indirectly, in which the effector binds to a protein or other protein subunit that interacts with the allosteric enzyme, thereby affecting its catalytic activity. Some enzymes do not require additional components to reach their full activity. But some also require non-protein molecules called cofactors to bind to enzymes and become active. Cofactors can be inorganic substances (eg metal ions) or organic substances (eg flavin and heme). The cofactor can be a prosthetic group that binds tightly, or a coenzyme, which disengages from the active site of the enzyme during the reaction.",

However, organic prosthetic groups can also be covalently bonded (eg thiamine pyrophosphate in the enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase). The term holoenzyme can also be used to refer to enzymes that contain multiple protein subunits, such as DNA polymerase. In this case, the holoenzyme is a complete complex containing all the subunits necessary for it to be active. An example of an enzyme that contains a cofactor is carbonic anhydrase, in which the zinc cofactor is bound as part of its active site. Coenzymes are cofactors which are small organic molecules that transport chemical groups or electrons from one enzyme to another. Examples of coenzymes include NADH, NADPH and adenosine triphosphate. The chemical groups carried include the hydride ion (H\u2013) carried by NAD or NADP+, the acetyl group carried by coenzyme A, formyl, methenyl, or methyl groups carried by folic acid, and the methyl group carried by S-adenosylmethionine. Several coenzymes such as riboflavin, thiamine, and folic acid are vitamins. Because coenzymes are chemically changed by the action of the enzyme, it is safe to say that they are either specific substrates, or secondary substrates. For example, about 700 enzymes are known to use the coenzyme NADH. Regeneration as well as maintenance of coenzyme concentration occurs within the cell. For example, NADPH is regenerated via the pentose phosphate pathway, and S-adenosylmethionine via methionine adenosyltransferase. As catalysts, enzymes do not change the equilibrium position of a chemical reaction. Usually the reaction will proceed in the same direction as the uncatalyzed reaction. The difference is, enzymatic reactions run faster. However, in the absence of enzymes, possible side reactions can occur and produce different products.",

        "paragraph": "Furthermore, enzymes can combine two or more reactions, so that a thermodynamically favorable reaction can be used to drive a thermodynamically unfavorable reaction. For example, the hydrolysis of ATP often uses other chemical reactions to drive the reaction. Enzymes catalyze the forward and reverse reactions in a balanced way. Enzymes do not change the equilibrium of the reaction itself, but only speed up the reaction. For example, carbonic anhydrase catalyzes the reaction in both directions depending on the concentration of the reactants. However, if the equilibrium strongly favors one direction of reaction, that is, the reaction is highly exergonic, the reaction will be irreversible. Under these conditions, enzymes will only catalyze reactions that are thermodynamically permissible. Enzyme kinetics investigates how enzymes bind to substrates by turning them into products. The rate data used in the kinetic analysis was obtained from the enzyme assay. In 1902, Victor Henri proposed a quantitative theory of enzyme kinetics, but his experimental data were useless because attention to the concentration of hydrogen ions was not focused at that time. After Peter Lauritz S\u00f8rensen defined the logarithmic pH scale and introduced the concept of buffering in 1909, the German chemist Leonor Michaelis and his Canadian postdoctoral fellow, Maud Leonora Menten, repeated Henri's experiments and confirmed Henri's equations. This equation became known as Henri-Michaelis-Menten kinetics (sometimes also just called Michaelis-Menten kinetics). Their work was further developed by G. E. Briggs and J. B. S. Haldane. The derivation of the kinetic equations derived by them is still in widespread use today. One of Henri's major contributions to enzyme kinetics was viewing enzyme reactions as two steps. In the first step, the substrate binds reversibly to the enzyme, forming an enzyme-substrate complex.",

        "paragraph": "This complex is sometimes referred to as the Michaelis complex. Enzymes then catalyze chemical reactions and release products. Enzymes can catalyze reactions at speeds reaching millions of reactions per second. For example, in the absence of enzymes, the reaction catalyzed by the enzyme orothidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase would take 78 million years to convert 50% of the substrate to products. However, when the enzyme is added, this process only takes 25 milliseconds. The rate of reaction depends on the conditions of the solution and the concentration of the substrate. Conditions that cause protein denaturation such as high temperatures, high salt concentrations, and too high or too low pH values \u200b\u200bwill eliminate enzyme activity. While increasing the concentration of the substrate tends to increase its activity. To determine the maximum rate of an enzymatic reaction, the substrate concentration is increased until a constant rate of product formation is observed. This is indicated by the saturation curve on the side. Saturation occurs because as the substrate concentration increases, more and more free enzymes are converted into ES substrate-enzyme complexes. At the maximum rate (Vmax), all the active sites of the enzyme bind to the substrate, and the amount of ES complexes equals the total amount of enzyme present. However, Vmax is only one of the kinetic constants of the enzyme. The amount of substrate required to achieve a certain rate of reaction is also important. This is expressed by the Michaelis-Menten constant (Km), which is the substrate concentration required by an enzyme to reach half its maximum speed. Each enzyme has a different Km value for a substrate, and this can indicate how strong the substrate binds to the enzyme. Another useful constant is kcat, which is the number of substrate molecules that can be handled by one active site per second. The efficiency of an enzyme is expressed by kcat/Km.",

        "paragraph": "It is also called the specificity constant and includes the rate constants for all the reaction steps. Because the specificity constant reflects catalytic ability and affinity, it can be used to compare one enzyme with another, or the same enzyme with different substrates. The maximum theoretical specificity constant is called the diffusion limit and its value is about 108 to 109 (M\u22121 s\u22121). At this point, any collisions of the enzyme with its substrate will cause catalysis, and the rate of product formation is not limited by the rate of reaction, but by the rate of diffusion. Enzymes with these properties are said to be catalytically perfect or kinetically perfect. Examples of enzymes that have this property are carbonic anhydrase, acetylcholinesterase, catalase, fumarase, \u03b2-lactamase, and superoxide dismutase. Michaelis-Menten kinetics relies on the law of mass action, which is derived on the assumptions of free diffusion and thermodynamically driven random growth. However, many biochemical and cellular processes deviate from this ideal condition, caused by macromolecular crowding, enzyme/substrate/product phase separation, and one- or two-dimensional molecular movements. In this situation, fractal Michaelis-Menten kinetics can be applied. Some enzymes operate with kinetics that are faster than the rate of diffusion. This seems highly improbable. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain this phenomenon. Some proteins are believed to accelerate catalysis by attracting their substrates and pre-orienting the substrates using a dipolar electric field. Other models use a quantum mechanical tunneling explanation, although this explanation is controversial. Quantum tunneling for protons has been observed in tryptamine. Enzyme reaction rates can be reduced using various types of enzyme inhibitors. In competitive inhibition, the inhibitor and substrate compete for binding to the enzyme. Often competitive inhibitors are very similar in structure to the native substrate of the enzyme.",

        "paragraph": "For example, methotrexate is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase. The similarity between the structure of folic acid and this drug is shown in the picture below. Note that inhibitor binding need not occur at the substrate binding site if inhibitor binding changes the conformation of the enzyme, thereby blocking substrate binding. In competitive inhibition, the maximum reaction rate does not change, but a higher substrate concentration is required to achieve this maximum rate, thereby increasing Km. In uncompetitive inhibition, the inhibitor cannot bind to the free enzyme, but only to the ES complex. The EIS complex that is formed then becomes inactive. This type of inhibition is very rare, but can occur with multimeric enzymes. Non-competitive inhibitors can bind to the enzyme at the same time the substrate is binding to the enzyme. Both the EI and EIS complexes are inactive. Since the inhibitor cannot be counteracted by increasing the substrate concentration, the Vmax of the reaction changes. However, because the substrate can still bind to the enzyme, the K remains the same. This type of inhibition is similar to non-competitive inhibition, except that the EIS complex has residual enzymatic activity. In many organisms, inhibitors can be part of a feedback mechanism. If an enzyme produces too many products, the product can act as an inhibitor for that enzyme. This will cause product production to slow down or stop. This form of feedback is negative feedback. Enzymes with this form of regulation are often multimeric and have allosteric binding sites. The substrate/enzyme rate curve is not hyperbolic but S-shaped. Irreversible inhibitors react with enzymes and form adducts with proteins. This inactivation is irreversible. Such inhibitors include efloritina, a drug used to treat disease caused by the African protozoa trypanosomiasis.",

        "paragraph": "Penicillin and Aspirin also work in the same way. These drug compounds bind to the active site, and the enzyme then converts the inhibitor into an active form that reacts irreversibly with one or more amino acid residues. Because inhibitors inhibit enzyme function, they are often used as drugs. An example is the inhibitor used as a drug aspirin. Aspirin inhibits the COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes that produce the inflammatory messenger prostaglandin, so it can suppress inflammation and pain. However, many other enzyme inhibitors are toxic. For example, cyanide, which is an irreversible enzyme inhibitor, will combine with copper and iron at the active site of the enzyme cytochrome c oxidase and block cell respiration. Enzymes have various biological functions in living organisms. Enzymes play a role in signal transduction and cell regulation, often through kinase and phosphatase enzymes. Enzymes also play a role in producing body movements, with myosin hydrolyzing ATP to produce muscle contractions. Other ATPases in the cell membrane are generally ion pumps involved in active transport. Enzymes are also involved in characteristic functions, such as the light-producing luciferase in fireflies. Viruses also contain enzymes that can attack cells, such as HIV integrase and reverse transcriptase. One of the important functions of enzymes is in the digestive system of animals. Enzymes such as amylase and protease break down large molecules (such as starch and protein) into smaller molecules, so they can be absorbed by the intestines. Starch molecules, for example, are too large to be absorbed by the intestines, but enzymes hydrolyze the starch chains into smaller molecules such as maltose, which are further hydrolyzed to glucose, so that it can be absorbed. Different enzymes digest different food substances.",

        "paragraph": "In ruminants, microorganisms in the animal's stomach produce cellulase enzymes that can break down plant cellulose wall cells. Several enzymes can work together in a certain order, and produce metabolic pathways. In the pathway of metabolism, one enzyme will carry the product of another enzyme as a substrate. After the catalytic reaction occurs, the product is then delivered to other enzymes. Sometimes more than one enzyme can catalyze the same reaction simultaneously. Enzymes determine what steps occur in this metabolic pathway. Without enzymes, metabolism would not proceed at an orderly pace, nor would it proceed fast enough to meet the needs of the cell. And in fact, metabolic pathways such as glycolysis would not be possible without enzymes. Glucose, for example, can react directly with ATP, and become phosphorylated on its carbons at random. Without the presence of enzymes, this process proceeds very slowly. However, when hexokinase is added, the reaction continues, but the phosphorylation at carbon 6 occurs very rapidly, such that the product glucose-6-phosphate is found to be the predominant product. Therefore, the network of metabolic pathways in each cell depends on the set of functional enzymes present in the cell. There are five main ways in which enzyme activity is controlled in cells. Since tight control of enzyme activity is required to maintain homeostasis, a malfunction (mutation, overproduction, underproduction or deletion) of a single important enzyme can lead to genetic diseases. The importance of enzymes is demonstrated by the fact that deadly diseases can be caused by the malfunction of just one enzyme out of the thousands present in our body. One example is phenylketonuria. Mutations of a single amino acid in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase which catalyzes the first step of phenylalanine degradation result in the accumulation of phenylalanine and related compounds.",

Its physical form is a DNA sequence that is attached to/in a protein, polypeptide, or an RNA strand that has a function for the organism that has it. The modern definition of a gene is a specific location in the genome that is associated with inheritance and may be associated with functioning as a regulator, target of transcription, or other functional roles. The colloquial use of \"gene\" (eg \"intelligent gene\" or \"hair color gene\") often refers to alleles: the choice of variations available by a gene. Although the expression of alleles can be similar, people more often use the term allele for phenotypically different gene expression. Genes are symbolized by letters. The dominant gene uses capital letters while the recessive gene uses lowercase letters. Gregor Mendel has speculated about the existence of a material associated with a trait or character in an individual's body that can be passed on from one generation to the next. He called them 'factors'. By Hugo de Vries, he called a similar concept pangen (read: \"pan-gen\") in his book Intracellular Pangenesis (published in 1889). Having not read Mendel's writings, de Vries defined pangen as \"the smallest particle representing a single inherited trait\". Wilhelm Johannsen abbreviated it as gene twenty years later. In 1910, Thomas Hunt Morgan showed that genes are located on chromosomes. Next, there is an exciting 'race' to find the substance which is a gene. Many of the Nobel Prizes have since gone to researchers involved in this subject. At that time DNA had been discovered and it was known that it was only in chromosomes (1869), but people had not yet realized that DNA was related to genes. Through Oswald Avery's research on Pneumococcus bacteria (1943), and Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase (publication 1953) on the T2 bacteriophage virus, only then did people know that DNA is genetic material.",

During interphase, the cell copies its DNA in preparation for mitosis. Interphase is the phase of the 'everyday life' or metabolism of a cell, during which the cell obtains nutrients and metabolizes them, grows, reads its DNA, and performs other \"normal\" cell functions. This phase was previously called the resting phase. However, interphase does not describe cells that are simply resting. Instead of the cell living and preparing for the next cell division, what happens is that the name changes (on purpose). The most common misconception is that interphase is the first stage of mitosis, but since mitosis is nuclear division, prophase is actually the first stage. In interphase, the cell gets ready for mitosis or meiosis. Somatic cells, or normal diploid cells of the body, go through mitosis to reproduce themselves by cell division, whereas diploid germ cells (i.e., primary spermatocytes and primary oocytes) go through meiosis to make haploid gametes between the sperm and the ovary for the purpose of reproduction. The stages of the cellular interphase are divided into 3 parts, with each phase ending when a cellular checkpoint checks the completion of the stage for accuracy before moving on to the next. The stages of interphase are: The duration of time spent in interphase and in each interphase stage varies and depends on the type of cell and the species of organism it belongs to. Most adult mammal cells spend a full day or about 24 hours on the sidelines. This G0 will account for about 93% (or more) of the total time involved in the cell division.

This direction leads to the Kaaba building in the Grand Mosque, Mecca, Saudi Arabia, which according to Muslims is a sacred building built by two Prophets, namely Ibrahim and his son Ismail. According to Muslim beliefs, this Qibla direction is ordered by Allah in the Qur'an, Surah Al-Baqarah verses 144, 149 and 150 which was revealed to the Islamic Prophet Muhammad in the 2nd year of Hijriyah; earlier Muhammad and his followers in Medina had turned towards Jerusalem. But after Muhammad heard that the Jews said, \"By God, Muhammad and his companions did not know where their Qibla was until we directed them to it\"; which caused displeasure with him, the Qibla was finally moved to the Kaaba, this happened in the 16th or 17th month after Muhammad and the Muslims arrived in Medina. In addition to prayer, the Qiblah is also the direction in which the pilgrimage takes place, the direction an animal faces when it is slaughtered, the direction a Muslim's corpse is buried, the direction recommended for prayer, and the direction to avoid defecating and expelling phlegm.

According to one history (mentioned by historian Ibn Jarir ath-Tabari and commentator Al-Baidhawi), Muhammad prayed facing the Kaaba, while another history (also mentioned by ath-Tabari and Ahmad al-Baladzuri) states that when in Makkah he oriented to Jerusalem. There is also a history (mentioned in the sirah by Ibn Hisham) which states that at that time, Muhammad always prayed in such a way that he was simultaneously facing the Kaaba and Jerusalem. Now Muslims, both Sunni and Shia, all face the Kaaba. The only major exception in history is the Qaramithah, a Shiite sect who in 930 had attacked the Kaaba and seized the Black Stone from the Kaaba to its seat of power in Al-Ahsa with the intention of starting a new era in Islam. Etymologically, the word Qibla comes from the Arabic word \u0642\u0628\u0644\u0629 (qiblah) which means \"direction\", but in the Islamic context this term refers to a specific direction related to worship. Scholars agree that under normal circumstances, prayer is only valid if it is performed facing the Qiblah. Exceptions to this condition include praying in a state of fear or war, or praying sunnah while traveling. In addition to the direction of prayer, the hadith also mentions the need to face the Qiblah when in ihram during the pilgrimage, and after throwing the jumratul wustha. According to adab rules, Qibla is also the direction the animal's face is when it is slaughtered, as well as the direction the body's face is when it is buried. The Hadith also encourages praying towards the Qibla and forbids defecating or expelling phlegm towards the Qibla. In mosque architecture, the Qibla direction is usually indicated by a niche or indentation in the mosque's wall facing forward.",

        "paragraph": "This niche is called the mihrab; this is where the priest stands in front of the congregation when leading the congregational prayers. The new mihrab began to become part of the mosque's architecture during the Umayyad period and its form was uniformed at the beginning of the Abbasid period. In the past, the Qibla direction could be found from the direction of one of the mosque's walls. The word mihrab does not appear in the Qur'an and hadith; the only mention of this word refers only to the place of worship of the Children of Israel. b] Amr bin al-Ash Mosque in Fustat, Egypt, one of the oldest mosques in Islamic history, was originally built without a mihrab, although now the niche has been added. 'Ainul Kaaba is a way of facing the Qibla correctly so that if a line is drawn in the direction of the person's front position, the line will hit the Kaaba building. This can be done easily in the Grand Mosque and its surroundings, but for locations far from Mecca this is very difficult to do considering the width of the Kaaba which is only dozens of meters. The farther a location is from the Ka'bah, the greater the chance of inaccuracy in the direction of 'ainul Ka'bah. From Jakarta, Indonesia, which is about 7,900 km from Mecca, a shift in direction of just 1 arc second (\u200b1\u20443600 degrees) will result in a deviation of >100 meters from the Kaaba building. A shift of 1\u00b0, which may not be felt by a person praying and is much smaller than the error range of measurement tools, results in a shift of >100 km. As a comparison, in the process of building a mosque, it is common for a shift of up to 5\u00b0 from the desired direction (depending on the technique used), and in the laying of carpets or prayer rugs, a shift of up to 5\u00b0 can occur. Some scholars such as Ibn Arabi consider that the 'ainul kaaba must be performed in prayer, while other scholars only require it if they are able.",

        "paragraph": "For locations far from Mecca, scholars such as Imam Hanafi and Al-Qurthubi allow the Jihatul Kaaba method, which is simply to point to the Qibla. According to some interpretations, a person can be said to be facing the Qiblah for worship purposes as long as the Kaaba building is still within the projection sector of that person's vision (the human field of vision usually reaches more than 90\u00b0 or a quarter of a full circle). For example, some scholars of Al-Andalus (Spain and Portugal during the Islamic period) considered a full quadrant (clockwise from east to south) as the valid Qibla direction. Among the reasons put forward by the scholars who support the Jihatul Ka'bah are the words of the Al-Qur'an text which only instructs \"turn your face towards the Grand Mosque\", and avoids the burden that would be impossible if the 'Ainul Kaaba were deemed obligatory in all places. . The Shafi'i school, as written in Kitab al-Tanbih fil-Fiqh by Abu Ishaq asy-Syirazi, requires following the Qibla that is already in the mosque if it is not near Mecca, and asking people who can be trusted if it is not near the mosque . If there are none, according to the Shafi'i school of thought one can perform ijtihad (find out for oneself) or use improvised tools. Theoretically, the most common model used in scientifically determining Qibla direction is to use the great circle direction that connects the local location to the Qibla location. The great circle (also called the orthodrom) is the circle on the surface of the ball whose center point is the same as the center point of the ball. Any circle formed by longitude is an example of a great circle, but latitude does not form a great circle (because its center is north or south of the earth's center) except the equator. One special property of the great circle is that the shortest path that can connect any two points on a sphere is shown by the great circle connecting the two points.",

Therefore, the Qibla direction from a place calculated according to the great circle model is usually similar to the direct flight direction from that city to Mecca. Since the shape of the earth is actually not a perfect sphere and is somewhat ellipsoidal in shape, modern researchers also use models according to the ellipsoidal shape to calculate the Qiblah, by replacing the great circle with an ellipsoidal geodesic. This requires far more complicated calculations, while the increase in accuracy is far smaller than the precision that might be achieved when rolling prayer mats or building mosques. For example, calculations using the GRS 80 ellipsoid model produce a Qibla direction of 18\u00b047\u203206\u2033 for a location in San Francisco, United States of America, while calculations using the large circle model yield a direction that is not much different, namely 18\u00b051\u203205\u2033. The great circle model mentioned above is applied in reckoning or calculating the Qibla direction using spherical trigonometry formulas. Spherical trigonometry is the branch of geometry that concerns the relationships between the angles and sides of triangles formed by the great circles on the surface of a sphere (instead of ordinary trigonometry which involves plane triangles). In the image of the globe below, the location of a place is called T{\\displaystyle T}, the location of the Qibla is Q{\\displaystyle Q}, and the north pole is U{\\displaystyle U}, and the three points form a triangle on the earth's surface . Qibla direction is the direction TQ{\\displaystyle TQ}, or the direction of the great circle that passes through T{\\displaystyle T} and Q{\\displaystyle Q}. This direction can also be expressed as an angle to the north (inhiraf al-qiblat) i.e. \u2220UTQ{\\displaystyle \\angle UTQ} or \u2220q{\\displaystyle \\angle q}. This direction can be calculated as a function of the local latitude position LT{\\displaystyle L_{T}}, the qibla latitude position LQ{\\displaystyle L_{Q}}, and the difference in longitude between local locations \u0394B{\\displaystyle \\Delta B}.",

The difference in longitude \u0394B{\\displaystyle \\Delta B} for the two places is 110.364444\u00b0 - 39.825183\u00b0 = 70.539261\u00b0.

This means that the Qibla direction from Yogyakarta is about 295\u00b0 (clockwise from north), or tilted about 25\u00b0 from the west point to the north. This formula was derived in modern times, but methods equivalent to this formula have been known to Muslim astronomers since the 3rd century Hijri (9th century AD). Early scientists who discovered these methods included Habasy al-Hasib (active in Damascus and Baghdad around 850 AD), An-Nairizi (Bagdad, around 900 AD), Ibn Yunus (10-11 centuries AD), Ibn al -Haitsam (11th century AD), and Al-Biruni (11th century AD). The use of spherical trigonometry forms the basis of almost all applications or sites for calculating the Qibla direction. After the size of this angle is calculated, it is necessary to know the true north direction to show that direction in the field. Among the methods used is observing the shadow when the sun crosses the local meridian (the imaginary line that connects the north pole and the south pole). At that time the image of an upright object will have an exact north-south orientation. The results of this observation are quite accurate but require an accurate calculation of the time the meridian crossing occurs at that place, and observations can only be made at that time.",

This declination (deviation) can reach up to 20\u00b0 and varies from place to place and from year to year. From every location on earth, the sun experiences apparent daily motion, that is, it appears to move from east to west every day. At certain times in the middle of the day, there is an upper culmination point or transit of the upper meridian, which is when the sun is at its zenith and the sun passes through the local longitude. However, the sun also has an annual apparent motion, which moves between 23.5\u00b0 north latitude and 23.5\u00b0 south latitude (solstice), so that at the time of culmination the sun is not always directly above, and is more often directly north. or south. For any place below 23.5\u00b0 north or south latitude, at a certain time of year the sun's latitude will be the same as the local latitude. Only at that time, when the culmination occurs, the sun is directly above that place. The city of Mecca is one of the places that experiences this, because its position is around 21\u00b025' north latitude. This event occurs twice a year, on May 28 at around 12.18 Saudi Arabian Time (WAS) or 16.18 WIB and July 16 at 12.27 WAS (16.27 WIB). At both times, the sun is approximately above the Kaaba so that all upright objects exposed to the sun's light will have a shadow that shows the direction of the Kaaba (see picture). In astronomy, this event is called istiwa a'zham (primary culmination), and this method of finding the Qibla direction is called rashd al-qiblat (\"observing the Qibla direction\").",

In that hemisphere, the shadow indicating the Qibla direction can be observed when the sun is directly below the Qibla (or directly above the antipode point of the Kaaba). The direction of the shadow that is formed is exactly opposite to the direction of the shadow at the time of rashd al-qiblat.

The spherical trigonometry method yields the closest straight line connecting the Kaaba to any location in the world, but this direction can sometimes seem odd when you imagine the earth on a flat map. For example, the Qibla direction of Alaska (near the north pole) is actually almost straight north. A straight line between two places on a world map projected by a Merkator (called a loksodrom or rhumb line) is often different from the Qibla direction shown by calculations (orthodrom or great circle). This difference is apparent in locations such as parts of North America (flat map shows Mecca in the southeast while Qibla calculation shows northeast) or Japan (flat map shows southwest while calculation shows northwest). Most Muslims follow the orthodrom direction (according to the results of calculations) and only a small number follow the loksodrome direction (straight line on the flat earth map). d] Historical records and evidence from old mosques show that the Qibla is also often determined by simple methods based on tradition or popular science not based on astronomy.",

Several old mosques in Al-Andalus (now Spain) and Central Asia point to the south even though these two places are far to the west and east of Mecca (so from that place the south does not lead to Mecca). In addition, there is a \"qibla of the companions\" (qiblat ash-shahabah), namely the Qibla direction used by the companions of the Prophet (the first generation of Muslims who are considered role models by Muslims) in that place. This direction was often followed through the centuries, although later Muslim astronomers used astronomical calculations and found a different Qibla direction. For example, the qibla of the companions in Syria and Palestine is facing south, in Egypt it is towards the farthest winter sunrise, and in Iraq it is towards sunset at the same time. The direction of sunset and sunrise in winter was also chosen because these two directions are parallel to the orientation of the walls of the Kaaba. Muslims use various tools to determine the Qibla direction if they are not near a mosque. Qibla compass is an ordinary compass equipped with a table or list of Qibla directions from major cities. In addition, there is an electronic compass that uses satellites to obtain local coordinates so that it can automatically show the Qibla direction. Qibla compasses have been made since at least around 1300, with the Qibla directions of various cities written or engraved on these compasses.

Muslims are required to know the Qibla direction for daily prayers, as well as to determine the direction of the mosque building. Therefore, determining the direction of Qibla is an important problem that Islamic communities have tried to solve in history. At the time Muhammad was living with the Muslims in Medina (which was still in the Hijaz area like Mecca), he was praying to the south, according to the direction of Mecca which was known from Medina. Within a few generations after Muhammad's death in 632, Muslims had reached places so far from Mecca that a method was needed to determine the Qibla direction. Mathematical methods based on astronomy only began to be discovered in the late 8th or early 9th century (and at first these methods were not very popular), so that at first Muslims used traditional methods. The traditional methods that developed at the beginning of the expansion of Islam were quite diverse and resulted in different qibla directions. Among the commonly used directions are the south direction (in the direction Muhammad prayed in Medina) or the direction used by the Prophet's companions in that place (the \"Qiblah of the Companions\", varies depending on the place). The Arabs also know traditional astrology (called folk astronomy or \"folk astronomy\" by David A. King to distinguish it from real astronomy which is an exact science) which originates from pre-Islamic traditions. These sciences use natural phenomena, such as observations of the sun, moon, stars and wind without any mathematical basis. Various places have their own Qibla directions based on the rising or setting position of certain stars (which rise or set in the same position throughout the year in the same place), as well as the position of the rising or setting sun during the equinoxes (showing the exact direction east and west) or turning points (showing certain angles with respect to east or west).",

These directions are written in many fiqh texts and folk astronomy texts, and in the same place there may be many directions with different sources. Astronomers (other than folk astronomy) usually do not comment on these methods, but these methods are not opposed by jurists. This method even continued to be used when astronomers began to find ways to calculate the direction to Mecca using mathematics, which was different from the previously known Qibla direction. Qibla direction with these methods can also be found in old mosques that are still standing today. The true science of astronomy (called astronomy) began to be studied in the Islamic world in the late 8th century, especially in Baghdad, the main city of the Abbasid Caliphate. Initially, Muslim scientists studied astronomy from the works of Indian authors, but in the 9th century the works of Greek astronomers such as Ptolemy began to be translated and became the main reference in this field. The science of astronomy developed by Ptolemy was considered more important by scientists in the Islamic world because it was supported by theoretical explanations so that it could be further developed as an exact science, but Indian astronomy still had a significant influence, especially in the field of compiling astronomical tables.

According to the historian of astronomy David A. King, the various solutions that Muslim scientists came up with \"witness the development of mathematical methods from the 3rd to 8th centuries AH (9th to 14th centuries AD) and the level of sophistication of trigonometry and calculation techniques that achieved by these scientists.\" Mathematical methods originally invented in the early 9th century were approximation methods (not accurate methods, but only yields directions that approximate the actual directions) which generally used flat maps or simple two-dimensional geometries. Because the earth is three-dimensional, the results of this calculation are not exactly the same as the actual direction, but for locations that are still close to Mecca (such as Egypt or Iran) this method can produce directions that are only 1\u00b0\u20132\u00b0 off the true direction. Accurate methods based on three-dimensional geometry or spherical trigonometry appeared from the mid-9th century. Habasy al-Hasib (lived c. 850 AD) records one of the earliest examples of this method, namely by using \"analema\" (now called orthographic projections), namely the use of a plane to derive complex formulas in spherical trigonometry. In this method, a number of points and lines are drawn on a circle with a certain technique, and the results can be proven in accordance with the Qibla direction which is calculated using modern formulas.",

Based on these methods of reckoning, Muslim scientists made tables showing the Qibla direction from various places in the world, arranged according to the difference in longitude (\u0394B) and latitude (\u0394L) from Mecca. The oldest known example is a table made in Baghdad around the 9th century for each degree and minute of arc from 1\u00b0 to 20\u00b0. In the 14th century Shamsuddin al-Khalili, a scientist who served as muwaqqit (time expert) at the Great Mosque of Damascus, made a table of Qibla directions for each coordinate point with a range of \u0394B from 1\u00b0 to 60\u00b0 and latitude from 10\u00b0 to 50\u00b0 North Latitude. . According to King, these tables are \"most impressive in terms of comprehensiveness and accuracy\", and most of the figures are correct by modern calculations. Although precise calculation methods have been discovered since the 9th century, the accuracy of the calculation results for a particular location also depends on the longitude and latitude coordinate data entered into the formulas. At that time, the latitude position of a location could be determined with an accuracy of up to several minutes, but the longitude position could not be determined precisely. One way to calculate \u0394B is to compare the time of the lunar eclipse in Mecca and the local location, or to calculate the distance traveled by a trade caravan.

For example, the al-Azhar Mosque in Cairo was built according to scientific reckoning using the correct formula, but because the \u0394B value used is 3\u00b0 off the correct value, the mosque's Qibla direction (127\u00b0) differs from the modern calculated direction (135\u00b0) . Accurate longitude coordinates in the Islamic world were only discovered in the 18th and 19th centuries with the application of cartographic geometry. These modern coordinates, along with modern technology such as GPS satellites and electronic devices, have made it possible to make tools that can calculate Qibla in a practical way. This direction may differ from the direction of existing mosques for various reasons, for example because the mosque was built before the appearance of modern data and calculations or because the mosque was not built accurately. Sometimes the direction of the mihrab of the mosque is still followed, or sometimes a marker is made such as a line or rope so that the congregation prays according to the marker instead of according to the direction of the mosque's mihrab. Because throughout history there have been various methods of determining the direction of the Qibla, the mosques that were built (including the mosques that are still standing today) have a different Qibla. The methods discovered by scientists are not always used in the construction of mosques. Mathematical calculations with the same principle can have different results due to differences in the accuracy of the data or calculations. For example, the Egyptian historian Al-Maqrizi (d. 1442 AD) recorded the various Qibla directions used by mosques in Cairo at that time: 90\u00b0 (straight east), 117\u00b0 (the farthest position the sun rises in winter, according to the \"qibla of the companions\"), 127\u00b0 (calculations of scientists, for example Ibn Yunus), 141\u00b0 (Ibn Thulun's mosque), 156\u00b0 (the rising position of the star Suhail/Canopus), 180\u00b0 (straight south, according to the direction of Muhammad's prayer from Medina), and 204\u00b0 (Canopus setting position).",

The historical accounts of Muslim writers mention this diversity in other Muslim cities such as Cordoba and Samarkand. According to the concept of the Jihatul Ka'bah, the various directions that are still close together are not considered a problem because what is required in worship is to point approximately towards the Kaaba without having to be precise. In the archipelago, variations in the direction of the Qiblah also occur because of traditional knowledge which considers Mecca to be in the west direction so that mosques are built straight to the west or according to the direction of the sunset (which is not exactly west but shifts continuously throughout the year), or sometimes it is adjusted to the direction of the road and the different land. available. The qibla from astronomical calculations ranges from 291\u00b0\u2014295\u00b0 (21\u00b0\u201325\u00b0 oblique towards north from west), depending on the exact location. Indonesian astronomers have differed on this: Tono Saksono et al. argues that the requirement to face the Qiblah is a \"spiritual requirement\" rather than a physical requirement and that determining the exact direction to the Kaaba building from a distance of thousands of kilometers requires too high a precision that is impossible to fulfill in the construction of mosques or when standing in prayer. Meanwhile, Muhammad Hadi Bashori is of the opinion that \"aligning the Qibla direction is actually a very urgent matter\", and can be guided by simple methods that are quite precise, such as the method of observing shadows. In history, a serious Qibla direction dispute occurred in Yogyakarta in the 1890s.

In places that have long been occupied by the Muslim community, the issue of Qibla direction is usually no longer debated. Some places, such as the United States and Canada, have only had large Islamic communities in the last few decades so Qibla direction is sometimes an issue.

Most mosques founded by early Muslim immigrant communities in the United States face east or southeast, as shown on a flat map. In 1978, as the number of Muslims and mosques in North America grew, S. Kamal Abdali, an American Muslim scientist, wrote the results of his study which stated that the proper Qibla for North America is north or northeast, according to the closest line connecting Mecca with places on the continent (\"great circle\" line). This conclusion was widely accepted by the Muslim community and mosques changed their Qibla direction. In 1990, two Islamic scholars named Riad Nachef and Samir Kadi wrote a book arguing that the correct direction is southeast, as shown on a flat earth map.

Some salamanders that live on land have lungs used for respiration, although these are simple and sac-like structures unlike other complex organs found in mammals. Many species also have both (lungs and skin) as adults. Some land species have neither and exchange gases through their skin. Even some lung species also breathe through the skin. The salamander's skin secretes mucus. This is to help them stay moist when in dry areas and maintain their salt balance while in the water as well as acting as a lubricant during swimming. Salamanders also secrete poison from glands in their bodies and some have additional skin glands to secrete fluids during reproduction.",

Its tail will wag slightly to distract predators, while the rest of it escapes. There are more than 350 lungless salamanders. Most are land-dwelling and active during the day. Lungless salamanders can communicate with their noses. Smallish salamanders are found on the Pacific coast. They are sometimes called \"salamander worms\".

Various traditions in philosophy, religion, psychology, and cognitive science have attempted to understand the mind and its properties. The main problems related to the mind are related to the brain and nervous system, which are commonly called mind-body problems. Various approaches have been proposed, such as dualism which holds that the mind is separate from the body and physicalism which emphasizes that the mind originates from and is reducible to physical phenomena such as neurological processes. Another problem is related to the existence of a mind like that of animals or artificial intelligence. Some important philosophers of mind are Plato, Descartes, Leibniz, Kant, Martin Heidegger, John Searle, and Daniel Dennett. Psychologists such as Sigmund Freud and William James have also developed influential theories of the human mind. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, cognitive science developed and led to the emergence of various new approaches. Mind or mentality is usually contrasted with body, matter, or physicality. This problem of the nature of contrast and in particular the relationship between mind and brain is called the mind-body problem. Traditional viewpoints include dualism and idealism, which regard the mind as non-physical. Modern views often center on physicalism and functionalism, which argue that the mind is roughly identical to the brain or can be reduced to physical phenomena such as neural activity. Psychologists such as Freud and James, and computer scientists such as Turing developed influential theories about the nature of the mind. The possibilities of the nonbiological mind are explored in the field of artificial intelligence, which works closely in conjunction with cybernetics and information theory to understand how the processing of information by nonbiological machines is comparable or different to mental phenomena in the human mind.",

The majority of the human mind and mind are 'sub-critical' in nature. This is because an idea presented to such a mind will, on average, elicit less than one idea in response, but a small proportion are highly critical. The real mind must be peeled deep to get the core idea of \u200b\u200bone's mind. Budi or mind comes from the Old English word gemynd meaning the ability to remember, not to think in general. Old English had other words for \"mind,\" such as hyge \"mind, spirit.\" The generalization of the meaning of mind or mind, that is to include all mental faculties, thought, will, feeling, and memory, gradually developed during the 14th and 15th centuries. Mind or mind is often understood as an ability that manifests itself in mental phenomena such as sensation, perception, thinking, reasoning, memory, belief, will, emotion and motivation. Mind or mentality is usually contrasted with the body, material or physical. Central to this contrast is the intuition that the mind exhibits various features which are not found and perhaps even do not correspond to the material universe as described by natural science. In the traditionally dominant substantialist view associated with Ren\u00e9 Descartes, mind is defined as an independent thinking substance. However, it is more common in contemporary philosophy to understand mind not as a substance, but as a trait or capacity possessed by humans and the higher animals. Despite this agreement, there are still many differences of opinion regarding the true nature of mind and various competing definitions have been proposed. Philosophical definitions of the mind are usually proceeding not only from the various kinds of phenomena of the mind, but by looking for a \"mental sign\": that part which is shared by all mental states and only by mental states.",

This is often combined with a mindfulness-based approach, which emphasizes the primacy of mindfulness over mind. The intentionality-based approach, on the other hand, looks at the power of the mind to refer to objects and represent the world in a certain way as mental signs. According to behaviorism, whether an entity has a mind depends only on how it behaves in response to external stimuli while functionalism defines mental states in terms of the causal role they play. The differences between these various approaches are important because they lead to very different answers to questions such as whether animals or computers have minds. The epistemic approach emphasizes that subjects have privileged access to all or at least some of their mental states. It is sometimes claimed that access to this mentality is direct, personal, and perfect. Direct access refers to non-inferential knowledge. When someone is in pain, for example, they know right away that they are in pain, they don't need to infer it from other indicators such as a swollen body part or their tendency to scream when touched. But we arguably also have non-inferential knowledge of external objects, such as trees or cats, through perception, which is why this criterion alone is insufficient. Another oft-mentioned epistemic privilege is that mental states are private as opposed to public external facts. For example, a fallen tree lying at a person's feet is directly open to perception by bystanders while the victim's pain is private: only they know it firsthand while bystanders have to infer it from their screams. It has traditionally been claimed that we have perfect knowledge of our own mental states, namely that we cannot be wrong about them when we have them.",

However, various counter-examples have been presented for claims of infallibility, which is why this criterion is not usually accepted in contemporary philosophy. One way to respond to this worry is to assume the privileged status of the conscious mental state. In such a mindfulness-based approach, conscious mental states are non-derivative constituents of the mind, while unconscious states depend on their conscious nature for their existence. An influential example of this position is due to John Searle, who argued that unconscious mental states must be accessible to consciousness to count as \"mental\" at all. The intentionality-based approach sees intentionality as a mental sign. The originator of this approach is Franz Brentano, who defines intentionality as a characteristic mental state to refer to or be about objects. One advantage of this approach over the epistemic approach is that it has no problem explaining unconscious mental states: they can be as intentional as they are in conscious mental states and thus qualify as constituents of mind. But the problem for this approach is that there are also some non-mental entities that have intentionality, such as maps or linguistic expressions. The definition of behaviorism characterizes a mental state as a disposition to engage in certain observable public behaviors as a reaction to certain external stimuli. In this view, to give confidence to someone is to describe the tendency of that person to behave in a certain way.

Words that refer to similar concepts and processes include deliberation, cognition, idea, discourse and imagination. The mental phenomena engendered by the faculties of the mind have been categorized according to various differences. An important distinction is grouping mental phenomena together according to whether they are sensory, qualitative, propositional, intentional, conscious or rational. These distinct differences result in overlapping categorizations. Some mental phenomena, such as perception or body awareness, are sensory, that is, based on the senses. Mental content or contents are items that are considered to be \"inside\" the mind, and capable of being formed and manipulated by mental processes and abilities. Examples include thoughts, concepts, memories, emotions, perceptions, and intentions.

The atomic nucleus consists of positively charged protons and neutrally charged neutrons (except in the atomic nucleus of Hydrogen-1, which has no neutrons). The electrons in an atom are bound to the nucleus by electromagnetic forces. A collection of such atoms can also bond with each other, and form a molecule. Atoms containing the same number of protons and electrons are neutral, while those containing a different number of protons and electrons are positive or negative and are called ions. Atoms are grouped based on the number of protons and neutrons contained in the atomic nucleus. The number of protons in an atom determines the chemical element of that atom, and the number of neutrons determines the isotope of that element. The term atom comes from the Greek (\u1f04\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2/\u00e1tomos, \u03b1-\u03c4\u03b5\u03bc\u03bd\u03c9), which means indivisible or indivisible. The concept of the atom as an indivisible component was first proposed by Indian and Greek philosophers. In the 17th and 18th centuries, chemists laid the foundations for this idea by showing that certain substances could not be broken down any further by chemical methods. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, physicists discovered subatomic structures and components within atoms, proving that the 'atom' was not indivisible. The principles of quantum mechanics used by physicists then succeeded in modeling the atom. In everyday observation, relatively atom is considered a very small object that has a proportionally small mass.

Electrons bound to atoms contain a number of stable energy levels, or orbitals, and can undergo transitions between them by absorbing or emitting photons that match the energy differences between the levels. The electrons in an atom determine the chemical properties of an element, and influence the magnetic properties of that atom. The concept that matter is composed of discrete units that cannot be subdivided into smaller units has been around for a millennium. However, these thoughts are still abstract and philosophical in nature, rather than based on empirical observations and experiments. Philosophically, descriptions of the properties of atoms vary depending on the culture and school of philosophy, and often contain spiritual elements in them. Nevertheless, the basic ideas about atoms could be accepted by scientists thousands of years later, because they could elegantly explain new discoveries in chemistry. The earliest reference to the concept of the atom can be traced back to ancient India in 800 BC, which are described in Jain philosophical texts as anu and paramanu. The Nyaya and Vaisesika schools of thought developed theories that explained how atoms combined to form more complex things. A century later, references to atoms in the West appeared by Leucippos, who later systematized this view by his student Demokritos. Around 450 BC, Democritus coined the term \u00e1tomos (Greek: \u1f04\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2), meaning \"uncut\" or \"undividable\".

Further advances in the understanding of atoms began with the development of chemistry. In 1661, Robert Boyle published The Skeptical Chymist, which argued that the world's matter was composed of various combinations of \"corpuscules,\" that is, different atoms. This differs from the classical view which holds that matter consists of the elements air, earth, fire, and water. In 1789, the term element was defined by the French aristocrat and researcher Antoine Lavoisier as a basic substance that could not be further divided using chemical methods. Aristotle said that there are 4 basic elements in the earth and when they are all combined they will form the compounds we see. At that time his student asked: \"Can we make gold if we combine all the basic elements?\" Aristotle answered \"Yes\". It made scientists wonder where it was 200 years later. In 1669, the German chemist Hennig Brand distilled 60 buckets of urine because he thought there was real gold in it (because urine is golden yellow) and his chemical apparatus glowed in the dark. He named him Phosphorus (Phosphorus) after the Greek word \"Phosphoros\" which means evening star. He was the first person in the era of AD, which was previously the discovery of arsenic 300 BC.

This particle theory was further confirmed in 1827, when the botanist Robert Brown used a microscope to observe dust floating on water and found that the dust moved randomly. This phenomenon became known as \"Brownian Motion\". In 1877, J. Desaulx proposed that this phenomenon was caused by the thermal motion of water molecules, and in 1905 Albert Einstein made a mathematical analysis of this motion. The French physicist Jean Perrin then used Einstein's work to determine the mass and dimensions of the atom experimentally, which later proved definitively to Dalton's atomic theory. Based on the results of his research on cathode rays, in 1897 J. J. Thomson discovered the electron and its subatomic properties. This undermines the concept of the atom as an indivisible unit. Thomson believed that the electrons were evenly distributed throughout the atom, and the charges were balanced by the presence of a sea of \u200b\u200bpositive charges (the plum pudding model). But in 1909, researchers under the direction of Ernest Rutherford shot helium ions into gold foil, and found that a small proportion of the ions reflected at a sharper angle of reflection than what Thomson's theory had predicted. Rutherford later proposed that an atom's positive charge and most of its mass is concentrated in the atomic nucleus, with the electrons orbiting the nucleus like planets around the sun. Positively charged helium ions passing through this dense nucleus should be reflected at a sharper angle of reflection. In 1913, while experimenting with the results of radioactive decay processes, Frederick Soddy discovered that there was more than one type of atom at each position in the periodic table.",

An electron must absorb or emit a certain amount of energy to be able to transition between these fixed orbits. When light from the heated matter shines through a prism, it produces a multi-colored spectrum. The appearance of certain spectral lines is successfully explained by this orbital transition theory. Chemical bonds between atoms were later described in 1916 by Gilbert Newton Lewis as interactions between the electrons of the atoms. For the regularity of chemical properties in the chemical period table, the American chemist Irving Langmuir in 1919 argued that this could be explained if the electrons in an atom are interconnected or assembled in certain forms. A group of electrons is thought to occupy a set of electron shells around the atomic nucleus. The Stern-Gerlach experiment in 1922 provided further evidence of the quantum properties of atoms. When a beam of silver atoms is shot through a magnetic field, the beam is separated according to the direction of the atom's angular momentum (spin). Since the direction of the spins is random, this beam is expected to spread out in a single line.

A consequence of using waveforms to describe these electrons is that it is mathematically impossible to calculate the position and momentum of a particle simultaneously. This became known as the uncertainty principle, which was formulated by Werner Heisenberg in 1926. According to this concept, for each measurement of a position, one can only obtain a range of momentum probability values, and vice versa. Although this model is difficult to visualize, it can well explain observed atomic properties that previously could not be explained by any other theory. Therefore, the atomic model which depicts electrons revolving around the atomic nucleus like planets revolving around the sun was aborted and replaced by an atomic orbital model around the nucleus where the electrons are most likely to be. Developments in mass spectrometry allowed precise measurements of atomic masses to be made. This spectrometer apparatus uses a magnet to deflect the trajectory of the ion beam, and the amount of deflection is determined by the ratio of the atomic mass to the charge. Chemist Francis William Aston used this apparatus to show that isotopes have different masses. The mass difference between these isotopes is an integer, and it is called the integer rule. Explanation of the difference in the mass of these isotopes was solved after the discovery of the neutron, a neutrally charged particle with nearly the same mass as the proton, by James Chadwick in 1932. Isotopes were then explained as elements with the same number of protons, but different numbers of neutrons in their composition. atomic nucleus.

This difference in the composition of the quarks affects the difference in mass and charge between the two particles. Quarks are held together by the strong nuclear force mediated by gluons. Gluons are members of the gauge bosons which are intermediaries for physical forces. The atomic nucleus consists of protons and neutrons bound together at the center of the atom. Collectively, these protons and neutrons are referred to as nucleons (particles that make up the nucleus). The diameter of the atomic nucleus ranges from 10\u221215 to 10\u221214 m. The estimated core radius is 1.07A3{\\displaystyle {\\begin{smallmatrix}1.07{\\sqrt{3}]{A}}\\end{smallmatrix}}}\u00a0fm, where A is the number of nucleons. This is very small compared to the atomic radius. The nucleons are bound together by a potential attractive force called the residual strong force. At distances smaller than 2.5 fm, these forces are stronger than the electrostatic forces that cause the protons to repel each other. Atoms of the same chemical element have the same number of protons, called the atomic number. An atomic nucleus that has a specific atomic number, mass number, and half-life is called a nuclide. An element can have a varying number of neutrons. These variations are referred to as isotopes. Isobars are elements that have the same mass number but different atomic numbers.",

        "paragraph": "Isotopes of elements that have the same number of electrons but different mass numbers and atomic numbers. The number of protons and neutrons of an atom will determine the atomic nuclide, while the number of neutrons relative to the number of protons will determine the stability of the atomic nucleus, with certain isotopes of elements undergoing radioactive decay. Neutrons and protons are two different types of fermions. The Pauli exclusion principle prohibits the existence of identical fermions (such as multiple protons) occupying the same quantum physical state at the same time. Therefore, each proton in the atomic nucleus must occupy a different quantum state with its own energy level. Pauli's principle also applies to neutrons. This prohibition does not apply to protons and neutrons that occupy the same quantum state. For atoms with a low atomic number, the atomic nucleus that has more protons than neutrons has the potential to fall into a lower energy state through radioactive decay which causes the number of protons and neutrons to balance. Therefore, atoms with a balanced number of protons and neutrons are more stable and tend not to decay. However, as the atomic number increases, the repulsive forces between protons mean that the atomic nucleus requires an even higher proportion of neutrons to maintain its stability. In the heaviest nuclei, the ratio of neutrons per proton needed to maintain stability increases to 1.5. The number of protons and neutrons in the atomic nucleus can be changed, although this requires very high energy because of the strong attractive force. Nuclear fusion occurs when many atomic particles combine to form a heavier nucleus. For example, in the core of the Sun, protons need an energy of about 3\u201310 keV to overcome the mutual repulsion and coalesce into a single nucleus.",

        "paragraph": "Nuclear fission is the reverse of the fusion process. In nuclear fission, the nucleus is split into two smaller nuclei. This usually occurs through radioactive decay. Atomic nuclei can also be altered through bombardment of high-energy subatomic particles. If this changes the number of protons in the nucleus, the atom will change its element. If the mass of the nucleus after the fusion reaction occurs is less than the sum of the masses of the initial particles that make it up, then this difference is due to the release of energy emission (for example, gamma rays), as found in the Einstein mass-energy equivalence formula, E = mc2, where m is the mass that disappears and c is the speed of light. This deficit is part of the new nuclear binding energy. The fusion of two nuclei that results in a larger nucleus with an atomic number lower than that of iron and nickel (the total number of nucleons equals 60) is usually exothermic, meaning that the process releases energy. It is this process of releasing energy that allows nuclear fusion in stars to be sustained. For heavier nuclei, the binding energy per nucleon in the nucleus begins to decrease. This means that the fusion process will be endothermic. The electrons in an atom are attracted by the protons in the atomic nucleus through the electromagnetic force. This force holds the electrons in the electrostatic potential wells around the nucleus. This means that external energy is required for electrons to escape from atoms. The closer an electron is to the nucleus, the greater the attractive force, so electrons that are closer to the center of the potential well require more energy to escape. Electrons, like other particles, have both particle-like and wave-like properties (wave-particle dualism). An electron cloud is an area in a potential well where each electron generates a type of three-dimensional stationary wave (that is, a wave that does not move relative to the nucleus).",

There will only be a certain set of orbitals around the core, as other wave patterns will quickly decay into more stable forms. Each atomic orbital corresponds to a certain electron energy level. Electrons can change their state to a higher energy level by absorbing a photon. As well as being able to rise to a higher energy level, an electron can also descend to a lower energy state by emitting excess energy as a photon. The energy required to remove or add an electron (electron binding energy) is less than the binding energy of nucleons. For example, it only takes 13.6 eV to remove an electron from a hydrogen atom. Compare that to the 2.3 MeV required to split a deuterium nucleus. Atoms are electrically neutral because they have the same number of protons and electrons. Atoms that have a deficiency or excess of electrons are known as ions. Electrons that are located outside of the nucleus can be transferred or shared with other nearby atoms. In this way, atoms can bond together to form molecules. By definition, two atoms with the identical number of protons in their nuclei belong to the same chemical element. Atoms with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons are two different isotopes of the same element. For example, all hydrogen has one proton, but there is one isotope of hydrogen that has no neutrons (hydrogen-1), one isotope that has one neutron (deuterium), two neutrons (tritium), etc. Hydrogen-1 is the most common isotope of hydrogen.",

Twenty-seven elements have only one stable isotope, while the most common number of stable isotopes observed is tin with 10 types of stable isotopes. Since the majority of an atom's mass comes from protons and neutrons, the total number of these particles in an atom is referred to as the mass number. Atomic mass at rest is often expressed using the atomic mass unit (u) which is also called the dalton (Da). It is defined as one twelfth the mass of a neutral carbon-12 atom, which is approximately 1.66 \u00d7 10\u221227 kg. Hydrogen-1 which is the lightest isotope of hydrogen has an atomic weight of 1.007825 u. Atoms have a mass that is approximately equal to their mass number times the atomic mass units. The heaviest stable atom is lead-208, with a mass of 207.9766521 u. Chemists usually use the unit mole to express the number of atoms. One mole is defined as the number of atoms present in exactly 12 grams of carbon-12. This number is around 6.022 \u00d7 1023, which is also known as the Avogadro constant. Thus an element with an atomic mass of 1 u will have one mole of atoms with a mass of 0.001 kg. For example, Carbon has an atomic mass of 12 u, so one mole of carbon atoms has a mass of 0.012 kg.

Therefore, the smallest atom is helium with a radius of 32 pm, while the largest is cesium with a radius of 225 pm. This dimension is thousands of times smaller than a light wave (400\u2013700 nm), so atoms cannot be seen using an ordinary optical microscope. However, atoms can be monitored using an atomic force microscope. The size of the atom is very small, so small that the width of one strand of hair can accommodate about 1 million carbon atoms. One drop of water also contains about 2 \u00d7 1021 oxygen atoms.

Each element has one or more isotopes with an unstable nucleus which undergoes radioactive decay, causing the nucleus to release particles or electromagnetic radiation. Radioactivity can occur when the core radius is very large compared to the radius of the strong force (only acting at a distance of about 1 fm). The most common forms of radioactive decay are: Other rarer types of radioactive decay include the ejection of neutrons and protons from the nucleus, the emission of more than one beta particle, or decay resulting in the production of high-speed electrons instead of beta rays, and the production of photons high-energy non-gamma rays Each radioactive isotope has a characteristic decay time period (half-life) which is the length of time it takes for half the amount of sample to decay completely.",

        "paragraph": "The decay process is exponential, so that after two half-lives only 25% of the isotope remains. Every elementary particle has an intrinsic quantum mechanical property known as spin. Spin is analogous to the angular momentum of an object rotating about its center of mass, although rigidly the particle does not behave this way. Spin is measured in reduced Planck constants (\u0127), with electrons, protons, and neutrons all having a spin of \u00bd\u00a0\u0127, or \"spin-\u00bd\". In an atom, electrons moving around the atomic nucleus besides having spin also have orbital angular momentum, while the atomic nucleus also has angular momentum due to its own nuclear spin. The magnetic field produced by an atom (called the magnetic moment) is determined by the combination of these various angular moments. However, the biggest contribution still comes from spin. Because electrons obey the Pauli exclusion principle, in which no two electrons can be found in the same quantum state, pairs of electrons bonded to each other have opposite spins, with one spinning up and the other spinning down. The two opposing spins will neutralize each other, so that the total magnetic dipole moment becomes zero in some atoms with an even number of electrons. In an odd-electron atom such as iron, the presence of an unpaired electron causes the atom to be ferromagnetic. The atomic orbitals around the atom overlap and a lowering of the energy state is achieved when the spins of the unpaired electrons line up next to each other. This process is referred to as exchange interaction. When the magnetic moments of the ferromagnetic atoms line up, the material composed of these atoms can produce a detectable macroscopic field. Materials that are paramagnetic have atoms with magnetic moments that are arranged randomly, so that no magnetic field is produced.",

Usually the nuclear spins are arranged randomly due to thermal equilibrium. However, for certain elements (such as xenon-129), it is possible to polarize the nuclear spin states significantly so that the spins line up in the same direction. This condition is known as hyperpolarization. This phenomenon has important applications in magnetic resonance imaging. When an electron is bonded to an atom, it has a potential energy that is inversely proportional to the distance of the electron from the nucleus. It is measured by the energy required to remove an electron from an atom and is usually expressed in electronvolts (eV). In the quantum mechanical model, bound electrons can only occupy a set of states centered on the nucleus, and each state corresponds to a certain energy level. The lowest energy state of a bound electron is known as the ground state, while the higher energy state is known as the excited state. In order for an electron to jump from one state to another, it must absorb or emit a photon at an energy that matches the potential energy difference between the two levels. The energy of the emitted photon is proportional to its frequency. Each element has its own characteristic spectrum. This depends on the nuclear charge, the subshells filled with electrons, the electromagnetic interactions between electrons, and other factors. When a continuous spectrum of energy is passed through a gas or plasma, some of the photons are absorbed by the atoms, causing the electrons to change energy levels. The excited electrons will spontaneously emit this energy as photons and fall back down to a lower energy level.",

Spectroscopic measurements of strength and spectral bandwidth allow the determination of the composition and physical properties of a substance. Careful monitoring of the spectral lines shows that some exhibit fine separations. This happens because of the spin-orbit coupling which is the interaction between the spin and the motion of the outer electrons. When an atom is placed in an external magnetic field, the spectral lines split into three or more components. This is known as the Zeeman effect. The Zeeman effect is caused by the interaction of a magnetic field with the magnetic moments of atoms and their electrons. Some atoms can have multiple electron configurations with the same energy level, so they appear as one spectral line. The interaction of the magnetic field with the atom shifts the electron configurations to slightly different energy levels, causing multiple spectral lines. The presence of an external electric field can cause splitting and shifting of the spectral lines by changing the energy levels of the electrons. This phenomenon is known as the Stark effect. The outermost electron shell or shell of an atom in an uncombined state is called the valence shell and the electrons in the shell are called valence electrons. The number of valence electrons determines the bonding behavior of that atom with other atoms. Atoms tend to react with each other by filling (or emptying) the atom's outer valence electrons. Chemical bonding can be seen as the transfer of electrons from one atom to another, as seen in sodium chloride and other ionic salts. However, many elements exhibit multiple valence behavior, or a tendency to share different numbers of electrons in different compounds. Thus, the chemical bonds between these elements tend to be electron sharing rather than electron transfers.",

The elements on the far right of the table have their outermost shells completely filled, causing them to tend to be inert (noble gases). A number of atoms are found in different states of matter depending on the physical state of the object, i.e. temperature and pressure. By changing these conditions, matter can alternate between solid, liquid, gas, and plasma forms. In each of these conditions matter can also have various phases. For example in solid carbon, it can be either graphite or diamond. At temperatures close to absolute zero, atoms can form Bose-Einstein condensates, in which quantum mechanical effects that are normally only observable at the atomic scale are observed macroscopically. This supercooled collection of atoms behaves like a super atom. A scanning tunneling microscope is a microscope that is used to view the surface of an object at the atomic level. The device uses the phenomenon of quantum tunneling to allow particles to pass through normally impassable barriers. An atom can be ionized by removing an electron. The existing charge causes the trajectory of the atom to bend when it passes through a magnetic field. The radius of the ion trajectory is determined by the atomic mass. The mass spectrometer uses this principle to calculate the mass-to-charge ratio of ions. If the sample contains a number of isotopes, the mass spectrometer can determine the proportion of each isotope by measuring the intensity of the different ion beams.

Spectra of excited states can be used to analyze the atomic composition of distant stars. Certain wavelengths of light emitted by stars can be separated and matched by quantized transitions of free gas atoms. The star's color can then be replicated using a gas discharge lamp containing the same elements. Helium in the Sun was discovered using this method 23 years before it was found on Earth. Atoms make up about 4% of the total energy density in the observable universe, with an average density of about 0.25 atoms/m3. Within the Milky Way galaxy, atoms have a much higher concentration, with the density of matter in the interstellar medium ranging from 105 to 109 atoms/m3. The sun itself is believed to be in the Local Bubble, which is an area that contains a lot of ionic gas, so that the density around it is around 103 atoms/m3. Stars form dense clouds in the interstellar medium, and stellar evolutionary processes will lead to an increase in the content of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium in the interstellar medium. Up to 95% of the Milky Way's atoms are concentrated in stars, and the total mass of these atoms makes up about 10% of the galaxy's mass.

Isotopes such as lithium-6 are produced in space by cosmic ray spallation. This occurs when a high-energy proton slams into the nucleus of an atom, causing a large number of nucleons to be scattered. Elements heavier than iron are produced in supernovae by the r process and in AGB stars by the s process. Both involve capture of a neutron by the atomic nucleus. Elements such as lead are mostly formed by the radioactive decay of heavier elements. Most of the atoms that make up the Earth, including all living things, existed in their present form in the nebula that collapsed from the molecular cloud and formed the Solar System. The remainder is a result of radioactive decay and the proportions can be used to determine the age of the Earth via radiometric dating. Most of the helium in the Earth's crust is a product of alpha decay. There are very few atoms on Earth that did not exist at the beginning of their formation nor are they the result of radioactive decay. Carbon-14 is continuously produced by cosmic rays in the atmosphere. Some atoms on Earth are artificially produced by reactors or nuclear weapons. Of all the transuranium elements with an atomic number greater than 92, only plutonium and neptunium occur naturally on Earth.

This imbalance is still not fully understood, although there are theories of baryogenesis that provide a possible explanation. Antimatter has never been found naturally.

Learning is the result of the interaction between stimulus and response. Someone is considered to have learned something if he can show changes in his behavior. According to this theory, in learning what is important is the input in the form of a stimulus and the output in the form of a response. Stimulus is whatever the teacher gives to students (students), while the response is in the form of a student's reaction or response to the stimulus given by the teacher. The process that occurs between stimulus and response is not important to note because it cannot be observed and cannot be measured, what can be observed are stimulus and response. Therefore, what is given by the teacher (stimulus) and what is received by the learner (response) must be observable and measurable. There are four stages of human learning, namely: Conditions when we don't know, when in fact we don't know. An example is the state of mind of many young drivers when they start learning to drive. That is why young drivers have more accidents than older, experienced drivers. They cannot (or do not want to) acknowledge their limited knowledge, skills and experience. People in this state are more likely to take risks, exposing themselves to harm or loss, for the simple reason they are completely unaware that they are doing it. A self-conscious admission that we don't know, and full acceptance of the stupidity we all have done.

The stage of an expert just doing it, and maybe not even knowing how he did it in detail. He knew what he was doing, in other words, there was something he was doing in life that seemed risky to others but risk-free to him.

The previous definition stated that a human being can see in the changes that occur, but not the learning itself.

Learning is assistance provided by educators so that the process of acquiring knowledge and knowledge can occur, mastering skills and character, as well as forming attitudes and beliefs in students. In other words, learning is a process to help students learn well.

On the other hand learning has a similar meaning to teaching, but actually has a different connotation. In the context of education, teachers teach so that students can learn and master the content of the lesson until they achieve a specified objective (cognitive aspect), can also influence changes in attitudes (affective aspects), as well as skills (psychomotor aspects) of a learner, but this teaching process gives the impression that it is only the work of one party, namely the work of the teacher only. While learning implies an interaction between the teacher and students. Quality learning is highly dependent on student motivation and teacher creativity. Learners who have high motivation supported by teachers who are able to facilitate this motivation will lead to the success of achieving learning targets. Learning targets can be measured through changes in students' attitudes and abilities through the learning process. Good learning design, supported by adequate facilities, coupled with teacher creativity will make it easier for students to achieve learning targets. Three theories have been offered to explain the process by which a person acquires behavior patterns, namely classical conditioning, operant conditioning, and social learning. Classical conditioning is a type of conditioning in which the individual responds to some unusual stimulus and generates a new response. This theory grew out of an experiment to teach dogs to salivate in response to a ringing bell, conducted in the early 1900s by a Russian physiologist named Ivan Pavlov.

Thus, affirmation will strengthen a behavior and increase the likelihood of the behavior being repeated. What Pavlov did for classical conditioning, Harvard psychologist B. F. Skinner did for operant conditioning. Skinner suggested that creating pleasurable consequences for following a particular form of behavior would increase the frequency of that behavior. Social learning is the view that people can learn through direct observation and experience. Although social learning theory is an extension of operant conditioning, it assumes that behavior is a function of consequences. This theory also recognizes the existence of learning through observation and the importance of perception in learning. In the book Conditioning of Learning, (Gagne, 1977) put forward seven learning principles that can be carried out by teachers in carrying out learning. The seven learning principles are as follows: Attention has an important role in learning activities. From the study of information processing learning theory, it was revealed that without attention it is impossible to learn. Attention to the lesson will arise in students if the subject matter is in accordance with their needs. If the learning material is felt as something that is needed, needed for further study or needed in everyday life, it will generate attention and motivation to learn it. If in the student there is no attention to the lesson being studied, then the student needs to raise his attention. In the learning process, attention is a factor that has a big influence, if students have great attention on what is learned students can receive and choose relevant stimuli for further processing among the many stimuli that come from outside.",

        "paragraph": "Attention can make students to direct themselves to the task to be given; see the problems that will be given; choose and provide focus on the problem to be solved. In addition to attention, motivation has an important role in learning activities. Motivation is the energy that moves and directs one's activities. Motivation has a close relationship with interest. Students who have an interest in a particular field of study tend to be attracted to it and thus the motivation to study it arises. For example, students who like mathematics will enjoy learning mathematics and are encouraged to study harder, therefore it is the duty of the teacher to be able to instill a positive attitude in students towards the subjects they are responsible for. Motivation can be interpreted as a driving force that causes behavior. behavior towards a certain goal. The presence or absence of motivation in students can be observed from the observation of their behavior. If students have motivation, motivation can be internal, namely motivation that comes from within students and also externally from teachers, parents, friends and so on. With regard to this motivational principle there are several things that need to be considered in developing learning activities, namely: providing encouragement, providing incentives and also achievement motivation. According to the view of psychology, children are active beings. Children have the urge to do something, have their own will and aspirations. Learning cannot be forced by others nor can it be delegated to others. Learning is only possible when the child experiences it himself. John Dewey argued that learning is about what students have to do for themselves, so the initiative must come from himself, the teacher is only a guide and director.

Thordike suggests student activity in learning with his \"law of exercise\" which states that learning requires practice. The relationship between stimulus and response will increase if it is often used and will decrease or even disappear if it is never used. This means that in learning activities it is necessary to have exercises and habituation so that what is learned can be remembered longer. The more you practice, the more you will understand. This is also stated by Mc.Keachie that individuals are \"active learning people who always want to know\". In the learning process, students must show activity. This activity can be in the form of physical activities that are easy to observe or psychological activities that are difficult to observe. Physical activity can be in the form of reading, listening, writing, practicing skills and so on. Psychic activities, for example, use the knowledge possessed in solving problems encountered, comparing a concept with another, concluding experimental results and so on. Activeness is interrelated with learning discipline. Discipline is a predisposition position (tendency) a mental attitude to comply with rules, regulations, and at the same time control oneself, adjusting to rules that come from outside even though they are restrictive and show awareness of responsibility for duties and obligations (Ardiansyah, Asrori 2011). Learning must be done by students themselves, learning is experienced and cannot be delegated to others. Edgar Dale in the classification of learning experiences suggests that the best learning is learning through direct experience.

This is also what Jean Jacques Rousseau said that children have hidden potentials, through learning children must be given the opportunity to develop or actualize these potentials. In fact, children have their own power to seek, try, find and develop themselves. Thus, all that knowledge must be obtained by self-observation, own experience, self-investigation, self-work, and with self-created facilities. Learning will be more meaningful if students \"experience what they learn for themselves\" instead of \"knowing\" from the information conveyed. teacher, as stated by Nurhadi that students will study well if what they learn relates to what they already know, and the learning process will be productive if students are actively involved in the learning process at school. From the various views of these experts, it shows how important it is for students to be directly involved in the learning process. The importance of direct involvement in learning was put forward by John Dewey with his \"learning by doing\". Learning should be experienced through direct action and must be carried out by students actively. This principle is based on the assumption that students can gain more experience by being actively and proportionally involved, compared to when they only see material/concepts. The mode of learning experience is as follows: we learn 10% of what we read, 20% of what we hear, 30% of what we see, 50% of what we see and hear, 70% of what we say, and 90% of what we say and do.",

Conversely, if the teacher asks students to do something and report it, then they will remember as much as 90%. This has something to do with the opinion expressed by a Chinese philosopher Confocius, that: The principle of learning that emphasizes the need for repetition is the psychological theory of power. According to this theory, learning is training the powers that exist in humans which consist of the power to observe, respond, remember, imagine, feel, think and so on. By doing repetition, these powers will develop, just as a knife that is always being sharpened will become sharp, so the power that is trained by means of repetition will be perfect. In the learning process, the more often the subject matter is repeated, the more one remembers and sticks to that lesson. Repeating can be directly after reading, but also even more important is to review the material that has been studied for example by making a summary. Another theory that emphasizes the principle of repetition is Thordike's connectionism theory. In connectionism theory, he argued that learning is the establishment of a relationship between stimulus and response, and the repetition of these experiences increases the chances of a correct response occurring. Field theory (Field Theory) from Kurt Lewin suggests that students in learning are in a field. In learning situations students face a goal to be achieved, but there are always obstacles in studying learning materials, so motives arise to overcome these obstacles by studying these learning materials. If these obstacles have been overcome, it means that the learning objectives have been achieved, then he will be in a new field and new goals, and so on.",

        "paragraph": "According to this theory, learning is trying to overcome obstacles to achieve goals. In order for the child to have a strong motive to overcome obstacles well, the learning material must be challenging. The challenges faced in learning materials make students eager to overcome them. New learning materials that contain lots of problems that need to be solved make students challenged to learn them. The use of experimental, inquiry, discovery methods also provides a challenge for students to study more actively and seriously. Positive and negative reinforcement will also challenge students and generate motives to get rewards or avoid unpleasant punishments. The learning principle related to feedback and reinforcement is operant conditioning learning theory from B.F. Skinner. The key to this theory is Thordike's law of effect, the relationship between stimulus and response will increase when accompanied by feelings of pleasure or satisfaction and vice versa can disappear if accompanied by feelings of displeasure. This means that if an action has a good effect, then the action tends to be repeated. Conversely, if the action has a negative effect, it tends to be abandoned or not repeated. Students will learn more enthusiastically if they know and get good results. If the results are good, it will be a pleasant return and have a good effect on further learning efforts. However, the motivation to learn is not only pleasant but also unpleasant reinforcement, or in other words, positive and negative reinforcement can strengthen learning. Students who study seriously will get good grades in tests. Good grades encourage children to study harder. Good values \u200b\u200bcan be operant conditioning or positive reinforcement. On the other hand, a child who gets a bad grade at the time of the test will feel afraid of not going to class, because he is afraid of not going to class he is motivated to study harder.",

Calculus is the study of change, just as geometry studies shapes and algebra studies operations and their application to solving equations. Calculus has wide applications in science, economics, and engineering; and can solve various problems that cannot be solved with elementary algebra. Calculus has two main branches, differential calculus and integral calculus which are interconnected through the fundamental theorem of calculus. Examples of other branches of calculus are propositional calculus, calculus of variations, lambda calculus, and process calculus. Calculus lesson is a gateway to other higher mathematics lessons, which specifically study functions and limits, which are generally called mathematical analysis. The history of the development of calculus can be traced to several periods of time, namely ancient times, medieval times, and modern times. In the period of antiquity, some ideas about integral calculus had emerged, but they were not well developed and systematic. Calculations of volume and area which are the main functions of integral calculus can be traced back to the Egyptian Moscow Papyri (c. 1800 BC). On these papyri, the Egyptians were able to calculate the volume of a truncated pyramid. Archimedes took this idea further and created a heuristic that resembles integral calculus. In medieval times, the Indian mathematician Aryabhata used the concept of small infinity in 499 and expressed astronomical problems in the form of elementary differential equations. This equation then led Bh\u0101skara II in the 12th century to develop an initial form of the derivative that represented an infinitesimal change and explained an earlier form of \"Rolle's Theorem\". Around 1000, the Iraqi mathematician Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) was the first to derive a formula for calculating the product of the fourth power, and by using mathematical induction, he developed a method for deriving the general formula for the product of the power of the integral which was so important to the development of integral calculus .",

In modern times, independent discoveries were made in early 17th century Japan by mathematicians such as Seki Kowa. In Europe, mathematicians such as John Wallis and Isaac Barrow made breakthroughs in calculus. James Gregory proved a special case of the fundamental theorem of calculus in 1668. Leibniz and Newton pushed these ideas together as a unit and the two scientists are considered separate discoverers of calculus at about the same time. Newton applied general calculus to physics while Leibniz developed the calculus notations that are widely used today. When Newton and Leibniz published their results for the first time, there was controversy among mathematicians as to which was more deserving of credit for their work. Newton submitted his work first, but it was Leibniz who published it first. Newton accused Leibniz of stealing his ideas from unpublished notes, which Newton often lent to members of the Royal Society. A detailed examination shows that the two worked independently, with Leibniz starting from the integral and Newton from the derivative. Today, both Newton and Leibniz are credited with developing calculus independently. It was Leibniz who gave the name to this branch of mathematics as calculus, while Newton named it \"The science of fluxions\". Since then, many mathematicians have contributed to the further development of calculus. One of the most complete early works on finite and infinitesimal analysis was written in 1748 by Maria Gaetana Agnesi.",

The results of their work then gave a strong influence on the development of physics. Differential calculus applications include calculating velocity and acceleration, the slope of a curve, and optimization. Applications of integral calculus include calculating area, volume, arc length, center of mass, work, and pressure. Further applications include power series and Fourier series. Calculus is also used to gain a more detailed understanding of space, time, and motion. For centuries, mathematicians and philosophers have attempted to solve paradoxes involving the division of a number by zero or the sum of an infinite series. An ancient Greek philosopher gave several famous examples such as Zeno's paradox. Calculus provides solutions, especially in the field of limits and infinite series, which then successfully solves the paradox. Calculus is generally developed by manipulating a number of very small quantities. This object, which can be treated as a number, is infinitesimal. An infinitely small dx number can be greater than 0, but less than any number in the sequence 1, 12, 13, ... and any positive real number. Any multiplication by infinitesimal is still infinitely small, in other words, infinitesimal does not fulfill the \"Archimedes property\". From this point of view, calculus is a set of techniques for manipulating infinitesimals. In the 19th century, this small infinity concept was abandoned due to not being precise enough, instead it was replaced by the limit (mathematics) concept.

Its agricultural land was fertile, had several sources of water, and served as an important lookout for the defense of Judah's territory (cf. Jeremiah 6:1 ).

According to Christian Bible records (Amos 1:1), Amos worked during the reign of king Uzziah, from the Southern Kingdom and during the time of Jeroboam II, son of Joash, from the Northern Kingdom. At that time, the Northern Empire experienced its heyday, especially in the economic, military and political fields. However, Amos encounters many social injustices that are rife in society; extensive international trade for the benefit of the rulers; deceptive business practices against the poor and powerless; and confiscation of land belonging to the poor. At that time religious ceremonies continued to be maintained, but this was carried out in tandem with the nature of wickedness.

Amos attributed the injustice that was happening around him to his tendency to enrich himself and to ignore God's command to pay attention to the common good. Amos also conveyed criticism, warnings and threats against the living habits of people who only seek profit for themselves and do not remember God's work of love for them. In terms of religion, Amos expressed his criticism that their worship would not be pleasing if it was not based on an attitude of repentance and a living faith, and was reflected in human life with others. Because, God worked out salvation not only for Israel but also for all nations. Apart from that, one of the highlights in Amos's message is the loss of warnings about respect for gods/goddesses, which were characteristic of the criticisms of his contemporary prophets.

In fiqh books, the word jihad is generally studied in chapters that talk about war. That's why the meaning of jihad tends to deviate from its basic meaning. Meanwhile, scholars in the Western world often interpret \"jihad\" as a holy war in Islam because of the Christian view. This meaning makes jihad contain ideology and always associated with violence and fundamentalism. Jihad with wealth and life is commanded by Allah in Surah At-Taubah verse 41. This order applies to conditions that are light or heavy to carry out. Allah gives an advantage of one degree to His servants who strive with wealth and lives in war compared to those who do not participate in war. Under similar conditions, Allah has exalted the position of those who do jihad not with wealth and lives compared to those who do not do jihad at all. This information is obtained from Surah An-Nisa' verses 95-96. In Surah At-Taubah verse 111 it is stated that the reward for those who strive with their wealth and life is heaven. This is Allah's promise to those who strive with their wealth and lives. The meaning of the word Jihad is often misunderstood by people who are not familiar with Islamic principles as 'holy war' (holy war). the term war is jihad, qital means kill not war. Jihad in the form of war is carried out if there is slander that endangers the existence of the ummah, in the form of attacks from outside. Basically, the word jihad means \"to strive\" or \"to strive.\" Jihad does not always mean \"war\" in the \"physical\" sense. Today, jihad is more often defined as \"the struggle for religion\" rather than \"the struggle in physical form\".",

Tellurium is chemically related to selenium and sulfur, all three of which are chalcogens. It is sometimes found in its native form as elemental crystals. Tellurium is much more common in the Universe as a whole than it is on Earth. Its extreme rarity in the Earth's crust, comparable to that of platinum, is partly due to the formation of volatile hydrides which caused tellurium to be lost to space as a gas during Earth's formation, when conditions were very hot, and partly due to tellurium's low affinity for oxygen, which causes it to bind negatively. preferential to the other chalcophiles in the solid minerals that permeate the Earth's core. Tellurium-carrying compounds were first discovered in 1782 in a gold mine at Kleinschlatten, Transylvania (now Zlatna, Romania) by the Austrian mineralogist Franz-Joseph M\u00fcller von Reichenstein, although it was Martin Heinrich Klaproth who named the new element in 1798 after the Latin word for \" earth\", Tellus. The mineral gold telluride is the best-known naturally occurring gold compound. However, they are not a commercially significant source of tellurium, which is usually extracted as a by-product of copper and tin production. Commercially, the main use of tellurium is in copper (copper tellurium) and steel alloys, where it can improve machinability. Applications in CdTe solar panels and cadmium telluride semiconductors also consume a large part of tellurium production. Tellurium is considered a critical element for technology. Tellurium has no biological function, although fungi can use it in place of sulfur and selenium in amino acids such as eggocysteine \u200b\u200band egg-methionine. In humans, tellurium is partially metabolized to dimethyl tellurium, (CH3)2Te, a gas with a garlic-like odor that is exhaled in the breath of victims of tellurium exposure or poisoning.",

It is a brittle and easily crushed metalloid. Amorphous tellurium is a black-brown powder prepared by precipitation from a solution of telluric or telluric acid (Te(OH)6). Tellurium is a semiconductor that exhibits greater electrical conductivity in certain directions depending on the alignment of the atoms, its conductivity increasing slightly when exposed to light (photoconductivity). When molten, tellurium is corrosive to copper, iron, and stainless steel. Of the chalcogen, tellurium has the highest melting and boiling points, namely 72.266 K (129.619 \u00b0F) and 1.261 K (1.810 \u00b0F), respectively. Tellurium adopts a polymeric structure consisting of zig-zag chains of Te atoms. This gray material resists oxidation by air and is non-volatile. Naturally occurring tellurium has eight isotopes. Six of these isotopes, 120Te, 122Te, 123Te, 124Te, 125Te, and 126Te, are stable. The other two, 128Te and 130Te, were found to be slightly radioactive, with very long half-lives, 2.2\u00d71024 years for 128Te. It is the longest known half-life of all radionuclides and is about 160 trillion (1012) times the known age of the universe. Stable isotopes make up only 33.2% of all naturally occurring tellurium. Furthermore, 31 radioisotopes manufactured by tellurium are known, with atomic masses ranging from 104 to 142 and with half-lives of 19 days or less. Also, 17 nuclear isomers are known, with half-lives of up to 154 days. With the exception of the beryllium-8 and beta-delayed alpha emission branches in some lighter nuclides, tellurium (104Te to 109Te) is the lightest element with isotopes known to undergo alpha decay.",

With an abundance in the Earth's crust comparable to that of platinum (about 1 \u00b5g/kg), tellurium is one of the rarest stable solid elements. In comparison, even the rarest stable lanthanides have a crustal abundance of up to 500 \u00b5g/kg (see Abundance of chemical elements). The rarity of tellurium in the Earth's crust is not a reflection of its cosmic abundance. Tellurium is more abundant than rubidium in the cosmos, although it is 10,000 times more abundant in the Earth's crust. The rarity of tellurium on Earth is thought to be due to conditions during pre-accretion sorting in the solar nebula, when the stable forms of certain elements, in the absence of oxygen and water, were controlled by the reducing power of free hydrogen. In this scenario, certain elements that form volatile hydrides, such as tellurium, are highly depleted by evaporation of these hydrides. Tellurium and selenium are the heavy elements that are most depleted by this process. Tellurium is occasionally found in its native (i.e., elemental) form, but is more commonly found as gold tellurides such as calaverite and crennerite (two distinct polymorphs of AuTe2), petzit, Ag3AuTe2, and silvanite, AgAuTe4. The town of Telluride, Colorado, was named in hopes of a gold telluride rush (which never materialized, although ores of gold metal were found). Gold itself is usually found uncombined, but when it is found as a chemical compound, it is most often combined with tellurium. Although tellurium is found more often with gold than in its uncombined form, tellurium is found more frequently combined as tellurium of the more common metals (eg melonite, NiTe2). The naturally occurring minerals tellurite and tellurate also form, which are formed by the oxidation of tellurides near the Earth's surface. In contrast to selenium, tellurium does not usually replace sulfur in minerals because of the large difference in ionic radii.",

In the gold rush of 1893, miners in Kalgoorlie dumped pyrite as they searched for pure gold, and used it to fill pits and build sidewalks. In 1896, the waste was discovered to be calaverite, a golden telluride, and it sparked a second gold rush which included street mining. Tellurium (Latin tellus meaning \"earth\") was discovered in the 18th century in gold ore from mines at Kleinschlatten (now Zlatna), near the city of Alba Iulia, present-day Romania. This ore was known as \"Faczebajer wei\u00dfes bl\u00e4ttriges Golderz\" (the white-leaved gold ore from Faczebaja, German name Faceb\u00e1nya, now Fa\u021ba B\u0103ii in Province of Alba) or antimonalischer Goldkies (antimonic gold pyrite), and according to Anton von Rupprecht, was Spie\u00dfglask\u00f6nig ( argent molybdique ) , which contains natural antimony. In 1782 Franz-Joseph M\u00fcller von Reichenstein, then chief inspector of Austrian mines in Transylvania, concluded that the ore contained not antimony but bismuth sulfide. The following year, he reported that this was a mistake and that the ore contained mostly gold and an unknown metal very similar to antimony. After a thorough investigation that spanned three years and included more than fifty tests, M\u00fcller determined the mineral's specific gravity and noted that when heated, the new metal gave off white smoke with a horseradish odor; that it gives a red color to sulfuric acid; and when this solution is diluted with water, it has a black precipitate. However, he was unable to identify the metal and gave it the names aurum paradoxium (paradoxical gold) and metalum problematicum (problem metal), because they did not exhibit the properties predicted for antimony.",

In 1798, the element was named by Martin Heinrich Klaproth, who had previously isolated it from the mineral calaverite. The 1960s saw increasing thermoelectric applications for tellurium (in the form tellurium bismuth), and in free machining steel alloys, where it is its predominant use. The largest consumers of tellurium are metallurgical iron, stainless steel, copper and tin alloys. Addition of tellurium to steel and copper results in alloys that are easier to work with. Tellurium is alloyed into cast iron to provide cooling for spectroscopy, where the presence of electrically conductive free graphite is likely to interfere with spark emission test results. In lead, tellurium increases strength and durability, and reduces the corrosive action of sulfuric acid. Tellurium is used in cadmium telluride (CdTe) solar panels. National Renewable Energy Laboratory lab tests on tellurium show some examples of the greatest efficiency for solar cell power generation. First Solar's large commercial production of CdTe solar panels in recent years has significantly increased demand for tellurium. Replacing some of the cadmium in CdTe with zinc, producing (Cd,Zn)Te, provides a solid X-ray detector, providing an alternative to single-use film badges. Infrared sensitive semiconductor materials are formed by alloying tellurium with cadmium and mercury to form mercury cadmium telluride. Organotellurium compounds such as dimethyl telluride, diethyl telluride, diisopropyl telluride, diallyl telluride and methyl allyl telluride are precursors for the synthesis of metalorganic vapor phase epitaxial growth from semiconductor compounds II-VI.

In general, liquids form crystals when they undergo a solidification process. Under ideal conditions, the result could be a single crystal, in which all the atoms in the solid are \"attached\" to the same lattice or crystal structure. While, in general, most crystals form simultaneously resulting in a polycrystalline solid. Which crystal structure will form from a liquid depends on the chemical structure of the liquid itself, the conditions under which solidification occurred, and the ambient pressure. The process of forming a crystalline structure is known as crystallization. Although the cooling process often produces crystalline materials, under certain circumstances the liquid may freeze in a non-crystalline form. In many cases, this is due to cooling too fast for the atoms to reach their lattice locations. A non-crystalline material is usually called an amorphous or glassy material. Sometimes such materials are also referred to as amorphous solids, although there is a distinct difference between solids and glasses. The process of forming glass does not release specific heat of melting (English: latent heat of fusion). For this reason, many scientists consider glass materials to be liquids, not solids. This topic is controversial, please see glass for further discussion. Crystal structures occur in all classes of materials, with all types of chemical bonds. Almost all metallic bonds exist in the polycrystalline state; amorphous metals or single crystals have to be produced synthetically, with great difficulty. Ionic-bonded crystals can form when salts solidify, either from melting liquids or condensing solutions. Covalent bond crystals are also very common. Examples are diamond, silica, and graphite.

Most crystalline materials have various types of crystallographic defects. The type and structure of the defects can have a major effect on the properties of the material. Although the term \"crystal\" has a defined meaning in materials science and solids physics, in everyday life, the term \"crystal\" refers to solid objects that exhibit a certain geometric shape, and are often pleasing to the eye. Various forms of these crystals can be found in nature. The forms of crystals depend on the type of molecular bonds between atoms (to determine their structure) and the circumstances in which the crystals were created. Snowflakes, diamonds, and table salt are all examples of crystals. Some crystalline materials may exhibit special electrical properties, such as the ferroelectric effect or the piezoelectric effect. The behavior of light in a crystal is described in crystal optics. Within the periodic dielectric structure, a series of unique optical properties can be found that are described in photonic crystals. Single crystals are also referred to as monocrystalline, which is a crystalline solid that has a crystal lattice that is regularly arranged continuously and the crystal lattice that forms the frame is not damaged or the structure remains intact. According to Milligan (1979),\u00a0a single crystal\u00a0is a solid in which the atoms in its molecules are arranged in a repeatability where some crystalline solids are composed of millions of single crystals called grains. In the process of forming the crystal structure, in the science of crystallography it is explained in two ways, namely hcp (hexagonal close-packed) in which crystals are formed in the order of atoms ABABAB and so on and the order in which other crystals are formed is ccp (cubic close-packed) in which the order of the atoms forming them is is ABCABC and so on.

Crystals can form from the deposition process. A precipitate is a substance that separates as a solid phase out of solution and forms crystals. The size of the crystals formed during precipitation depends on two important factors, namely the rate of nucleation and the rate of crystal growth. The rate of nucleation can be expressed by the number of nuclei formed in a unit of time. If the nucleation rate is high, lots of crystals will form but with small sizes. Meanwhile, if the crystal growth rate is high, crystals with a high size will be obtained. A crystal can be classified based on the arrangement of its particles and can also be based on the type of constituent particles or the interactions that combine these particles. A crystal with a lattice consisting of metal atoms held together by metallic bonds. Metal atoms are atoms that have a small ionization energy so that their valence electrons are easily released and cause the atoms to form cations. When two metal atoms approach each other, the orbitals overlap to form a molecular orbital.

One of the properties of metal crystals is that they are malleable. This property is obtained from the metal bonds that form it. In metallic bonds, there is an interaction between the atoms/ions and the free electrons around them so that the metal can maintain its structure when a strong force is applied. Ionic crystals form due to the attractive force between positively and negatively charged ions. Generally, ionic crystals have a high melting point and low electrical conductivity. An example of an ionic crystal is NaCl. Ionic crystals do not have a specific direction like covalent crystals, so in NaCl crystals, for example, sodium ions will interact with all chloride ions with various interaction intensities and chloride ions will interact with all sodium ions. The atoms that make up a covalent crystal are repeatedly bonded through a covalent bond to form a crystal with a structure similar to that of a polymer or giant molecule. Examples of covalent crystals are diamond and silicon dioxide (SiO2) or quartz. Diamond has a hardness property that comes from the formation of covalent bonds of sp3 hybridized carbon atom orbitals. In general, crystals form from some type of chemical bond between atoms or ions. However, in the case of molecular crystals, crystals are formed without the aid of bonds, but through weak interactions between the molecules. One example of a molecular crystal is the iodine crystal. Crystallography is the scientific study of the crystal structure (in other words, the arrangement of atoms) of crystals. One of the most widely used crystallographic techniques is X-ray diffraction. A large number of known crystal structures are stored in crystallographic databases.

Ethnobiologists investigate what biological resources are used, for what purposes, the specific techniques of use, the reasons for choosing these biological resources, and their symbolic and spiritual implications. Different societies classify their biological resources in different ways. Ethnobiologists attempt to record the words used in certain cultures for living things, from the most specific terms (analogous to species names in Linnean biology) to more general terms (such as 'tree' and even more generally 'plant'). . They also try to understand the overall structure or hierarchy of a classification system (if there is one; there is debate about whether there should always be a hierarchy). Societal orders instill meaning in their life and world on questions such as 'how was the world formed? ', 'why were humans created? ', 'which is the better way to do it and why? ', and 'does reality exist outside or behind our physical experience?'. Understanding the meaning of cosmology, morality, or spirituality from a societal perspective is important for cultural research in general, and ethnobiologists investigate how people's views of the natural world inform and are informed by them. In order to live effectively in a place, a society understands things from the environment, and many traditional societies have complex and wise understandings about the places where they live. Ethnobiologists seek to share that understanding, subject to ethical concerns regarding intellectual property and cultural appropriation. Ethnobotany investigates the relationship between people and plants: how humans use plants\u2013as food, technology, medicine, and in ritual contexts; how humans view and understand it; and their symbolic and spiritual role in a culture.",

The scope and precise definition of the term Islamophobia, including its relation to race, has been the subject of much debate. Some scholars consider it a form of xenophobia or racism, while others argue that there is no connection between them; especially on the basis that religion is not the same as race. The causes of Islamophobia are also a topic of debate, especially among commentators who present their own arguments. Some of the reasons stated were the September 11 attacks, the rise of militant groups such as ISIS, terror attacks in various places, the increase in the Muslim population in Europe and the United States because their governments accepted refugees from conflict areas in the Middle East and Africa, the imposition of Islamic law, and others. A number of parties criticize the concept of Islamophobia by saying that this term is an attempt to silence criticism of Islam. Renowned novelist Salman Rushdie and several of his colleagues signed a manifesto entitled \"Together against new forms of totalitarianism\" in March 2006, calling Islamophobia \"an absurd concept that mixes criticism of Islam as a religion with the stigmatization of its adherents.\" Turkey's request to become a member of the European Union has been held since 1987, but did not materialize due to problems with the head of government. At that time, Turkey was under the government of Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. The European Union rejected Turkey's request to join because Erdo\u011fan has authoritarian powers and has problems with human rights. In the view of critical discourse, the rejection of Turkey's membership in the European Union is also influenced by the spread of Islamophobia in the minds of European society.

And it cannot be changed and has been insured since ancient times. When it is absolute, it contains the meaning of qadar and vice versa, when the term qadar is absolute, it contains the meaning of qada. However, when it is said \"qadha-qadar\", then there is a difference between the two. This happens a lot in Arabic. One word can have a broad meaning when alone and have a special meaning when put together (collected). As an example can be said. \"If the two are united then they are different and if the two are separated then they are united\" So the words qada and qadar are included in this condition, meaning that if the word qada is separated (from the word qadar), then it contains qadar and vice versa the word qadar when separated (from the word qada) then contains the meaning of qada. However, when collected, the word qada means something that Allah has ordained for His creatures, whether in the form of creation, annihilation or change. Meanwhile, qadar means something that has been determined by Allah since time immemorial. This is the difference between the two terms. So qadar comes first then followed by qada. Namely believing that Allah knows what has happened and what will happen; define and write it in lauhul mahfudz; and that everything that happens, good or bad, disbelief, faith, ta'at, ma'shiyat, has been willed, determined and created by Him; and that Allah loves obedience and hates evil.

Epidemiology is a cornerstone of public health, which shapes decision-making in public policy and evidence-based practice by identifying risk factors for disease and identifying disease prevention goals. Epidemiologists assist with study design, collection and statistical analysis of data, making interpretations, and disseminating findings (including occasional peer reviews and systematic reviews). Epidemiology has helped develop methodologies used in clinical research, public health research, and, to a lesser extent, basic research in biology. The main areas of epidemiological study include disease causation, disease transmission, outbreak investigation, disease surveillance, environmental epidemiology, forensic epidemiology, occupational epidemiology, screening, biological monitoring, and comparison of treatment effects as in clinical trials. Epidemiologists rely on other disciplines such as biology to better understand disease processes, statistics to utilize data efficiently and draw appropriate conclusions, social sciences to better understand proximate and proximate causes, and engineering for exposure assessment. Epidemiology, literally \"the study of what is in people\", comes from the Greek epi, meaning 'amongst', and demos, meaning 'people, district', and logos, meaning 'study, word , discourse', thus showing that epidemiology only applies to human populations. However, the term is widely used in the study of animal populations (veterinary epidemiology), despite the availability of the term \"epizoology\", and has also been applied to the study of plant populations (plant disease epidemiology). The distinction between \"epidemic\" and \"endemic\" was first expressed by Hippocrates, to distinguish between diseases that \"visit\" a population (epidemic) and diseases that \"live in\" a population (endemic).",

Animals that are widely raised include cows, chickens. goats, sheep and pigs. Livestock products include meat, milk, eggs, and clothing materials (such as wool). In addition, manure can fertilize the soil and animal power can be used as a means of transportation and for plowing the land. Things that include livestock activities include feeding, breeding or breeding to look for superior traits, maintenance, health care and utilization of the results. Livestock can be divided into extensive or intensive farming, and there are also semi-intensive farms that combine the two. In extensive farming, animals are allowed to roam and find food on their own, sometimes over large areas of land, and sometimes with supervision so that they are not predated. In intensive animal husbandry, especially the factory farms common in developed countries, animals are housed in high-density buildings, their food is brought in from outside, and their lives are regulated so as to have high production and efficiency. Livestock started since the domestication of animals (animal cultivation so that it can be maintained and utilized by humans) in a process that began around 13,000 BC. Different types of animals began to be domesticated at different times and places in history. Apart from the livestock mentioned above, other animals such as horses, buffaloes, camels, llamas, alpacas, and rabbits are also raised in several parts of the world. Livestock also includes aquaculture to raise aquatic animals such as fish, shrimp and shellfish. Insect farming is also carried out in several places, such as beekeeping, silkworms, and even crickets which are used as food in Thailand.

In addition, the animals can be fed high-energy and high-protein foods, such as cereal crops and artificial feed. Non-ruminant animals cannot eat grass and so must eat from other sources. In modern times, the impact of livestock on the environment has begun to be highlighted, because livestock activities require a lot of water and land, both for livestock and for the plants that are grown as food. In addition, livestock emit greenhouse gases such as methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and carbon dioxide (CO2). There are also concerns for animal welfare especially with the increase in factory farming. Initially, animal husbandry was part of the life of self-sufficient farmers, with the aim of not only being a source of food for farming families but also a source of fertilizer, clothing, means of transportation, manpower for use, and fuel. Initially, animals were used as much as possible while alive to produce eggs, milk, wool, even blood (for example, by the Maasai), and eating animals was not the main goal in itself. In a nomadic lifestyle called transhumans, humans and livestock move between several areas of habitation seasonally. For example, in the montane region they live in the mountains in the summer and in the valleys in the winter. Husbandry can be done extensively (outside) or intensively (in the cage). In extensive farming, animals may roam, sometimes free or sometimes under the supervision of a farmer or herder to protect them from predators. In North America there is a ranch (English) or rancho (Spanish) system, in which large publicly or privately owned plots of land are used to graze large numbers of cattle. There are also similar grazing areas in South America, Australia, or other places with large areas of land and little rain.",

In the high areas of Great Britain, the sheep are brought up into the mountains in the spring and left free to graze, then brought down towards the end of the year and given extra food in the winter. In rural areas, livestock such as poultry and pigs can live by foraging for food scraps. In some African communities, chickens can go months without food and still lay one or two eggs per week. On the other hand, animals are also often raised intensively, especially in developed countries that apply factory farms. Dairy cows are penned and their food is brought in from outside, beef cattle are fattened in special stalls with high density. Pigs are kept in temperature controlled buildings, and have never been outside during their lives. Poultry animals are kept in cages and bars in a light controlled room. Between these two sides there is also semi-intensive farming, which is a mix between intensive and extensive farming. An example is a family farm where the animals alternate between eating from the wild and eating the feed the farmer has prepared. Sometimes this happens seasonally, the animals are allowed to eat outside most of the year, but when the grass no longer grows the animals are fed hay, fodder, or other materials brought in from outside. Most farm animals are herbivores or plant eaters; omnivorous livestock including chickens or pigs. There are herbivorous animals that eat grass (such as cows), eat high-nutrition materials such as seeds, fruit and young leaves, as well as eat various parts of plants (such as goats).

The nutritional needs of ruminants can be met for the most part by eating grass. Grass can grow from its base, so even though it is eaten a lot, it still lives and grows again. In certain climates, grass does not grow all year round, for example only in summer or during the rainy season, so the grass is mowed and stored for later, for example in the form of straw (dry grass) or silage (fermented grass). Other forage crops can also be grown and stored as a food additive for lean seasons. Animals in extensive systems can obtain their nutrients only from nature, but intensively farmed animals usually require additional energy- and protein-rich foods. Energy is usually obtained from cereals such as rice or corn (and processed products), fats, oils, and foods rich in sugar. Protein comes from feed made from fish or meat, dairy products, nuts, or processed ingredients from plants. Animals that are not ruminants such as poultry or pigs cannot digest cellulose in grass, so they must be given other feeds, for example from cereals. Animal feed can be grown on the farm or purchased in the form of products which are sometimes specified according to the type of animal, growth period, or special nutritional needs. Vitamins and minerals can be added to make the feed balanced. Breeding of livestock often does not occur spontaneously but is controlled by breeders who want their offspring to have certain characteristics.

In addition, breeders avoid unwanted traits such as disease or aggressive behavior. Livestock breeding, i.e. breeding livestock to look for desired traits, plays a role in increasing livestock production sharply. In 2007, the average eight-week-old broiler weight was nearly five times the weight of the animal in 1957. In the 30 years to 2007, cow's milk production in the United States nearly doubled. An important factor in the health of livestock is good care, proper food and hygiene. Economically, efforts to maintain livestock health will generate benefits in the form of more optimal production. If the livestock has a disease, veterinary science can be used to treat it, either by the farmer himself or by a veterinarian. In some countries, such as in the European Union, when farmers self-medicate their livestock, they are still required to follow existing rules and record the actions taken. There are common diseases that infect farm animals. Some only infect certain animals, for example, swine cholera, which only affects pigs, or foot and mouth disease, which affects various hoofed animals. In severe conditions, the government can take action by limiting imports or exports, limiting the movement of livestock, implementing quarantine, and requiring reports of suspected diseases. Some diseases can be prevented by vaccination, and some can be treated with antibiotics. Antibiotics were once added to feed to aid growth, but this practice is now being avoided in many countries as it increases the risk of antibiotic resistance.

The outbreak of Nipah virus infection in Malaysia in 1999 originated from pigs that had contact with bats and their feces and urine. These pigs are infected with a disease which then spreads to humans. H5N1 bird flu originates from wild bird populations and can spread over long distances through migratory birds. This virus easily spreads to poultry, and to humans who live near these birds. Other diseases that can be transmitted to humans from farmed and wild animals are rabies, leptospirosis, brucellosis, tuberculosis, and trichinosis. There is no universal definition that determines which animals are considered farm animals.

Manure can be used as a source of fertilizer, thereby returning some of the minerals and organic matter that livestock consumed to the system and helping to regrow its own food.

The types of animals eaten depend on local preferences and customs, availability, cost and other factors. Cattle, goats, sheep and pigs are the species most commonly raised for meat. These animals have different breeding rates. Cows usually give birth to only one calf and take more than a year to mature; goats and sheep often have twins and can be slaughtered before one year of age; Pigs are very fertile animals and can produce up to 11 children each year.

Cows are not only kept for milking but also as a source of energy (to pull vehicles or to plow fields), their dung is used to fertilize the soil, and to produce other products such as meat, skin or hair which can be sheared and spun. In modern animal husbandry, through breeding have emerged edge-type dairy cattle which produce very large amounts of milk, such as the Holstein breed which is known to be very economical. Breeders can perform artificial insemination to mate animals to produce superior offspring or match the breeder's conditions. Goats and sheep are also sometimes raised to produce milk if the climate or local conditions do not permit dairy farming.

Poultry farming methods vary from extensive systems where the birds are free to roam and only housed at night for safety reasons, or semi-intensive systems where the birds are kept in large pens or fences that allow the birds to roam or roost, to intensive systems which keep the birds in a cage. One method used in intensive farming is the battery cage system, where birds are housed in narrow multilevel cages with special systems for feeding, drinking and egg retrieval. Economically, this method has high egg production and is labor-efficient, but has been criticized by animal welfare advocates because the birds in this system cannot follow their natural lifestyle. In developed countries, broiler chickens are mostly kept indoors, using large cages with strictly regulated conditions using automatic equipment. Broiler or broiler chickens are usually reared in this way, and through genetic cultivation these animals can be ready for slaughter within six or seven weeks of age. In this system, newly hatched chicks are kept in a small cage and given artificial heating. Their droppings are absorbed by the bottom of the coop and the space is expanded as the chicks grow.

Cattle were domesticated from their ancestors, the wild animals aurochs or urus in what is now Turkey and Pakistan around 8,500 BC.

Soon, two types of camels were domesticated, the two-humped Bactrian camel in Mongolia and the one-humped Arabian camel, which was used as a pack animal. By 1000 BC, caravans or caravans relying on camels became the backbone of trade between India and the Mesopotamian and Mediterranean regions.

Innovations in the plow allowed the land to be plowed even deeper. Horses replaced cattle as the primary draft animal, new ideas for crop rotation emerged, and the practice of growing crops to store for winter fodder became widespread. Various types of legumes began to be planted; this plant increases soil fertility because it can fix nitrogen, thus allowing a larger number of livestock.

Many children's stories depict farm animals like humans, such as wearing clothes, owning a house, walking upright, and carrying out human-like activities. These stories also often depict the animals roaming freely in beautiful rural lands, although this description does not correspond to the treatment of animals in modern intensive animal husbandry. The English song \"Old MacDonald Had a Farm\" (which has been translated into several languages) tells of a farmer named MacDonald who owns various livestock; this song sings the distinctive sound of each of these animals. An example of a farm animal in world children's fiction is the pig, which appears in the English children's book by Beatrix Potter, or as Piglet in A. A. Milne's Winnie the Pooh. Some stories, such as The Sheep-Pig by Dick King-Smith or Charlotte's Web by E. B. White, give some foreshadowing that these pigs will be butchered. In general, in world literature the pig is often \"the bringer of joy, antics and innocence.\" In some urban areas children often never see farm animals in person, so there are special \"touch parks\", \"interactive farms\", or \"zoos\" that allow children to interact with farm animals that are still alive and touch them. In the UK, around five million people visit parks or farms like these each year.",

Originating from tropical America, this plant has been introduced to Java for hundreds of years for agricultural and forestry purposes, and then spread to other islands in Indonesia. This plant in Malaysia is called petai grasshopper. This plant is also known by various other names such as p\u0115l\u0115nding, peuteuy s\u00e9long (Sd.); tembara/temporo, kemlandingan, m\u00e8tir, lamtoro and lamtoro gung (large lamtoro; for varieties with larger bodies) (Jw.); and kalandhingan, lantoro (Md.). Its names are in various foreign languages, including: petai grasshopper, petai Jawa (Mly.); lamandro (PNG); ipil-ipil, elena, kariskis (Phil.); krathin (Thai); leucaena, white leadtree (Eng. ); and leucaene, faux mimosa (Prc.). The species name, leucocephala (='white-headed') refers to the whitish flower heads. Trees or shrubs up to 20 m high; although mostly only about 2-10 m. The branches are low and numerous, with brown or grayish bark, nodules and lenticels. The twigs are round piston, with tightly haired ends. The leaves are compound and double-pinnate, fins numbering 3-10 pairs, mostly with glands on the leaf axis just before the base of the lower fin; small pedestal leaves, triangular shape. Leaflets per fin 5-20 pairs, opposite, oblong-striped, 6-16 (-21) mm \u00d7 1-2 (-5) mm, with pointed tip and sloping base (unequal), smooth hairy surface and frayed edge .

The seeds are similar to petai, but smaller in size and have a smaller cross-section. Lamtoro comes from Mexico and Central America, and from there then spread widely. Spanish conquistadors brought its seeds from there to the Philippines at the end of the 16th century. From this place, lamtoro began to spread to various parts of the world. Lamtoro is planted as a shade for coffee plants, as a producer of firewood, as well as a fast-growing source of fodder. Lamtoro is adaptable, and quickly this plant becomes wild in various tropical regions of Asia and Africa; including in Indonesia. There are three subspecies, namely: For a long time, the lamtoro has been used as a shade tree, erosion control, a source of firewood and animal feed. On fairly fertile soils, lamtoro grow quickly and can reach their adult size (13\u201318 m high) within 3 to 5 years. Dense stands (more than 5000 trees/ha) can produce increments of 20 to 60 m\u00b3 of wood per hectare per year. Trees planted alone can grow to a height of 50 cm.

This plant can also be used for green manure -by immersing the pruned leaves as fertilizer in the soil. Lamtoro is one of the most versatile types of legumes grown in mixed cropping patterns (agroforestry). The tree is often planted in rows 3\u201310 m apart, between rows of staple crops. Other uses are as living fences, firebreaks, windbreaks, green belts, living vines for twining plants such as pepper, vanilla, passion fruit and gadung, as well as shade trees in coffee and cocoa plantations. In teak plantations managed by Perhutani in Java, lamtoro is often planted as an intercrop to control soil erosion and increase soil fertility. The roots of the lamtoro have root nodules where nitrogen is fixed and produce leaves as an organic source. Lamtoro is very popular as a producer of firewood. Lamtoro wood has a calorific value of 19,250 kJ/kg, burns slowly and produces little smoke and ash. Lamtoro wood charcoal is of very good quality, with a calorific value of 48,400 kJ/kg. The wood is dense for a fast-growing tree (density 500\u2013600 kg/m\u00b3) and the moisture content of wet wood is between 30\u201350%, depending on its age. Lamtoro is quite easy to dry with good results, and easy to work with. Unfortunately, this wood is rarely large; branch-free stems are generally short and many knots, because this tree has many branches. The heartwood is reddish brown or golden, medium textured, quite hard and strong as wood for tools, furniture, poles or floor coverings.

Lamtoro is also a good producer of pulp, which is suitable for paper or rayon production. The wood yields 50-52% pulp, with low lignin content and 1.1-1.3 mm long wood fibers. The quality of the paper obtained is good. The leaves and young branches of the lamtoro are animal feed and a good source of protein, especially for ruminants. These leaves have a digestibility rate of 60 to 70% in ruminants, the highest among legumes and other tropical forage species. Lamtoro planted quite tightly and managed properly can produce high amounts of forage. However, mixed cropping of lamtoro (5\u20138 m spacing) with grass planted in between will provide the most economical results. Cattle and goats produce good weight gain with a forage composition in the form of a mixture of grass and 20-30% lamtoro. Although all livestock like lamtoro, the high content of mimosin can cause hair loss in non-ruminant animals, such as horses and pigs, which are usually given fresh. In addition, if the cow is given lamtoro for 6 months continuously, then the cow in question will experience hair loss, decreased fertility (fertility), disorders of the thyroid gland, and cataracts. Mimosin, a type of amino acid, is contained in the leaves and seeds of lamtoro up to 4% dry weight. In ruminants, mimosin is broken down in the stomach by a type of bacteria, Synergistes jonesii. Heating and administration of iron-sulfur salts can also reduce the toxicity of mimosin. Young leaves, flower buds and pods are usually eaten raw or cooked first.

Meanwhile, the fat content reaches 80.86 mg/g, still inferior to the fat content of soybeans which reaches 141.05 mg/g. The leaves are also often used as mulch and green manure. Lamtoro leaves quickly decompose. Lamtoro is known to produce tanning agents and red, brown and black dyes from its bark, leaves and pods. A kind of resin or gum is also produced from injured or diseased stems, especially from crosses of L. leucocephala \u00d7 L. esculenta. This gum has good quality, similar to gum arabic. Flowering all year round, lamtoro provides good forage for honey bees, making it suitable to support apiculture. From lamtoro, a necklace can also be made (the material consists of old lamtoro seeds, needles and thread). Meanwhile, the lamtoro seeds used are old seeds.

Also, in Cilacap, lamtoro fruit mixed with taro bark can be used to treat knife cuts. Following are some studies in the field of medicinal plants regarding lamtoro: Lamtoro likes a warm tropical climate (daily temperature 25-30\u00b0C); altitude above 1000 m above sea level can inhibit its growth. This plant is quite drought tolerant and can be planted everywhere, including in areas with rainfall between 650-3,000 mm (optimally 800-1,500 mm) per year. However, this plant cannot grow in standing water. Can be planted in any soil conditions, easily adapts to the local climate, lamtoro plants are easily propagated by old seeds, stem cuttings, and by transplanting tillers. Because it is easy to grow, in many places lamtoro often becomes a weed. This plant is also easy to grow; after being pruned, cut down or burned, the shoots will grow back in large quantities. Not many pests attack this plant, but the lamtoro is especially susceptible to attacks by hopping pests (Heteropsylla cubana) and planthopper pests. Planthopper pest attacks have almost destroyed lamtoro. In addition, the attack by fleas in Indonesia in the late 1980s resulted in the extinction of the 'local' species of lamtoro in many places. Another record says that this gung/petai cina lamtoro entered Indonesia after the common lamtoro (Leucaena diversifolia) was attacked by fleas in Indonesia in the 1980s.",

The name \"coelacanth\" is derived from the name of a genus of coelacanth from the Perem Period, Coelacanthus, which was the first coelacanth to be scientifically named. Coelacanths descend from the oldest lineage of Sarcopterigii (flesh-finned fish and tetrapods), meaning they are more closely related to lungfish and tetrapods such as amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals than to Actinopterigii (thorn-finned fish which includes almost all modern fish). ). Coelacanths belong to the subclass Actinistia, a group of flesh-finned fish related to lungfish and several extinct fish orders from the Devonian Period, such as Osteolepiformes, Porolepiformes, Rhizodontida, and Panderichthyidae. Previously, the coelacanth was thought to have become extinct since the Late Cretaceous, which is about 66 million years ago, but was rediscovered in 1983 off the coast of South Africa. The word \"coelacanth\" is an English loanword from the Modern Latin C\u0153lacanthus (\"hollow thorn\"), from the Greek \u03ba\u03bf\u1fd6\u03bb-\u03bf\u03c2 (koilos, \"hollow\") and \u1f04\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03b8-\u03b1 (akantha, \"thorn\"), referring to the caudal fin spine. hollow in the first fossil specimen described and named by Louis Agassiz in 1839. The genus name Latimeria is a tribute to Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer who discovered the first specimen. Until now, there have been 2 living species of Coelacanth found, namely the Comoros Coelacanth, Latimeria chalumnae and the Sulawesi Coelacanth (Manado), Latimeria menadoensis. Until 1938, this fish, which is closely related to the lung fish, was thought to have become extinct since the end of the Cretaceous Period, about 65 million years ago.",

A local ichthyologist (fish expert), Dr. J.L.B. Smith then described the fish and published his article in the journal Nature in 1939. He gave the name Latimeria chalumnae to the new type of fish, in memory of the museum curator and where the fish was found. In front of Ms. Courtenay-Latimer, East London museum curator. ]]The search for the location where this ancient fish lived for the next dozen years then found the waters of the Comoros Islands in the western Indian Ocean as its habitat, where several hundred individuals are estimated to live at sea depths of more than 150 m. Outside the islands, until the 1990s several individuals were also caught in the waters of Mozambique, Madagascar and also South Africa. But all of them are still considered part of the population more or less the same. In 1998, 60 years after the discovery of a living fossil of the Comoros coelacanth, a sea king fish was caught in fishermen's nets in the waters of Manado Tua Island, North Sulawesi. This fish has been known by local fishermen for a long time, but its existence there has not been known by the world of science. The sea kingfish is physically similar to the Comoros coelacanth, with differences in color. Namely the sea king is brown, while the Comoros coelacanth is steel blue. The sea king fish was then sent to an American researcher living in Manado, Mark Erdmann, along with two of his colleagues, R.L. Caldwell and Moh. Kasim Moosa from LIPI.

The existence of this city began when Sinuhun Paku Buwana II, king of the Islamic Mataram Sultanate, moved the position of king from Kartasura to Sala Village, a village not far from the bank of Bengawan Solo, because Kartasura's palace was destroyed due to an attack by rebels. Sunan Pakubuwana II bought land from the village chief of Sala Village, namely Kyai Sala, for 10,000 ringgit (Dutch guilders) to build a new Mataram palace. Officially, the new Islamic Mataram palace was called the Surakarta Hadiningrat Palace and began to be occupied on February 20, 1745. The Giyanti Agreement signed by Sinuhun Paku Buwana III, the Netherlands, and Prince Mangkubumi on February 13, 1755 divided the Mataram area into two, namely the Surakarta Sunanate and Yogyakarta Sultanate. Furthermore, the territory of the Surakarta Sunanate decreased, because the Salatiga Agreement held on March 17, 1757 caused Raden Mas Said to be recognized as an independent prince with a territory with duchy status, which was called the Kadipaten Mangkunegaran Surakarta (Pura Mangkunegaran Surakarta).

The joule is the SI unit for energy, derived from the amount exerted on an object (through mechanical work) by moving it 1 meter with a force of 1 newton. Work and heat are 2 examples of processes or mechanisms that can transfer large amounts of energy. The second law of thermodynamics limits the amount of work that can be gained through the heating process\u2014some of it is lost as wasted heat. The maximum amount that can be used for work is called available energy. Systems such as machines and living things need available energy, not just any energy. Mechanical energy and other forms of energy can be transferred directly to thermal energy without any restrictions. There are various forms of energy, but all of these types of energy must meet various conditions such as being able to be converted to other forms of energy, obeying the law of conservation of energy, and causing changes in the object of mass that is subjected to that energy. Common forms of energy include kinetic energy from moving objects, radiant energy from light and electromagnetic radiation, potential energy stored in an object due to its position such as gravitational fields, electric fields or magnetic fields, and heat energy which is composed of microscopic potential and kinetic energy. of the random particle motions. Some specific forms of potential energy are elastic energy caused by the elongation or deformation of solid objects and chemical energy such as the release of heat when fuel burns.

For example, adding 25 kilowatt-hours (90 megajoules) of energy to an object increases its mass by 1 microgram; if there is a balance that is so sensitive then this increase in mass can be seen. The sun converts nuclear potential energy into other forms of energy; its total mass will change when energy is released around it, especially in the form of radiant energy. Although energy can change form, the law of the conservation of energy states that the total energy of a system changes only when energy is transferred into or out of the system. This means that it is impossible to create or destroy energy. The total energy of a system can be calculated by adding up all forms of energy in the system. Examples of energy transfer and transformation are the generation of electricity, chemical reactions, or raising objects. Living organisms also need available energy to stay alive; humans for example, need energy from food along with oxygen to metabolize it. Civilization needs a supply of energy for various activities; Energy sources such as fossil fuels are an important topic in economics and politics. Earth's climate and ecosystems are also powered by radiant energy obtained from the sun (as well as geothermal energy obtained from within the earth. The word energy comes from the Ancient Greek: \u1f10\u03bd\u03ad\u03c1\u03b3\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1, translit. energeia, lit. 'activity, operation', which probably first appeared in the work of Aristotle in the 4th century BC.In contrast to the modern definition, energeia is a very broad, qualitative philosophical concept.In the late 17th century, Gottfried Leibniz proposed the Latin idea: vis viva, or lifestyle, defined as the multiplication of the mass of an object by the square of its velocity; he believed that the total vis viva was conserved. To account for the deceleration due to friction, Leibniz theorized that thermal energy consisted of the random motion of the parts that make up matter, although in the end this would take more than a century to complete. generally accepted.",

        "paragraph": "The modern analogy of this quantity (kinetic energy) differs only by a factor of one and a half. In 1807, Thomas Young was probably the first to use the term \"energy\" instead of vis viva. Gustave-Gaspard Coriolis described \"kinetic energy\" in 1829, and William Rankine coined the term \"potential energy\" in 1853. The law of the conservation of energy was also first postulated in the early 19th century, and applies to all isolated systems. It has been debated whether heat is a physical substance or not, or is it just a physical quantity such as momentum. In 1845 James Prescott Joule discovered the relationship between mechanical work and the appearance of heat. This development gave rise to the theory of the conservation of energy, formally formulated by William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) in thermodynamics. Thermodynamics provided an explanation for the development of chemical processes by Rudolf Clausius, Josiah Willard Gibbs, and Walther Nernst. Clausius also put forward the concept of entropy and Jo\u017eef Stefan introduced the law of radiant energy. According to Noether's theorem, the law of the conservation of energy is a result of the laws of physics not changing with time. Energy is expressed in one joule (J). The use of this unit is named in honor of the services of James Prescott Joule for his experiments on the mechanical equations of heat. In more basic terms 1 Joule is equal to 1 Newton-meter and, in terms of SI base units, 1 J is equal to 1 kg m2 s\u22122. In classical mechanics, energy is a useful property conceptually and mathematically. Several formulations of mechanics have been developed using energy as the main concept. Work, a form of energy, is force times distance. Here it is said that the work (W{\\displaystyle W}) is equal to the line integral of the force F along the path C; for more details see the mechanic work article. Work and energy are framework dependent.",

        "paragraph": "The total energy in a system is sometimes called the Hamiltonian, after William Rowan Hamilton. The classical equations of motion can be written in Hamiltonian form, even for very complex and abstract systems. These classical equations have their direct analogues in non-relativistic quantum mechanics. Another concept related to energy is called the Lagrangian, taken from the name of Joseph-Louis Lagrange. This formulation is as important as the Hamiltonian, and both can be used to derive or derive from the equations of motion. This concept is found in the context of classical mechanics, but is generally useful for modern physics. The Lagrangian concept is defined as kinetic energy minus potential energy. In general, the Lagrange concept is mathematically easier to use than the Hamiltonian for non-conservative systems (such as systems with frictional forces). In biology, energy plays a role at all levels of biological systems, from the biosphere down to the smallest living things. The biosphere is the part or layer of the earth where life exists. The scope of the biosphere ranges from the deepest root systems of trees on earth to the dark atmosphere of ecosystems in the deepest troughs of the oceans, deep forests and high mountain peaks. The movement of energy occurs in the biosphere. The energy that enters the biosphere comes from the sun. There are many types of energy emitted by the sun, but what the earth receives is a small fraction of that energy. The energy that comes from the sun that is commonly used by living things is heat and light energy. Heat energy is important for the earth to remain a biosphere as heat energy can maintain the earth's temperature to be optimal for life. Light is necessary for living things to see. In addition, light is also used by plants to make sugar and starch as nutrients for other living things.",

Basically, every activity carried out by living things requires energy. The process of synthesizing molecules, decomposing molecules, and moving molecules from one place to another also requires energy. Work is defined as the \"boundary integral\" of force F at distance s: The above equation says that work (W{\\displaystyle W}) is equal to the integral of the dot product between the force (F{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {F} }) acting on the body and the object's position approaches zero (s{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {s} }). Kinetic energy is the part of energy associated with the motion of an object. The equation above states that the kinetic energy (Ek{\\displaystyle E_{k}}) is equal to the dot product velocity (v{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {v} }) integral of an object and the object's momentum approaches zero (p{\\displaystyle \\ mathbf {p} }). In contrast to kinetic energy, which is the energy of a system due to its motion, or the internal motion of its particles, the potential energy of a system is the energy associated with the spatial configuration of its components and their interactions with one another. The number of particles exerting a force on each other automatically forms a system with potential energy. These forces, for example, can arise from electrostatic interactions (see Coulomb's law), or gravity. Internal energy is the kinetic energy associated with the motion of the molecules, and the potential energy associated with the rotational vibrations and electrical energy of the atoms within the molecule. Internal energy, like energy, is a state function that can be calculated in a system. Electrical energy is energy related to the calculation of electron currents expressed in Watt-hours or kiloWatt-hours. The transfer of electrical energy occurs in the form of a flow of electrons through a certain type of conductor.",

The total electric field energy plus the electromagnetic field energy equals the energy associated with the magnetic field arising from the flow of electrons through the induction coil. The form of change in mechanical energy is work. Mechanical energy is stored in the form of potential energy or kinetic energy. Electromagnetic energy is a form of energy related to electromagnetic radiation. Radiation energy is expressed in electron-Volt (eV) or mega electron-Volt (MeV) units. Electromagnetic radiation has nothing to do with mass and is a pure form of energy. If the wavelength is shorter and the frequency is higher, then the transmission energy is greater or more energetic. Sources of radiation or wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation are divided into several classes. Gamma (y) radiation is the most energetic type of radiation of electromagnetic energy. X-rays are produced by out of orbit electrons. Thermal radiation is electromagnetic radiation arising from atomic vibrations. This group of electromagnetic energy includes ultraviolet radiation or high temperature radiation, transparent radiation and low temperature radiation or infrared radiation. Other types of electromagnetic radiation are millimeter wave and microwave radiation used by radars and microwave-cookers. Chemical energy is the result of electron interactions between two or more atoms/molecules that experience mixing. These chemical reactions produce stable chemical compounds. Chemical energy can only occur in the form of stored energy. When energy is released in a reaction, the reaction is called an exothermic reaction. Units of chemical energy are expressed in kiloJoules, the British heat unit, or kiloCalorie. When the energy in a chemical reaction is absorbed, it is called an endothermic reaction. Exothermic chemical reactions are a very important fuel energy source for humans in combustion processes that involve the oxidation of fossil fuels.",

This energy is released as a result of the efforts of the particles to obtain a more stable state. The unit of nuclear energy is the million reaction electrons. Radioactive decay, fission and fusion occur during nuclear reactions. Thermal energy is a basic form of energy that can be fully converted to heat energy. The conversion of thermal energy into other energy is limited by the Second Law of Thermodynamics. The transition form of thermal energy can also be in the form of stored energy as latent heat or sensible heat in the form of enthalpy. Internal energy is the sum of all the microscopic energy elements present in the system. Internal energy is the energy required to create the system. Internal energy is related to potential energy, such as molecular structure, crystal structure, particle motion, and other aspects of geometry. Thermodynamics focuses on changes in internal energy, but not their absolute values. The first law of thermodynamics states that energy is always conserved and heat flow is a form of energy transfer. For a homogeneous system, with a predetermined temperature and pressure, the derivation formula from the first law, that system based solely on pressure and heat transfer forces (eg a full cylinder filled with gas), the differential change in energy in the system is formulated by the first term on the right is the heat transferred to the system, expressed in terms of temperature T and entropy S (entropy increases and dS changes positively when the system is heated), and the last term on the right is the work done on the system, where pressure P and volume V (sign negative comes from compression on the system which requires work to be done on the system so the change in volume, dV, is negative when work is done on the system).",

Energy transformation or energy conversion is the process of converting energy from one form of energy to another or different form of energy. The principle of transforming energy is utilized by humans into a system capable of producing business. Every energy transformation process must experience losses. Any loss in the energy transformation is affected by the environment. This is due to the nature of energy which tends to scatter everywhere. Planned energy conversion activities must have several general principles. The validity of the principle must be in the form of empirical evidence so that it can be used by energy end users. The main principles in energy transformation are energy saving, reducing energy losses and increasing energy efficiency which are managed through energy management. Energy transformation is carried out by paying attention to energy management without considering the conditions of technological diversity of energy users at the end of the energy cycle. The process of energy transformation can be done by using an energy conversion machine. Energy conversion can be in mechanical energy, electrical energy, chemical energy, nuclear energy and thermal energy. Energy management is always related to energy transformation. The general principles of energy management and energy transformation are the same. Each of them must use general principles and have a level of validity that can be demonstrated through empirical evidence.

Atomic diameters range from 62 picometers (Helium atoms) to 520 picometers (Cesium atoms), while combinations of several atoms form molecules with a nano-size range, that is, the size of objects that are: one billionth of a meter (0.0000000001 m) or one meter divided by one billion. The term Nanotechnology was first used in a scientific speech by Professor Nario Taniguci in 1974. The initial description of nanotechnology referred to the purpose of using technology to manipulate atoms and molecules to manufacture macro-scale products. A more general description is the manipulation of matter with a maximum size of 100 nanometers. Because of the wide range of potential applications (including industrial and military), governments of various countries have invested billions of dollars in nanotechnology research. Prior to 2012, the US invested US$3.7 billion using the National Nanotechnology Initiative, the European Union invested US$1.2 billion, and Japan invested US$750 million. More than sixty countries created nanotechnology research and development (R&D) programs between 2001 and 2004. In 2012, the US and EU each invested US$2.1 billion in nanotechnology research, followed by Japan with US$1.2 billion. Global investment totaled US$7.9 billion in 2012. Government funding was surpassed by corporate R&D spending on nanotechnology research, which totaled US$10 billion in 2012.

Video game consoles and personal computers are cheaper, faster and have higher memory thanks to nanotechnology. Nanotechnology makes existing medical equipment cheaper and easier to use. Cars are made with nanomaterials so they need less metal and are more fuel efficient in the future. Scientists are currently developing nanotechnology for diesel engines with cleaner exhaust gases. Platinum is currently used as a catalyst in diesel engines. The reduced catalyst will bind the nitrogen atoms of the NOx molecule thereby releasing oxygen. Then the catalyst oxidizes the hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide and water. Platinum is used in reduction and oxidation catalysts. However, using platinum is inefficient because it is expensive and non-renewable. The Danish company Innovationsfonden is investing DKK 15 million to find new catalysts for substitution with nanotechnology. The goal of this project was to maximize surface area and minimize material requirements. If the surface area of \u200b\u200bthe catalyst exposed to exhaust gas is greater, the catalyst efficiency increases. If successful, the use of platinum can be reduced by up to 25%.

The brachiopod valve is hinged at the rear, while the front can be opened for feeding or closed for protection. Two main groups are recognized, articulate and inarticulate. Articulate brachiopods have toothed hinges and simple opening and closing muscles, while inarticular brachiopods have toothless hinges and a more complex system of muscles used to keep the two halves aligned. In brachiopods, a stalk-like pedicle projects from an opening in one of the valves, known as the valve pedicle, anchoring the animal to the sea floor but free of silt that would block the opening. The word \"brachiopod\" is formed from the Ancient Greek words \u03b2\u03c1\u03b1\u03c7\u03af\u03c9\u03bd (\"arm\") and \u03c0\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2 (\"leg\"). They are often known as \"lantern shells\", because the curved shells of the class Terebratulida look a bit like pottery oil lamps. The life span ranges from three to more than thirty years. Mature gametes (ova or sperm) float from the gonads into the main coelom and then out into the mantle cavity. The inarticulate brachiopod larvae are miniature adults, with a lophophore that allows the larvae to forage and swim for months until the animals become heavy enough to live on the ocean floor. The planktonic larva of articulate species does not resemble the adult form, but instead looks like a blob with a yolk sac, and remains among the plankton for only a few days before leaving the water column at metamorphosis. In addition to the traditional classification of brachiopods into inarticulate and articulate, two approaches emerged in the 1990s: one approach classifies the inarticulate Craniids with the articulate brachiopods, because both use the same materials in the mineral layers of their shells; Another approach makes the Craniida a third group, as their outer organic layer differs from that in either of the other two.",

Traditionally, brachiopods have been considered a member, or as a sister group, of the Deuterostomes, a superphylum that includes chordates and echinoderms. One type of analysis of the evolutionary relationships of the brachiopods has always placed the brachiopods as protostomes while other types have been divided between placing the brachiopods between protostomes or deuterostomes. It was suggested in 2003 that brachiopods had evolved from a similar ancestor to Halkieria, a slug-like Cambrian animal with \"chain armor\" on its back and shells on the front and rear; he thinks that the ancestral brachiopod converted its shell into a pair of valves by folding the back of its body under its front. However, new fossils discovered in 2007 and 2008 suggest that the \"chain armor\" of the tommotiids formed the tubes of sessile animals; one tommotiid resembles a phoronid, i.e. a close relative or subgroup of brachiopods, while the other tommotiid bears two symmetrical plates which may be an early form of brachiopod valves. Lineages of brachiopods that have both fossil and extant taxa appear in the early Cambrian, Ordovician, and Carboniferous periods. Other lineages have appeared and then become extinct, sometimes during severe mass extinctions. At their peak in the Paleozoic era, brachiopods were the most abundant filtering and coral-building animals, and occupied other ecological niches, including the jet-propulsive swimming of clams. Brachiopod fossils have been useful indicators of climate change during the Paleozoic.

It is often thought that brachiopods declined after the Permian\u2013Triassic extinction and outcompeted bivalves, but a study in 1980 found brachiopod and shellfish species increased from the Paleozoic to modern times, with bivalves increasing more rapidly; after the Permian\u2013Triassic extinction event, brachiopods became for the first time less diverse than bivalves. Brachiopods live only in the sea, and most species avoid locations with strong currents or waves. The larvae of the articulate species settle quickly and form dense populations in well-defined areas whereas the larvae of the inarticulate species swim for up to one month and have a wide range. Brachiopods now live mainly in cold water and low light. Fish and crustaceans seem to find brachiopod meat distasteful and rarely attack them. Among the brachiopods, only lingulid (Lingula sp.) have been fished commercially, on a very small scale.

The pedicle valves are usually larger than the brachial valves. In most species of articulate brachiopods, both cusps are convex, the surfaces often showing growth tracks and/or other ornamentation. However, inarticulate lingulids, which burrow to the ocean floor, have valves that are smooth, flat and nearly the same size and shape. (R.C.Moore, 1952) Articulated (\"jointed\") brachiopods have teeth and socket arrangements by which the pedicle and brachial valves hinge, locking the valves against lateral displacement. Inarticulate brachiopods do not have matching teeth and sockets; their valves are held together only by muscles. (R.\u00a0C.\u00a0Moore, 1952) All brachiopods have adductor muscles that are fixed in the valve pedicle and which close the valve by pulling on the part of the brachial valve towards the hinge. These muscles have both \"fast\" fibers that close the valves in an emergency and \"capturing\" fibers that are slower but can keep the valves closed for a long time. Articulate brachiopods open the valves by means of an abductor muscle, also known as a diductor, which is located farther back and pulls on the brachial valve portion behind the hinge. Inarticulate brachiopods use a different opening mechanism, in which muscles reduce the length of the coelom (the main body cavity) and make it protrude outwards, pushing the valves apart.

The shells of indistinct brachiopods have the same layer order, but their composition is different from that of articulate brachiopods and also varies among classes of articulate brachiopods. The lingulid and discinid, which have a pedicle, have a matrix of glycosaminoglycans (long, unbranched polysaccharides), in which other materials are embedded: chitin in the periostracum; apatite containing calcium phosphate in the primary biomineralized layer; and a complex mixture in the deepest layer, which contains collagen and other proteins, chitinophosphate and apatite. Craniidae, which lack a pedicle and attach themselves directly to hard surfaces, have a chitin periostracum and a layer of the mineral calcite. Shells can grow holoperiferally, in which new material is added all over the edge, or mixoperipherally, in which new material is added to the posterior region of the shell in an anterior direction, growing toward the other shell. Brachiopods, like molluscs, have an epithelial mantle which secretes and lines the shell, and encloses the internal organs. The brachiopod body only occupies about one-third of the internal space inside the shell, closest to the hinge. The remainder of the space is lined with mantle lobes, extensions of which enclose the water-filled space where the lophophore is located. The coelom extends into each lobe as a network of canals, which carry nutrients to the edge of the mantle.

In some brachiopods a group of chaetae helps to funnel water in and out of the mantle cavity. In most brachiopods, diverticula (hollow extensions) from the mantle penetrate the valvular mineral layer to the periostraca. The function of these diverticula is uncertain and it has been suggested that they may be storage spaces for chemicals such as glycogen, may secrete repellents to prevent organisms from sticking to the shell or may aid in respiration. Experiments have shown that brachiopod oxygen consumption decreases when petroleum jelly is applied to the shell, plugging the diverticula. Like the bryozoans and phoronids, brachiopods have lophophores, crowns of tentacles in which cilia (fine hairs) create water currents that allow them to filter food particles from the water. However the bryozoan or phoronid lophophore is a ring of tentacles attached to a single retractable stalk, whereas the basic shape of the brachiopod lophophore is U-shaped, forming the brachia (\"arms\") from which the phylum is named. The brachiopod lophophore is non-retractable and occupies up to two-thirds of the internal space, in the very anterior region where the valve gapes when it is opened.

Food particles that collide with the tentacles are trapped by mucus, and cilia beneath the midsection drive this mixture to the base of the tentacles. A brachial groove surrounds the base of the tentacle, and the cilia themselves pass food along the groove to the mouth. The method used by brachiopods is known as \"upstream gathering\", as food particles are captured as they enter the ciliary field which creates a feeding current. This method is used by phoronids and bryozoans, and also by pterobranchia. Entoprocta use much the same crown of tentacles, but are dense and streamlined running from base to tip, forming a \"downstream gathering\" system that catches food particles as they are about to escape. Most modern species are attached to hard surfaces by a cylindrical pedicle (\"stalk\"), which is an extension of the body wall. The pedicle has a chitinous cuticle (\"skin\" non-cellular) and protrudes through an opening in the hinge. However, some genera such as the inarticulata Crania and articulate Lacazella do not have a pedicle, and attach the posterior pedicle of the valve to the surface so that the anterior portion rises slightly from the surface. In some articulate genera such as Neothyris and Anakinetica, the pedicle withers as it matures and eventually lies loose on the surface.

However, the pedicles of the order Discinida are short and attached to hard surfaces. An articular pedicle lacks a coelom, is constructed from different parts of the larval body, and has a core composed of connective tissue. Muscles on the back of the body can straighten, bend or even rotate the pedicle. The tips of the pedicles generally have root-like extensions or short papillae (\"bumps\"), which attach to a hard surface. However, articulate brachiopods of the genus Chlidonophora use a branched pedicle to anchor in sediments. The pedicle arises from the pedicle valve, either through a notch in the hinge or, in species where the pedicle valve is longer than the brachial valve, from an orifice where the double pedicle valve again touches the brachial valve. Some species stand with the front end up, while others lie horizontal with the pedicle valve at the top. The water flow enters the lophophore from the open side of the valve and exits at the front of the animal. In lingulid the entrance and exit of the canal are formed by groups of chaetae which function as funnels. In other brachiopods the inlet and outlet are regulated by lophophore shapes.

Brachiopods possess metanephridia, used by many phyla to excrete ammonia and other dissolved wastes. However, brachiopods lack podocytes, which perform the first stage of excretion in this process, and the metanephridia of brachiopods appear to be used only for excretion of sperm and ova. The majority of the food consumed by brachiopods is digestible, with very little solid waste produced. The cilia of the lophophore can change direction to expel isolated particles of undigested matter. If the animal encounters a large lump of unwanted material, the cilia lining the inlet stop and the tentacles in contact with the lump move apart to form a large gap and then slowly use their cilia to expel the lump into the mantle lining. The mantle layer has its own cilia, which clear any lumps out through the openings between the valves. If the lophophore is clogged, the adductor closes the valve sharply, which creates a \"sneeze\" that clears the obstruction. In some inarticulate brachiopods the alimentary canal is U-shaped and ends with an anus which removes solids from the front of the body wall. Other inarticulate brachiopods and all articulate brachiopods have curved intestines that terminate blindly, without an anus. These animals combine solid waste with mucus and periodically \"clean\" it, using sharp contractions of the intestinal muscles. The lophophore and mantle are the only surfaces that absorb oxygen and release carbon dioxide. Oxygen appears to be distributed by fluid from the coelom, which circulates through the mantle and is propelled either by contraction of the coelomic lining or by movement of the cilia.",

The maximum oxygen consumption of brachiopods is low, and their minimum requirements are immeasurable. Brachiopods also have colorless blood, circulated by a muscular heart which is on the dorsal side of the body above the abdomen. Blood passes through vessels that reach the front and back of the body, and gives off to organs including the lophophore in front and intestines, muscles, gonads and nephridia behind. The blood circulation does not appear to be completely closed off, and the coelomic fluid and blood do at least mix to some degree. The main function of the blood may be to carry nutrients. The \"brain\" of the adult articulate consists of two ganglia, one above and the other below the esophagus. Adult inarticulates have only the lower ganglion. From the ganglia and commissures where they join, nerves run to the lophophores, lobes of the mantle and the muscles that operate the valves. The mantle edge probably has the greatest concentration of sensors. Although not directly connected to sensory neurons, the mantle chaetae may send tactile signals to receptors in the mantle epidermis. Many brachiopods close their valves if a shadow appears above them, but the cells responsible for this are unknown. Some brachiopods have statocysts, which detect changes in their position. The life span ranges from 3 to over 30 years. Adults of most species are of one sex throughout their lives. Gonads are the developing masses of gametes (ovum or sperm), and most species have four gonads, two on each cusps. The gonads in the articulata are located in the ducts of the mantle lobes, whereas those in the inarticulates are near the gut. Mature gametes float into the main coelom and then exit into the mantle cavity via the metanephridia, which open on either side of the mouth.",

Cell division in the embryo is radial (cells form in stacked rings directly on top of one another), holoblastic (cells are separate, even though side by side) and regulative (the type of tissue in which cells develop is controlled by interactions between adjacent cells, rather than being rigid in each cell). While some animals develop a mouth and anus by deepening the blastopore, a \"dent\" in the surface of the early embryo, the blastopore of brachiopods closes, and their mouth and anus develop from the new opening. Inarticulate larvae swim as plankton for months and are like miniature adults, with valves, mantle lobes, a pedicle coiled up in the mantle cavity, and a small lophophore, which is used for feeding and swimming\u2014except that Craniidae lack a pedicle. As the shell becomes heavier, the juveniles sink to the bottom and become sessile adults. The larvae of articulate species live only on the yolk, and remain among the plankton for only a few days. This type of larva has a ciliated front lobe which forms the body and lophophore, a rear lobe which forms the pedicle, and a skirt-like mantle, with hem toward the rear. On metamorphosis to an adult, the pedicle attaches to a surface, the fore lobe develops the lophophore and other organs, and the mantle rolls over the fore lobe and begins secreting a shell. In cold seas, brachiopod growth is seasonal and their body weight often drops in winter. This variation in growth often forms a scallop growth line. Members of some genera have survived for a year in an aquarium without food. Fossil brachiopod genera have great diversity but few skeletal characteristics, whereas modern genera have much lower diversity but provide soft-bodied and skeletal characteristics\u2014and both sets of specimens have limitations that make it difficult to produce a comprehensive classification of brachiopods.",

However, other taxonomists believe that some characteristic patterns are stable enough to make the higher levels of classification worthwhile, although views differ on whether higher levels of classification should exist. A \"traditional\" classification was defined in 1869; two further approaches were established in the 1990s: About 330 living species are recognized, grouped into more than 100 genera. Most of the modern brachiopods are rhynchonelliformea \u200b\u200b(Articulata, but excluding Craniida). Brachiopods live only in the sea. Most species avoid locations with strong currents or waves, and typical sites include rocky overhangs, crevices and caves, steep slopes of continental shelves, and at the bottom of the deep ocean. However, some articulate species attach to sea grasses or in heavily sheltered sites in the intertidal zone. The smallest surviving brachiopod, Gwynia, is only about 1 mm long, and lives in gravel. Rhynchonelliformea \u200b\u200b(Articulata excluding Craniida), whose larvae consume only the yolk and settle and develop quickly, specialize in certain areas and form dense populations of up to thousands of individuals per meter.

Brachiopod shells occasionally show evidence of predator damage, and sometimes repair. Fish and crustaceans seem to find brachiopod meat distasteful. The fossil record shows that drilling predators such as gastropods attacked molluscs and sea urchins 10 to 20 times more often than brachiopods, suggesting that predators attacked brachiopods by mistake or when other prey was scarce. In waters where food is scarce, the snail Capulus ungaricus steals food from bivalves, slugs, tube worms and brachiopods. Among the brachiopods only lingulids have been fished commercially, and only on a very small scale. Brachiopods seldom settle on artificial surfaces, perhaps because they are susceptible to pollution.

The \"brachiopod fold\" hypothesis suggests that brachiopods evolved from a common ancestor like Halkieria, a slug-like animal with \"chain armor\" on its back and shells on its fore and hind limbs. This hypothesis proposes that the first brachiopods converted their shells into a pair of valves by folding the back of their body under the front. However, fossils from 2007 onward have supported new interpretations of the Early Cambrian tommotiids and the new hypothesis that brachiopods evolved from tommotiids. The tommotiid \"armor mail\" is well known but not in assembled form, and it is generally assumed that the tommotiid was a slug-like animal similar to the Halkieria, except that the tommotiid armor was made from organophosphatic compounds whereas the Halkieria's was made from calcite. But the fossils of a new tommotiid, Eccentrotheca, show assembled mantle armor that forms tubes, suggesting that the animal was sessile, rather than sluggish-like. Eccentrotheca's organophosphatic tube resembles that of the phoronids, sessile animals that feed by lophophores and are considered to be either close relatives or a sub-group of brachiopods. Paterimitra, another mostly assembled fossil discovered in 2008 and described in 2009, has two symmetrical plates on the underside, like brachiopod valves but does not completely enclose its body. At their peak in the Paleozoic era, brachiopods were the most abundant filter-building and coral-building animals, and occupied other ecological niches, including the jet-propulsive swimming of clams. However, after the Permian\u2013Triassic extinction event, informally known as the \"Great Dying\", brachiopods recovered only one third of their former diversity.

In 2007 Knoll and Bambach concluded that brachiopods were one of several groups most vulnerable to the Permian\u2013Triassic extinction, as all had calcareous bodies (made of calcium carbonate) and had low metabolic rates and weak respiratory systems. Brachiopod fossils are useful indicators of climate change during the Paleozoic era. When global temperatures are low, as in most of the Ordovician, the large differences in temperature between the equator and the poles create different collections of fossils at different latitudes. On the other hand, warm periods, such as the Silurian, create small differences in temperature, and all low to mid-latitude seas are colonized by the same few species of brachiopods. From about the 1940s to the 1990s, family trees based on embryological and morphological features placed brachiopods within or as a sister group to the Deuterostomia, the superphylum that includes chordates and echinoderms. Closer examination encountered difficulties at the base of brachiopods affiliated with deuterostomes: Nielsen suggested that the closely related brachiopods and phoronids were affiliated with the pterobranchial deuterostomes because their lophophores were pushed by one cilium per cell, whereas those of the bryozoans, which he considered protostomes, had several cilia per cell. .",

From 1988 onwards analyzes based on molecular phylogeny, which compare biochemical features such as similarities in DNA, have placed brachiopods within the Lophotrochozoa, a protostomes superphylum that includes mollusks, annelids and flatworms but excludes the protostomes Ecdysozoa, whose members include arthropods. This conclusion was unanimous among molecular phylogeny studies, which used a wide selection of genes: rDNA, Hox genes, mitochondrial protein genes, single nucleus protein genes and nuclear protein gene sets. Several combined studies in 2000 and 2001, using both molecular and morphological data, supported brachiopods as Lophotrochozoa, while others in 1998 and 2004 concluded that brachiopods were deuterostomes. Phoronids feed by lophophores, burrow or incise on the surface, and construct three-layer tubes made of polysaccharides, possibly chitin, mixed with the particles with materials from the seafloor. Traditionally they have been considered a separate phylum, but increasingly detailed molecular phylogeny studies between 1997 and 2000 have concluded that the phoronids are a subgroup of brachiopods. However, an analysis in 2005 concluded that the phoronids are a sub-group of bryozoa.

However, in 2008 two analyzes found that the closest relative of the brachiopod lophotrochozoa is the nemertea.

Hyperinflation usually occurs when there is an unknown increase in the money supply or a drastic change in the currency system. Hyperinflation is usually associated with war, economic depression, and the heating up of a country's political or social conditions.

When oxidized, neodymium reacts rapidly to give pink, purple or blue, and yellow compounds in oxidation states of +2, +3 and +4.

Neodymium is not found naturally in metallic form or is not alloyed with other lanthanides and is usually reworked for common metal uses. Although neodymium is classed as a rare earth element, it is still widely distributed in the Earth's crust and is not as rare as cobalt, nickel, or copper. Most of the world's commercial neodymium is mined in China. At first, neodymium compounds were first widely used as glass coloring in 1927. The color of neodymium compounds is due to the presence of Nd3+ ions which are generally reddish purple in color and can change depending on the type of lighting. This is due to the interaction of the sharp light absorption bands from neodymium with the surrounding light which is dominated by the emission bands of mercury, trivalent europium or terbium which look sharp. Some neodymium doped glass is used in the use of lasers which emit infrared with wavelengths between 1047 and 1062 nanometers.

Mechanics is a very important part of physics, especially for scientists and engineers. Mechanics also means the science that studies the force of motion of an object and the effects of the force it produces. Broadly speaking, the branch of mechanics is divided into two, namely statics and dynamics. While the dynamics can also be divided into two into kinematics and kinetics. Early thought about mechanics dates back to the time of Aristotle (384\u2013322 BC). The earliest field of mechanics was celestial mechanics. Aristotle in his time considered the Earth as a stationary object with the stars that revolve around it experiencing movement or rotation. Aristotle's thought was further developed by an astronomer named Tycho Brahe in the 16th century AD and further developed by his student named Johannes Kepler in the early 17th century AD. The laws of mechanics were only scientifically formulated in the early 17th century AD by Isaac Newton from empirical evidence found by Brahe and Kepler. The basic concepts put forward by Newton were force and mass, which were later developed again into the theory of gravity. The science of mechanics then continued to be developed in the second half of the 17th century AD to the first half of the 19th century AD. Its developers include Johann Bernoulli, Jean le Rond d'Alembert, Joseph-Louis de Lagrange and William Rowan Hamilton. At this time, mechanics was known as classical mechanics, theoretical mechanics or analytic mechanics.

Fluid mechanics also studies fluids that are not in a state of motion or rest. Much of what is discussed in fluid mechanics deals with continuum mechanics.

In its application, soil mechanics uses static techniques, dynamics techniques, fluid mechanics, and other technologies to analyze soil structure. Major studies in soil mechanics include the study of soil composition, strength, consolidation, and the use of hydraulic principles.

In the introduction to his book, he dedicated the book to three philosophers of the Pythagorean school, namely Brotinus, Leo, and Bathyllus. The difference between humans and animals according to Alkmeon is in the human ability to understand (understanding). Animals have the ability to feel (sensation). Likewise humans have this ability. However, humans have the ability to understand, while animals do not. According to Alkmeon, human health depended on the balance between the forces in the body. They are wet and dry, cold and hot, bitter and sweet, and so on. If one of these forces becomes dominant and dominates one of them, then that's where disease arises. In this theory, the influence of the Pythagorean school on the principle of balance is illustrated.

Cholesterol is a special type of lipid called a steroid, a lipid that has a chemical structure of four rings of carbon atoms. Other steroids include steroid hormones such as cortisol, estrogen, and testosterone; All of these steroid hormones are made from changes to the basic chemical structure of cholesterol. Besides being important for the structure of animal cells, cholesterol also serves as a precursor for the biosynthesis of steroid hormones, bile acids and vitamin D. Cholesterol is the main sterol synthesized by all animals. In vertebrates, liver cells usually produce the largest amounts. Prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea), do not produce cholesterol, although there are some exceptions, such as Mycoplasma, which require cholesterol for growth. Fran\u00e7ois Poulletier de la Salle first identified cholesterol in solid form in gallstones in 1769. It wasn't until 1815, however, that chemist Michel Eug\u00e8ne Chevreul named the compound \"cholesterin\". Cholesterol is required to build and maintain and modulate membrane fluidity over a range of physiological temperatures. The hydroxyl group of each cholesterol molecule interacts with the water molecules surrounding the membrane as well as the polar heads of the phospholipids and sphingolipids of the membrane, while the large steroid and hydrocarbon chains are embedded in the membrane, in addition to the nonpolar fatty acid chains of other lipids. Through interactions with the fatty acid chains of phospholipids, cholesterol enhances membrane packing, both of which alter membrane fluidity. All animal cells process cholesterol, whether for membrane structure or other uses, with relative rates of production that vary between cells and organ functions.

Followed by a second condensation between acetyl CoA and acetoacetyl-CoA to form 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarate CoA (MHG-CoA). This molecule is then reduced to mevalonate by the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase. The production of mevalonate is a rate determining and irreversible step in cholesterol synthesis and it is the capture point for the action of statin drugs (a class of cholesterol-lowering drugs). Mevalonate is eventually converted to isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) via two phosphorylation steps and one decarboxylation step which requires ATP. Three molecules of isopentenyl pyrophosphate condense to form farnesyl pyrophosphate via the action of geranyl transferase. Two molecules of farnesyl phosphatase then condense to form squalene with squalene synthase catalyst in the endoplasmic reticulum. Oxidosqualene cyclase then converts squalene into a ring form called lanosterol. Finally, lanosterol is converted to cholesterol through a 19-step reaction. The final step consists of NADPH and oxygen which aid in the oxidation of the methyl group to remove carbon, mutase to remove the alkene group, and NADH which helps reduce the ketone. Konrad Bloch and Feodor Lynen shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1964 for their discoveries of several mechanisms and methods of regulating cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism. Cholesterol biosynthesis is directly regulated by the level of cholesterol present, although the homeostatic mechanisms involved are only partially understood. Higher intake from food causes a net decrease in endogenous production, whereas lower intake from food has the opposite effect. The main regulatory mechanism is sensing of intracellular cholesterol in the endoplasmic reticulum by the SREBP proteins (sterol regulatory element-binding proteins 1 and 2).

While religion is difficult to define, a standard model of religion, used in lectures on religious studies, was proposed by Clifford Geertz, who simply calls it a \"cultural system\". A critique of the Geertz model by Talal Asad categorizes religion as \"an anthropological category.\" Many religions have mythologies, symbols, and sacred histories that purport to explain the meaning, purpose of life and the origins of life or the universe. From their beliefs about the cosmos and human nature, people derive morality, ethics, customary laws, or preferred lifestyles. According to some estimates, there are about 4,200 religions in the world. Many religions may have organized behavior, clergy, definitions of what constitutes obedience or membership, holy places, and holy books. Religious practices may also include rituals, sermons, commemoration or worship of gods, gods or goddesses, sacrifices, festivals, parties, trances, initiations, burial practices, weddings, meditation, prayer, music, art, dance, or any other aspect of human culture. . Religions may also contain mythology. The word religion is sometimes used interchangeably with faith, belief system, or sometimes set of duties. However, according to sociologist \u00c9mile Durkheim, religion differs from personal belief in that it is \"something socially real\". \u00c9mile Durkheim also said that religion is an integrated system consisting of beliefs and practices related to sacred things.

According to the Big Indonesian Dictionary, religion is a regulator (system) that regulates the system of faith (belief) and belief as well as devotion to the Almighty Creator and the rules relating to human relations and humans and their environment. The word \"religion\" comes from the Sanskrit word, \u0101gama (\u0906\u0917\u092e) which means \"Way of Life\". Another word to express this concept is religion which comes from the Latin religio and is rooted in the verb re-ligare which means \"to tie again\". That is, by being religious, a person binds himself to God. According to the philologist Max M\u00fcller, the root of the English word \"religion\", which is Latin religio, was originally used to mean simply \"fear of God or the gods, careful contemplation of divine things, piety\" (later later Cicero degrade to mean \"persistence\"). Max M\u00fcller characterizes many other cultures around the world, including Egyptian, Persian, and Indian, as sharing a common power structure at this point in history. What are the so-called ancient religions today, they will only be referred to as \"laws\". Many languages \u200b\u200bhave words that can be translated as \"religion\", but they may use them in very different ways, and some have no word to describe religion at all. For example, the Sanskrit word dharma, sometimes translated as \"religion\", also means law. Throughout classical South Asia, the study of law consisted of concepts such as penance through piety and practical rituals and traditions. Japan originally had a similar union between \"imperial law\" and universal or \"Buddhist law\", but this later became an independent source of power.",

For example God, Dewa, God, Syang-ti, Kami-Sama and others or just mentioning His attributes such as the Almighty, Ingkang Murbeng Dumadi, De Weldadige, and others. This belief leads humans to seek closeness to God by self-serving, that is, accepting all certainty that befalls themselves and those around them and believes that it comes from God; and comply with all statutes, rules, laws, and others that are believed to come from God.

Others reject distinction, suggesting that all religious practices, whatever their philosophical origins, are ethnic because they derive from a particular culture. In the 19th and 20th centuries, the academic practice of comparative religion divided religious beliefs into philosophically defined categories called \"world religions\". However, some scholars have recently argued that not all types of religion are necessarily separated by mutually exclusive philosophies, and further that the utility of ascribing practice to a particular philosophy, or even calling a particular religious practice, rather than cultural, political, or social in nature , limited. The current state of the psychological study of the nature of religiosity suggests that it is preferable to refer to religion as a largely invariant phenomenon that must be distinguished from cultural norms (i.e. \"religion\"). Some academics studying the subject have divided religion into three categories: Because religion remains recognized in Western thought as a universal impulse, many practitioners of religion aim to unite in interfaith dialogue, cooperation, and religious peace.

This dzimmah is a form of protection for the Jewish and Christian communities. There are no historical records of the mistreatment of Jews and Christians after the period of 1148 have a bad interpretation. In fact, many Jews and Muslims were forced to convert after the Islamic empire's rule ended in Cordoba by King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella and expelled Christian Jews, but because the authorities suspected that someone was pretending to convert, the new converts were required wear special clothes that distinguish them and can be watched in public places.

After his wanderings in Morocco, he lived briefly in the Holy Land (Jerusalem), and then settled in Fusthat, Egypt. where he was doctor of the Grand Vizier Alfadhil and also possibly the doctor of Sultan Saladin of Egypt. In his last residence, he composed most of his oeuvre, including the Mishneh Torah. He died in Fusthat, and was buried in Tiberias (now in Israel). His son, Avraham, who is recognized as a great scholar, succeeded Maimonides as Nagid (head of the Egyptian Jewish community). He also took on his father's role as palace doctor, at the young age of 18. He greatly honored the memory of his father, and throughout his career defended his father's writings against all critics. The office of Nagid was held by the Maimonides family for four successive generations until the end of the 14th century. Maimonides is highly revered in Spain and a statue of him was erected in C\u00f3rdoba next to his synagogue, which no longer serves as a place of Jewish worship, but is open to the public. Today in C\u00f3rdoba there is no longer a Jewish community, but the city is proud of its historical links with Maimonides. At the time, many Jews believed that the bodily resurrection was synonymous with the world to come. Hence the denial of a permanent and universal resurrection is considered the same as a denial of the words of the Talmudic sages. However, instead of denying the resurrection, or defending the prevailing dogma of the time, Maimonides proposes a third way: That the resurrection has nothing to do with the messianic era (in this world) nor with Olam Haba (fully spiritual life after death).",

Maimonides remains the most widely debated and controversial Jewish thinker among modern scholars. He has been made an intellectual symbol and hero by almost all major movements in modern Judaism, and has proved vital to philosophers such as Leo Strauss. Maimonides' importance to various systems of thought lies in the philosopher's acceptance of paradoxical and often contradictory ideas. Maimonides' ability to reconcile philosophical thought with the traditional has made his legacy very diverse and dynamic. There are modern thinkers who believe that Maimonides was in fact a secret Aristotelian who understood Jewish tradition as an allegorical system meant to defend the Jewish community, but which was philosophically inaccurate. This belief clashed with his numerous writings on religion and halakha, his personal communications with various persons and communities. Maimonides' personality is thought to reflect perceptions of religious liberalism because of the controversies that arose around some of his works 800 years ago, and his rationalistic approach to understanding certain \"hagaddah\" literature. Additionally, in his legal work, the Mishne Torah, Maimonides advances the view held by some, including some Geonim, that the medical drugs in the Talmud may be inaccurate, because the Talmudic rabbis worked with the scientific knowledge they had at the time, and is not part of the tradition received from other wise men.",

Pringgodigdo, a fax machine is a wireless transmission system for pictures and graphics by adjusting the light rays and photoelectric cells and changing the dark and light parts of a material so that it can be emitted in sound, then the receiving machine will change it back to the original to scientifically treated paper. Apart from sending documents, the fax machine is also capable of sending photo images with half tone facilities. Fax machines usually consist of a modem, a copier, an image scanner, and a data printer (printer). The working process of the fax machine begins with the requirement that the recipient and sender must have a fax machine. The sender will enter the document to be sent to the feeder section of the fax machine and then dial the telephone number of the destination fax machine. When a connection has been established with the destination fax machine, the fax machine will scan by reading a very small area of \u200b\u200bthe document.

There are several different indicators in measuring the ability of a fax machine, namely by group (group), class (class), data transmission rate (data transmission rate), and compliance with ITU-T recommendations. Fax machines usually use a standard PSTN connection and a telephone number. The main reason for the success of fax machines is that every country in the world uses the same standard, namely group 3. Experts believe that group 3 has the potential to continue to experience progress and improvement in the future. Group 4 machines, which run four times as fast, are available but can only work on exchange systems in digital telephones.

Scientists often use the term fungus as a synonym for Fungi. The common people refer to most members of the fungi as mushrooms, molds, yeasts, or yeasts, although it is often the external appearance that is visible, not the species itself. The difficulty in recognizing fungi is more or less due to the alternation of offspring that have completely different appearances (remember metamorphosis in insects or frogs). Fungi reproduce both sexually and asexually. Sexual propagation is by means of: two hyphae from different fungi fuse and form a zygote, then the zygote grows into a fruiting body, while asexual propagation is by forming spores, budding or fragmentation of hyphae. Fungi have a spore box called a sporangium. Inside the sporangium are spores. An example of a fungus that forms spores is Rhizopus. An example of a fungus that forms buds is Saccharomyces. Fungal hyphae can collapse and individual fragments can grow into fruiting bodies. The study of fungi is called mycology (from the Greek roots \u03bc\u03c5\u03ba\u03b5\u03c2, \"mucus\", and \u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03bf\u03c3, \"knowledge\", \"symbol\").

To overcome this limitation, some fungi, such as Armillaria, form rhizomorphs, which resemble and perform functions similar to plant roots. As eukaryotes, fungi possess biosynthetic pathways for producing terpenes that use mevalonic acid and pyrophosphate as chemical building blocks.

This organism spends part of its life cycle as a motile zoospore, enabling it to propel itself through water and enter an amphibian host. Another example of aquatic fungi are those that live in the hydrothermal areas of the sea.

In mycology, species have historically been distinguished by various methods and concepts. Classification based on morphological characteristics, such as spore size and shape or fruit structure, has traditionally dominated the taxonomy of fungi. Species can also be distinguished by their biochemical and physiological characteristics, such as their ability to metabolize certain chemical substances, or their reactions to chemical tests. The biological species concept distinguishes species based on their ability to mate. The application of molecular tools, such as DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, to study fungal diversity has greatly increased the resolution and added strength to estimates of genetic diversity within various taxonomic groups.

Although fungal spores were first observed by Giambattista della Porta in 1588, work considered a pioneer in the development of mycology was the publication Nova plantarum genera in 1729 by Pier Antonio Micheli. Micheli not only observed spores but also demonstrated that, under the right conditions, spores can be induced to grow into the same species of fungus as the species from which they originated. Expanding on the use of the binomial nomenclature system introduced by Carolus Linnaeus in his Species plantarum (1753), the Dutchman Christian Hendrik Persoon (1761-1836) established the first classification of fungi so skillfully that he is considered the founder of modern mycology. Later, Elias Magnus Fries (1794\u20131878) further elaborated on the classification of fungi, using color and the microscopic characteristics of spores, methods still used by taxonomists today.

Most fungi grow as hyphae, cylindrical, thread-like structures 2\u201310 \u00b5m in diameter and up to several centimeters long. Hyphae grow at the tip (apex); New hyphae are usually formed by the appearance of new ends along existing hyphae by a process called branching, or sometimes the growing hyphae tips branch in half, giving rise to two parallel growing hyphae. Hyphae also sometimes fuse when they touch, a process called hyphal fusion (or anastomosis). This growth process leads to the development of the mycelium, a network of interconnected hyphae. Hyphae may be septate or senocytic. Septate hyphae are divided into chambers separated by cross walls (internal cell walls, called septa, which form perpendicular to the cell walls that give the hypha its shape), with each chamber containing one or more nuclei; senocytic hyphae are not divided into chambers. Septa have pores that allow cytoplasm, organelles, and sometimes nuclei to pass through; an example is the septum dolipore in fungi from the phylum Basidiomycota. Senositic hyphae are essentially multinucleate supercells. Many species have developed specialized hyphal structures for nutrient uptake from living hosts; for example haustoria in plant-parasitic species of most fungal phyla, and arbuscules of some mycorrhizal fungi, which penetrate into host cells to consume nutrients.

Each fungus belongs to the same category which is differentiated by the type of spore, the morphology of the hyphae and the sexual cycle. Fungal mycelia can be seen with the naked eye, for example, on various surfaces and substrates, such as damp walls and rotting food, commonly called mold. Mycelia grown on solid agar media in laboratory petri dishes are usually referred to as colonies. These colonies may exhibit growth patterns and colors (due to spores or pigmentation) that can be used as diagnostic features in species or group identification. Some individual fungal colonies can reach extraordinary dimensions and ages as in the case of the Armillaria solidipes colony, which spans an area of \u200b\u200bover 900 ha (3.5 square miles), with an estimated age of nearly 9,000 years. The apotechium\u2014a specialized structure important in sexual reproduction in the Ascomycota\u2014is a cup-shaped fruiting body that is often macroscopic in size and carries a hymenium, a layer of tissue containing spore-bearing cells. The fruit bodies of Basidiomycota (basidiokarp) and some Ascomycota can sometimes grow very large, and many are known as mushrooms (mushroom). Macroscopic mushrooms are also very useful for humans because several types of mushrooms have been proven to be used as food ingredients and medicines for various diseases. Fungal growth as hyphae on or in solid substrates or as single cells in aquatic environments is adapted to extract nutrients efficiently, because this growth form has a high surface area to volume ratio. Hyphae are especially adapted for growth on solid surfaces, and for invading substrates and tissues.",

        "paragraph": "Hyphae can exert great mechanical force for penetration; for example, many plant pathogens, including Magnaporthe grisea, form structures called apresorium which evolved into skewers in plant tissue. The pressure exerted by the appressorium, which is directed at the plant epidermis, can exceed 8 megapascals (1,200 psi). The filamentous fungus Paecilomyces lilacinus uses the same structure to penetrate nematode eggs. The mechanical stress exerted by the appressorium results from physiological processes that increase intracellular turgor by producing osmolytes such as glycerol. Such adaptations are complemented by hydrolytic enzymes secreted into the environment to digest large organic molecules\u2014such as polysaccharides, proteins, and lipids\u2014into smaller molecules that can then be absorbed as nutrients. Most filamentous fungi grow polarly (extending in one direction) by extending at the apex of the hyphae. Other forms of fungal growth include intercalary extension (longitudinal expansion of the hyphal compartment below the apex) as in the case of some endophytic fungi, or growth by volume expansion during the development of fungal stypes and other large organs. Growth of fungi as multicellular structures composed of somatic and reproductive cells\u2014a feature that develops independently in animals and plants\u2014serves several functions, including the development of fruiting bodies for sexual spore dispersal (see above) and biofilms for substrate colonization and cell-to-cell communication. Fungi have traditionally been considered as heterotrophs, organisms that rely solely on carbon fixed by other organisms for metabolism. Fungi have evolved a high degree of metabolic flexibility that allows them to use a variety of organic substrates for growth, including simple compounds such as nitrate, ammonia, acetate, or ethanol. In some species, the pigment melanin may play a role in extracting energy from ionizing radiation, such as gamma radiation.",

        "paragraph": "This \"radiotrophic\" form of growth has been described for only a few species, its effect on the growth rate of small fungi, and the underlying biophysical and biochemical processes is not well understood. This process may be similar to CO2 fixation using visible light, but using ionizing radiation as an energy source. The reproduction of fungi is extremely complex, reflecting the differences in lifestyles and genetic makeup within this diverse kingdom of organisms. It is estimated that one-third of all fungi reproduce using more than one propagation method; for example, reproduction may occur in two well-differentiated stages in the life cycle of a species, teleomorph and anamorph. Environmental conditions trigger genetically determined developmental states that lead to the formation of specialized structures for sexual or asexual reproduction. These structures aid reproduction by efficiently dispersing spores or spore-bearing propagules. Asexual reproduction occurs via vegetative spores (conidia) or through fragmentation of the mycelium. Mycelial fragmentation occurs when the fungal mycelium separates into several pieces, and each part grows into a separate mycelium. Mycelial fragmentation and vegetative spores maintain niche-adapted clone populations, and allow for more rapid dispersal than sexual reproduction. \"Fungi imperfecti\" (fungi lacking a perfect or sexual stage) or Deuteromycota comprises all species that lack an observable sexual cycle. Deuteromycota is not an accepted taxonomic clade, and is now considered to mean only fungi that have no known sexual stage. Sexual reproduction by meiosis has been directly observed in all fungal phyla except Glomeromycota (genetic analysis suggests meiosis may also occur in Glomeromycota). It differs in many aspects from sexual reproduction in animals or plants. Differences also exist between groups of fungi and can be used to distinguish species with morphological differences in sexual structure and reproductive strategies.",

        "paragraph": "Mating experiments between fungal isolates can identify species based on the concept of biological species. The main fungal groups were initially described on the basis of their sexual spore and structural morphology; for example, structures containing the spores, ascus and basidium, can be used in the identification of Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, respectively. Fungi use two mating systems: heterothallic species allow mating only between individuals of opposite mating types, whereas homothallic species can mate, and reproduce sexually, with other individuals or themselves. Most fungi have haploid and diploid stages in their life cycle. In sexually reproducing fungi, suitable individuals may join by joining their hyphae together into interconnected tissues; this process, anastomosis, is necessary for the initiation of the sexual cycle. Many Ascomycota and Basidiomycota go through a dikaryotic stage, in which nuclei inherited from the two parents do not merge immediately after cell fusion, but remain separate within the hyphal cells (see heterokaryosis). In Ascomycota, the dikaryotic hyphae of the hymenium (spore-bearing tissue layer) form a characteristic hook on the hyphal septum. During cell division, hook formation ensures proper distribution of the newly dividing nuclei to the apical and basal hyphal compartments. Ascus is then formed, where karyogamy (nuclear fusion) occurs. The ascus is embedded in the ascocarp, or fruiting body. Karyogamy within the ascus is soon followed by meiosis and production of ascospores. After dispersal, the ascospores can germinate and form a new haploid mycelium. Sexual reproduction in Basidiomycota is similar to Ascomycota. Matched haploid hyphae coalesce to produce a dikaryotic mycelium. However, the dikaryotic phase is more abundant in Basidiomycota, often also present in vegetatively growing mycelium. Special anatomical structures, called clamp connections, are formed at each hyphal septum.",
        "language": "indonesian"

    {
        "paragraph": "As with the structurally similar hooks in the Ascomycota, the clamp connections in the Basidiomycota are necessary for controlled nuclear transfer during cell division, to maintain the dikaryotic stage with two genetically distinct nuclei in each hyphal compartment. A basidiocarp is formed within which there are club-like structures known as basidia which produce haploid basidiospores after karyogamy and meiosis. The best known basidiocarps are fungi, but basidiocarps can take other forms (see Morphology section). In fungi formerly classified as Zygomycota, the haploid hyphae of two individuals fuse, forming the gametangium, a specialized cell structure that becomes the fertile gamete-producing cell. Gametangia develop into zygospores, thick-walled spores formed by the union of gametes. When the zygospore germinates, it undergoes meiosis, producing new haploid hyphae, which can then form asexual sporangiospores. These sporangiospores allow the fungus to spread rapidly and germinate into new, genetically identical, haploid fungal mycelia. Both asexual and sexual spores or sporangiospores are often actively dispersed by forced ejection of their reproductive structures. This ejection ensures the exit of the spores from the reproductive structures as well as long distance travel by air. Special mechanical and physiological mechanisms, as well as spore surface structures (such as hydrophobin), allow efficient spore ejection. For example, the spore-bearing cells of some Ascomycota species have structures that cause the accumulation of substances that affect cell volume and fluid balance, allowing the explosive release of spores into the air. The forced ejection of a single spore called a ballistospore involves the formation of a drop of water (Buller's drop), which when touching the spore causes the release of a projectile with an initial acceleration of over 10,000 g; the end result is that the spores are expelled 0.01-0.02\u00a0cm, a distance sufficient to fall through the gills or pores into the air below.",

    {
        "paragraph": "Other fungi, such as puffball, rely on alternative mechanisms to release spores, such as external mechanical forces. Bird's nest mushrooms use the force of falling water droplets to release spores from cup-shaped fruiting bodies. Another strategy exists in stinkhorns, fungi with bright colors and a foul odor that attract insects to spread their spores. The most common mode of spore dispersal is by wind\u2013species that use this form of dispersion often produce dry or hydrophobic spores that do not absorb water and are easily dispersed by raindrops, for example. Most of the studied fungal species produce spores that are carried by the wind. In addition to normal sexual reproduction by meiosis, certain fungi, such as those in the genera Penicillium and Aspergillus, can exchange genetic material by a parasexual process, initiated by anastomoses between hyphae and plasmogamy of fungal cells. The frequency and relative importance of parasexual occurrences is unclear and may be lower than that of other sexual processes. Parasexual processes are known to play a role in intraspecific hybridization and may be necessary for interspecies hybridization, which has been linked to major events in the evolution of fungi. In contrast to plants and animals, the fossil record of early fungi is scanty. Factors that likely contributed to the underrepresentation of fungal species among fossils include the nature of the fruiting bodies of fungi, which are soft and biodegradable tissues and the microscopic dimensions of most fungal structures, which are therefore not easy to prove. Fossil fungi are difficult to distinguish from other microbes, and are easiest to identify when they resemble living fungi. Fungal samples are often obtained from permineralized plant or animal hosts and are usually studied by making thin preparations that can be examined with a light or transmission electron microscope.",

        "paragraph": "Researchers study compressed fossils by dissolving the surrounding matrix in acid and then using light or a scanning electron microscope to examine surface details. The earliest fossils bearing the hallmarks of fungi are from the Paleoproterozoic era, about 2,400 million years ago (mya); These multicellular benthic organisms have filamentous structures capable of anastomoses. Another study (2009) estimated the emergence of fungi at around 760-1,060 mya based on comparisons of evolution rates in closely related groups. During most of the Paleozoic Era (542\u2013251 mya), fungi appear to have been aquatic and consisted of organisms similar to the surviving Chytridiomycota in that they have flagellated spores. Evolutionary adaptation from an aquatic to a terrestrial lifestyle requires a diversification of ecological strategies for obtaining nutrition, including parasitism, saprobism, and the development of mutualistic relationships such as mycorrhiza and lichenization. A study in 2009 showed that the ancestral ecological state of the Ascomycota was saprobism, and that independent lichenization events had occurred several times. Fungi in classical taxonomy in ordinary schools are grouped as divisio into five classes: The division above has been considered obsolete because recent findings have made fungi elevated to a separate Kingdom of organisms (Regnum), with a separate division/phylum: Phylum Blastocladiomycota Phylum Chytridiomycota Phylum Glomeromycota Phylum Microsporidia Phylum Neocallimastigomycota Subregnum : Dikarya (term. Deuteromycota), includes Phylum Ascomycota Phylum Basidiomycota Sub-phylum incertae sedis (including Dikarya whose phylum has not yet been determined) Deuteromycota is a group for fungi that cannot yet be classified in the four phyla above (status \"unclear\", incertae sedis) . Lichens or Lichens are not individuals, but a form of close mutualism symbiosis between fungi and algae. However, special names are often given because of their practical importance in applications, such as pharmaceuticals.

        "paragraph": "Along with bacteria, fungi are the main decomposers in most terrestrial (and some aquatic) ecosystems, and therefore play an important role in biogeochemical cycles and in many food webs. As decomposers, fungi play an important role in nutrient cycling, especially as saprotrophs and symbionts, decomposing organic matter into inorganic molecules, which can then re-enter the anabolic metabolic pathways in plants or other organisms. Many fungi have important symbiotic relationships with organisms from most if not all of the Kingdom. This interaction can be protagonist or antagonistic, or in the case of commensal functions, it is neither beneficial nor detrimental to the host. The mycorrhizal symbiosis between plants and fungi is one of the best known plant-fungal associations and is essential for plant growth and survival in many ecosystems; more than 90% of all plant species engage in mycorrhizal relationships with fungi and depend on these relationships for reproduction. Mycorrhizal symbiosis dates back at least 400 million years. Mycorrhiza enhances plant uptake of inorganic compounds, such as nitrate and phosphate, from soils that have low concentrations of these key plant nutrients. Fungi can also mediate the transfer of carbohydrates and other nutrients from plant to plant. Such mycorrhizal communities are called \"common mycorrhizal networks\". A special case of mycorrhiza is myco-heterotrophy, in which a plant parasitizes a fungus, obtaining all of its nutrients from the fungal symbiont. Some species of fungi inhabit the tissues in roots, stems and leaves, in which case they are called endophytes. Similar to mycorrhizae, endophytic colonization by fungi can benefit both symbionts; for example, grass endophytes provide their hosts with increased resistance to herbivory and other environmental pressures and receive food and protection from plants in return.",

This scientific branch aims to reveal about the life of an organism and what influences it. Biogeography includes the analysis and explanation of distribution patterns combined with an understanding of changes in the distribution of living things from the past to the present. The main study in biogeography discusses the historical development of groups of organisms. The observed developments relate to the origin, spread, and the relationship between the present distribution in explaining past history. The focus of the discussion of biogeography lies in the interaction of organisms with the physical environment and interactions between organisms. Biogeography also studies the relationships that influence the species and taxa found today. Biogeography is divided into regions and sub-regions with reference to the degree of human intervention. Markers for biogeographical regions and sub-regions are sign systems that use letter symbols and a decimal system. This marker serves to describe an ecosystem with a concise and globally understood formula. Science doesn't just ask What species? and Where?, but he also asks Why? and sometimes Why not?. In biogeography, historical approaches and ecological factors are used to study the distribution of flora and fauna in the world. The historical approach views biogeography from the aspects of the development and evolution of organisms, which are influenced by climate, migration, past developments on the earth's surface, and its relationship with the present environment. The ecological point of view views biogeography from the point of view of the relationship between the organism itself and the environment and its influences. The pattern of distribution of species at this level can be explained by a combination of hereditary factors such as speci\ufb01cation, extinction, continental drift, glaciation (which is also related to sea level, river channels and related matters), as well as river capture and availability of natural resources.",

        "paragraph": "The branch of biogeography that studies the distribution and distribution of plants is called Phytogeography. Meanwhile, Zoogeography studies the distribution of animals. The term biogeography was introduced by biologists, namely Robert H. MacArthur and E.O. Wilson in the 1960s, which is a field of science that contains biological evolution, namely discussions about biology, ecology, genetics, geography, and paleontology, which are used to determine the division of species. Biogeography was developed and popularized by early naturalists such as Carl von Linne, Alexander von Humbolt, Edward Forbes, Joseph Hooker, Louis Agassiz, Alfred R. Wallace, and Charles Darwin, who originally classified different aspects of plants. Molecular biologists define biogeography as the study of gene lineage, while ecologists consider biogeography to be the study of ecosystems and geographic distribution. Biogeography is also known as learning related to the biosphere, which contains the physical nature around it, both soil, animals and plants. Biogeographic regions are shaped by the presence of climate. The types of organisms that live in an area are determined by one of the climatic elements, namely humidity. Moisture levels are determined by sunlight and soil temperature in an environment. Plant development and biodiversity are determined by rainfall. Heavy rainfall supports the growth of large trees. On the other hand, little rainfall favors the development of short trees, shrubs, grasses, and desert plants. Rainfall and soil temperature in an area are directly proportional to the number of plants that can develop in an area. Climatic conditions greatly affect the state of plants, while the state of vegetation affects the existence of certain types of animals. The state of the fauna in each area (biome) largely depends on the possibilities that area can provide for providing food.",

        "paragraph": "Directly or indirectly, climate also influences the distribution of fauna. Due to the influence of climate, the distribution of fauna also follows the distribution of flora. The differences in the biogeographical regions of the earth are due to the changing geological and climatic history of the earth. In the span of millions of years, the distribution and location of land and sea have always experienced shifts and movements. The plates of the earth's crust are always moving and colliding frequently, so that the location and height of the land and seas on this earth are always changing. Because the surface and height of land and sea are always changing, the climate is also changing. The main factor causing the spread of fauna in the world is population pressure, resulting in intense competition that forces animals to migrate to survive. Another factor is the new habitat that forces animals or plants to adapt to the new environment. The distribution of flora and fauna is strongly influenced by the media, so they can develop and spread. This medium can be wind, air, or water. For example, old kapok pods will fly with the help of the wind to carry the seeds to another place. Coconuts will be carried by water or ocean currents to other relatively new places. In addition, humans are also the main medium in the distribution of flora and fauna. For example, the quinine plant, which is not native to Indonesia, was developed by the colonialists in Indonesia and turned out to be suitable. Distribution barriers in general include climatic, soil, topographical and biological barriers. Climate barriers are related to the adaptability of living things to air temperature, air humidity, and rainfall. Soil resistance is related to soil fertility, hydrology, and soil aeration. Certain landscape patterns can become a barrier to the spread of flora and fauna. Biological barriers related to the availability of food and competition between living things.",

        "paragraph": "The distribution of plants is influenced by the location of the topography, namely the height above sea level, other factors, namely the type of soil, water availability, climate, weather, type of rain, human activities, and so on. The distribution of plants in the world can be divided into several distribution areas as follows: The diversity of animals occurs due to factors of natural conditions, obstacles encountered in nature and the movement of animals in the wild. The distribution of animals in the world is divided into several distribution areas, namely: The uniqueness and high biodiversity are inseparable from climatic backgrounds, geological history, biogeographical units, speciation processes, shape (as well as number and size) of islands, number of ecosystems and so on. Biodiversity is not evenly distributed on earth, the tropics have richer biodiversity, and the amount of biodiversity continues to decrease the farther from the equator. Diversity also varies with the altitude level of an area and seasonal classification. At altitudes above 2000 m, biodiversity decreases. Likewise in the classification of seasons, tropical rain forests are generally located in areas with high rainfall and relatively constant temperatures. The existence of biodiversity and distribution patterns are the result of evolutionary processes over billions of years. The geographic distribution of species (biogeography) was what first gave Darwin the idea of \u200b\u200bevolution. The islands contain many plant and animal species that are native and not found elsewhere, but are closely related to the nearest mainland species or on the surrounding islands. Two islands with very similar environments in different parts of the world are inhabited not by very closely related species, but by species taxonomically related to the plants and animals of nearby landmass whose environments are often very different.",

        "paragraph": "Australia is home to many marsupial mammals (Marsupials) but relatively few placental animals (eutheria). The prevailing hypothesis is that the unique fauna evolved on the Australian continent in isolation from places where the placental ancestors of mammals lived. Although such biogeographical patterns are inappropriate if one imagines that species were placed individually in suitable environments, they do make sense in the context of evolutionary history. Existing biogeographical patterns result from processes, such as the creation of new species, diversification, extinction, and dispersal, which occur in a constantly changing environment. The formation of new species and subspecies is driven by changes in the gene pool that occur due to mutations, genetic drift, gene flow, and natural selection. Some species produce geographic variations with certain characteristics to adapt to their local environment. Geographical barriers (geological processes) that physically separate a population into two or more populations that are isolated from each other so that new species are formed, this event is called allopatric speciation. Allopatric populations are formed from this speciation. Geographical isolation is a natural boundary that cannot be crossed, so one population will never meet another population, so natural marriage cannot occur. How strong the geographic barrier is needed to keep allopatric populations apart depends on the ability of the organisms to spread. If a population becomes allopatric, the possibility of speciation is very high, especially in small isolated populations. Allopatric speciation has been common in island chain areas, where organisms that dispersed passively from their parent population have formed new populations that thrive in isolation. Speciation occurs in populations that are on the edge of the range of species that become isolated and differentiate to form new species.",

        "paragraph": "An example is the Tanysiptera bird in New Guinea, which comprises the main species T. galatea galatea that lives on the main island. Meanwhile, the coastal areas and surrounding islands are inhabited by morphologically different racial groups. Parapatric speciation is the result of the different evolution of two populations that live next to each other geographically. Differences occur due to local adaptations that form a genetic gradient. An example is the light-bellied mouse species Mus musculus in eastern Europe which is separated by a hybridization zone from the dark-bellied Mus domesticus in western Europe. A new species may form in the same geographical area as the parent species. Genetic isolation develops within populations, in the absence of geographic isolation. Species diversification involves the early separation of new species caused by adaptive ecological and radiation factors. Species that are in the same niche have non-overlapping geographic distributions, whereas species that live together in the same area and habitat tend to use very different resources. Adaptive radiation is the diversification of species to fill various ecological niches. Darwin's finches in the Galapagos Islands are a well-known example of adaptive radiation. The Hawaiian silversword Alliance has been cited as a remarkable example of adaptive radiation in plants, with a common ancestor that split from California tarweeds about 13-15 million years ago and arrived in Hawaii about 4-6 million years ago. This plant has produced various types of plants that spread in almost all environmental conditions in Hawaii, with an altitude range of 75 - 3,750 m. The lemurs of Madagascar are the result of primate adaptive radiation, with 33 species in 14 genera living today.",

Archaea are classified as prokaryotes, a group of microbes that lack a cell nucleus and membrane-bound organelles. Originally, archaea were classified as bacteria and given the name archaebacteria (in the kingdom Archaebacteria), but this classification is no longer used. Archaic cells have unique properties that separate archaea from the other two domains of life, namely Bacteria and Eukaryota. Archaea are further divided into several phyla. Classification is difficult because the majority of archaea have not been isolated in the laboratory and their gene sequences have only been detected from samples taken from the environment. Archaea and bacteria are generally similar in size and shape, although some archaea have very odd shapes, for example the flat, square cells like Haloquadratum walsbyi. Despite the morphological similarities between archaea and bacteria, archaea share genes and several metabolic pathways that are more similar to those of eukaryotes, especially the enzymes involved in transcription and translation. One unique aspect of archaea biochemistry is the dependence of archaea on the ether lipids in their cell membranes. Archaea use more energy sources than eukaryotes, which range from organic compounds such as sugars, ammonia, metal ions, or even hydrogen gas. The salt-tolerant archaea (Haloarchaea) use sunlight as an energy source, while other archaea species fix carbon; however, unlike plants and cyanobacteria, no archaea do both ways. Archaea reproduce asexually by binary fission, fragmentation, or budding. Unlike bacteria and eukaryotes, no archaea species are known to form endospores. The first archaea observed were extremophiles living in extreme environments, such as hot springs and salt lakes, with no other organisms.",

They are abundant in the oceans, and archaea in the form of plankton are probably one of the most abundant groups of organisms on the planet. Archaea played a major role in life on Earth. They are part of the microbiota for all organisms. As the human microbiota, archaea play an important role in the large intestine, oral cavity and skin. Their morphological, metabolic and geographical diversity allows them to have a wide range of ecological roles, for example in carbon fixation in the carbon cycle, roles in the nitrogen cycle, cycling of organic compounds, and maintaining symbiotic communities and microbial syntrophy. There are no clear examples of archaea that are pathogenic or parasitic. In contrast, archaea are often mutualists or commensals, for example the methanogens that live in the digestive tracts of humans and ruminants, where they live in large numbers and aid digestion. Methanogens are used in biogas production and sewage treatment. Meanwhile, enzymes from extremophile archaea which can withstand high temperatures and organic solvents are utilized in biotechnology. For most of the 20th century, prokaryotes were considered as a single group of organisms and classified based on their biochemical, morphological, and metabolic properties. Microbiologists try to classify microorganisms based on the structure of their cell walls, shape, and the substances they ingest. In 1965, Linus Pauling and Emile Zuckerkandl proposed using gene sequences in various prokaryotes to work out their relationships to one another. This approach, known as phylogenetics, is the main method used today. Archaea (then only known methanogens) were first classified as a separate group of bacteria on a phylogenetic tree based on their ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequence by Carl Woese and George E. Fox in 1977.",

However, this classification is no longer used. Woese and Fox argue that Archaebacteria are fundamentally different from other life: (1) the lack of peptidoglycan in their cell walls; (2) the presence of two unusual coenzymes; and (3) sequencing results of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. To emphasize these differences, Woese, Otto Kandler, and Mark Wheelis later proposed a new grouping system of organisms with three separate domains: Eukarya, Bacteria, and Archaea, in what is now known as the \"Woesian Revolution\". The word archaea comes from Ancient Greek \u1f00\u03c1\u03c7\u03b1\u1fd6\u03b1, meaning \"ancient things\", because the first representatives of the Archaea domain were methanogens and it was assumed that their metabolism reflected the primitive atmosphere of Earth and that they were ancient organisms. For a long time, archaea were seen as extremophiles only in extreme habitats such as hot springs and salt lakes. However, as more and more new habitats were studied, more and more archaea were discovered. Extreme halophilic and hyperthermophilic microbes also belong to Archaea. By the late 20th century, archaea had also been identified in non-extreme environments. Today, they are recognized as a large and diverse group of organisms that are widely distributed in nature. Archaea have gained a new appreciation for their role and presence since polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect prokaryotes from environmental samples (such as water or soil) by multiplying their ribosomal genes. This allows the detection and identification of organisms that have not yet been cultured in the laboratory. The classification of archaea, and of prokaryotes in general, is a fast-moving and contentious field.

Most of the well-studied and cultured species of archaea are members of two major phyla, Euryarchaeota and Crenarchaeota. Other groups are created tentatively. For example, the strange species Nanoarchaeum equitans, which was discovered in 2003 and has been given its own phylum, Nanoarchaeota. Korarchaeota has also been proposed as a new phylum containing a small group of thermophilic species that share characteristics with both main phyla, but are more closely related to Crenarchaeota. Other archaea species have been found to be distantly related to one of these groups, such as the Archaeal Richmond Mine acidophilic nanoorganisms (ARMAN) which were discovered in 2006 and are among the smallest known organisms. A superphylum, called TACK, which includes Thaumarchaeota, Aigarchaeota, Crenarchaeota, and Korarchaeota, was proposed in 2011 and may be related to organisms that became the ancestors of eukaryotes. In 2017, the superphylum Asgard was proposed as a group closer to eukaryotes and a sister group to TACK. The following is an archaea cladogram based on Tom A. Williams et al.

Archaea exhibit high rates of horizontal gene transfer between their lineages. Some researchers suggest that individuals should be grouped into species-like populations, whose genomes are very similar and who rarely transfer genes or receive gene transfer from other cells with less related genomes, such as those in the genus Ferroplasma. On the other hand, studies on Halorubrum found significant genetic transfer to/from less related populations, limiting the application of this criterion. A second concern is the extent to which species designations have practical meaning. Current knowledge of genetic diversity is incomplete and the number of archaea species cannot be estimated with any accuracy. Estimates of the number of phyla range from 18\u201323, but only eight phyla have representatives that have been cultured in the laboratory and studied directly. Many archaeal groups were hypothesized from only a single rRNA sequence, indicating that the differences between these organisms remain unclear. Bacteria also contain many uncultured microbes so that their characterization is also similar to that of archaea. The age of the Earth is estimated to be around 4.54 billion years. Scientific evidence suggests that life on Earth began at least 3.5 billion years ago. The earliest evidence of life on Earth is biogenic graphite in metasedimentary rock 3.7 billion years old found in West Greenland and fossilized microbial mats found in sandstone 3.48 billion years old in Western Australia.

In contrast, the unique fossil chemistry of lipids becomes more informative because these compounds are not present in other organisms. Some publications state that archaeal or eukaryotes' lipid remains are present in shale rocks dating to 2.7 billion years ago; although the data is questionable. These lipids were also detected in rocks even older than those in West Greenland. The oldest traces come from the Isua district of Greenland, which includes the oldest known sediments on Earth that formed 3.8 billion years ago. The archaic lineage is probably the most ancient lineage that exists on Earth. Woese argued that bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes represented separate lineages that branched off early from the ancestral colonies of all organisms. One possibility is that this branching occurred before cell evolution, when the absence of a cell membrane allowed unrestricted lateral gene transfer, and that the ancestry of the three domains arose from the fixation of specific gene subsets. It is possible that the last common ancestor of bacteria and archaea was a thermophile, so that lower temperatures may have provided an \"extreme environment\" for archaea, and organisms that lived in cold environments only appeared later. Because the related Archaea and Bacteria are more distant from each other than they are from eukaryotes, the term prokaryote may imply an incorrect similarity between archaea and bacteria.

A certain RNA molecule known as 16S ribosomal RNA (usually shortened to 16s rRNA) is of key importance in the production of proteins in all organisms. Because this function is so important to life, it is impossible for organisms to survive the 16s rRNA mutation, so the nucleotide structure is very stable (but not absolute) over many generations. The size of the 16s rRNA is also large enough to store organism-specific information, but small enough to be sequenced and compared in a short time. In 1977, Carl Woese, a microbiologist who studied the genetic sequence of organisms, developed a new comparison method that involved breaking RNA into fragments that could be sequenced and compared to other fragments from other organisms. The more similar the pattern of the fragments is between species, the more closely related they are. Woese used his new rRNA comparison method to classify and separate different organisms. He sequenced various species and found that a group of methanogens with rRNAs were very different from any known prokaryotes or eukaryotes. These methanogens were so much more similar to each other than to any other organisms that had been sequenced, that Woese proposed a new domain, Archaea. Woese's experiments showed that archaea are more similar to eukaryotes than prokaryotes, although they are more similar in structure to prokaryotes. This concludes that Archaea and Eukarya share a more recent common ancestor compared to Eukarya and Bacteria. The development of the cell nucleus occurred after the branching between the bacteria and this common ancestor.

Comparative analysis of archaea genomes has also identified several molecularly conserved special indels and certain proteins that are uniquely found both in all archaea and are found in several major groups within archaea. Another unique property of archaea is that no other known organism is capable of methanogenesis (production of methane through metabolism). Methanogenic archaea play an important role in ecosystems along with organisms that obtain energy from the oxidation of methane (most of them are bacteria) because they are often the main source of methane in these environments and can act as primary producers. Methanogens also play an important role in the carbon cycle, breaking down organic carbon into methane, which is also a major greenhouse gas. The relationships among the three domains are critical to understanding the origin of life. Most of the metabolic pathways (which are the object of most of the genes of an organism) are shared by Archaea and Bacteria, while most of the genes involved in genomic expression are shared by Archaea and Eukarya. Among prokaryotes, the cell structure of archaea most closely resembles that of Gram-positive bacteria, mainly because both have a single lipid bilayer and usually contain a thick saccule (exoskeleton) of various chemical compositions. In some phylogenetic trees based on the sequence of genes (proteins) of prokaryotes homologues, archaeal homologues are more closely related to Gram-positive bacterial homologues. Archaea and Gram-positive bacteria also share conserved indels in a number of important proteins, such as Hsp70 and glutamine synthetase\u00a0I; however, scientists interpret the phylogeny of these genes as a means of interdomain gene transfer, and may not reflect the relatedness of organisms.",

This view was advanced on the basis of the observation that archaea are resistant to antibiotics primarily directed against Gram-positive bacteria, and that these antibiotics act primarily on the genes that differentiate archaea from bacteria. This suggests that the selective pressure against resistance generated by Gram-positive antibiotics was eventually sufficient to cause widespread changes in many antibiotic target genes, and that these strains represent the common ancestor of today's archaea. The evolution of archaea in response to antibiotic selection, or other competitive selective pressures, could also explain their adaptation to environmental extremes (such as high temperature or acidity) as a result of searching for empty niches to escape antibiotic-producing organisms; Cavalier-Smith also made the same suggestion. This view is also supported by other studies investigating structural protein relationships and studies showing that Gram-positive bacteria may be the earliest branching lineages in prokaryotes. The evolutionary relationship between archaea and eukaryotes is still unclear. Aside from the similarities in cell structure and function discussed below, many genetic trees lump the two together in one group. Factors complicating their relationship include claims that the relationship between eukaryotes and the archaea phylum Crenarchaeota is closer than that between the phyla Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota, and the existence of archaea-like genes in certain bacteria, such as in Thermotoga maritimea, from horizontal gene transfer. The standard hypothesis holds that the ancestors of eukaryotes split from the Archaea early on, and that eukaryotes emerged by fusion between archaea and bacteria, which became the cell nucleus and cytoplasm; this explains many genetic similarities but makes it difficult to explain cell structure.",

Haloquadratum walsbyi is an archaea with flat, square-shaped cells that live in hypersaline pools. This unusual shape is probably well maintained by their prokaryotic cell wall and cytoskeleton. Proteins associated with components of the cytoskeleton of other organisms are found in archaea, and filaments form within their cells, but in contrast to other organisms, this cellular structure is poorly understood.

Another group of archaea use sunlight as a source of energy (they are called phototrophs). However, photosynthesis which produces oxygen does not occur in these organisms. Many basic metabolic pathways are shared by all life forms; for example, archaea use a modified form of glycolysis (the Entner\u2013Doudoroff pathway) as well as either the complete or partial citric acid cycle. These similarities to other organisms may reflect that these basic metabolic pathways have origins early in life history and high levels of efficiency. Some Euryarchaeota are methanogens that live in anaerobic environments, such as marshes. This form of metabolism evolved early on, and it is even possible that the first free-living organisms were methanogens. Generally, the reactions involve using carbon dioxide as the electron acceptor to oxidize hydrogen. Methanogenesis involves various coenzymes that are unique to these archaea, such as coenzyme M and metanofuran. Other organic compounds such as alcohol, acetic acid, or formic acid are used as alternative electron acceptors by methanogens. These reactions often occur in archaea living in the gut. Acetic acid is also cleaved to methane and carbon dioxide directly by acetotrophic archaea. Acetotrophs are archaea in the order Methanosarcinales and are the main part of the community of microorganisms that produce biogas.",

This process involves a highly modified form of the Calvin cycle or a recently discovered metabolic pathway called the 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate cycle. The Crenarchaeota also use the reverse Krebs cycle, while the Euryarchaeota also use the acetyl-CoA reductive pathway. This carbon fixation is supported by inorganic energy sources. No archaea are known to carry out photosynthesis. The energy sources of archaea are extremely diverse and range from the oxidation of ammonia by Nitrosopumilales to the oxidation of hydrogen sulfide or elemental sulfur by Sulfolobus species, which use oxygen or metal ions as electron acceptors. Phototrophic archaea use light to produce chemical energy in the form of ATP. In Halobacteria, light-activated ion pumps, such as bacteriorodopsin and halorodopsin, generate ion gradients by pumping ions out of the cell across the plasma membrane. The energy stored in the electrochemical gradient is then converted into ATP by ATP synthase. This process is a form of photophosphorylation. The ability of the pump to move ions across the membrane depends on light-activated changes in the structure of the retinol cofactor present in the center of the protein. Archaea usually have a single coiled chromosome, with a size of up to 5,751,492 base pairs in Methanosarcina acetivorans, the largest known archaean genome. One-tenth of this size is the small genome of 490,885 base pairs in Nanoarchaeum equitans, the smallest known archaean genome; the genome is thought to contain only 537 protein-encoding genes. Small independent pieces of DNA, called plasmids, are also found in archaea. Plasmids can be transferred between cells by physical contact, in a process that may be similar to bacterial conjugation. Archaea are genetically distinct from bacteria and eukaryotes; Up to 15% of the proteins encoded by each genome are proteins unique to the Archaea domain, although most of the unique genes have no known function.",

Another characteristic feature of archaea is the organization of genes whose functions are related\u2014such as enzymes catalyzing steps in the same metabolic pathway into new operons, and the great diversity in tRNA genes and their aminoacyl tRNA synthetases. Transcription in archaea more closely resembles eukaryotic transcription than bacterial transcription, with archaeal RNA polymerases closely similar to eukaryotes-like enzymes; while translation in archaea shows signs of similarity, both in bacteria and eukaryotes. Although archaea have only one type of RNA polymerase, their structure and function in transcription appears to be close to that of RNA polymerase II in eukaryotes, with the same set of proteins (general transcription factors) directing the binding of RNA polymerase to the gene promoter. However, other archaeal transcription factors are closer to the transcription factors found in bacteria. Archaeal post-transcriptional modifications are simpler than those of eukaryotes because most archaea genes are devoid of introns, although there are many introns in their transfer RNA and ribosomal RNA genes, and introns may be present in some protein-encoding genes. Halobacterium volcanii, an extreme halophilic archaea, forms cytoplasmic bridges between cells that are likely to be used to transfer DNA from one cell to another in both directions. When the hyperthermophilic archaea Sulfolobus solfataricus and Sulfolobus acidocaldarius are exposed to DNA-damaging ultraviolet (UV) radiation or to bleomycin or mitomycin C, species-specific cellular aggregation is induced.

This response may be a primitive form of sexual interaction similar to the better studied bacterial transformation system that is also linked to species-specific transfer of DNA between cells leading to repair of homologous recombination of DNA damage. Archaea are targets of a number of viruses that differ from those that attack bacteria and eukaryotes. These viruses have been grouped into 15\u201318 DNA-based families, but several species remain not isolated and are awaiting classification. These families can be informally divided into two groups: archaea-specific and cosmopolitan viruses. Archaea-specific viruses only target archaea species and currently cover 12 virus families. Many previously unidentified structurally unique viruses have been discovered in this group, including bottle, spindle, coil, and droplet-shaped viruses. Although the reproductive cycles and genomic mechanisms of archaea-specific virus species may be similar to those of other viruses, they have unique characteristics that are specifically developed due to the morphology of the host cells they infect. Their viral release mechanism is different from that of other phages. Bacteriophages generally follow the lytic pathway, the lysogenic pathway, or a mixture of the two (although this is rare). Most archaea-specific virus strains maintain a stable, somewhat lysogenic relationship with their host, which manifests as chronic infection.

Krupovic et al. (2018) stated that the high rate of horizontal gene transfer, the rapid mutation rate in the viral genome, and the lack of universal gene sequences have led researchers to perceive the evolutionary pathways of archaic viruses as networks. The lack of similarity between phylogenetic markers in this network and the global virosphere, as well as external links to nonviral elements, may indicate that some archaea-specific virus species evolved from nonviral cellular genetic elements (MGE). These viruses have been studied in detail in the thermophiles, particularly the orders Sulfolobales and Thermoproteales. Two groups of single-stranded DNA viruses that infect archaea have been isolated. One group is exemplified by Halorubrum pleomorphic virus 1 (\"Pleolipoviridae\") which infects halophilic archaea and the other by spiral aeropyrum viruses (\"Spiraviridae\") which infect hyperthermophilic hosts (optimal growth at 90\u201395\u00b0C). Spiraviridae is reported to have the largest ssDNA genome to date. Defense against these viruses may involve RNA interference from repetitive DNA sequences associated with the genes of the virus. Archaea reproduce asexually by binary or multiple fission, fragmentation, or budding; mitosis and meiosis do not occur, so if an archaean species has more than one form, they all share the same genetic material. Cell division is controlled in the cell cycle; after the cell's chromosomes are replicated and the two daughter chromosomes separate, the cell divides.

In cren- and thaumarchaea, the CDV cell division machinery plays a similar role. This machinery is related to the eukaryotic machinery ESCRT-III (which while best known for its role in cell division) is also seen to fulfill a role in dissociation in dividing cells, suggesting an ancestral role in cell division. Both bacteria and eukaryotes, but not archaea, form spores. Several species of Haloarchaea undergo phenotypic transitions and grow as several distinct cell types, including thick-walled structures that are resistant to osmotic shocks and allow archaea to survive in water at low salt concentrations, but these are not reproductive structures and may help them reach new habitats. Archaea live in a variety of habitats and are now recognized as a large part of global ecosystems, contributing up to 20% of the earth's biomass. The first archaea discovered were extremophiles. Some archaea are capable of surviving high temperatures, often above 100\u00b0C (212\u00b0F), such as those found in geysers, deep-sea hydrothermal vents and oil wells. Other common habitats include very cold habitats and very salty, acidic, or alkaline water. In addition, archaea also includes mesophyll that grows under mild conditions, such as in marshlands, wastewater, oceans, intestinal tracts of animals and soil.

Archaea Methanopyrus kandleri strain 116 can even reproduce at 122\u00b0C (252\u00b0F), the highest recorded temperature of any organism. Other archaea live in very acidic or alkaline conditions. For example, one of the most extreme acidophilic archaea is Picrophilus torridus, which grows at pH 0, which is equivalent to growing at 1.2 molar sulfuric acid. This resistance to extreme environments has made archaea a focus of speculation about the possible properties of extraterrestrial life. Some extremophile habitats are not dissimilar to Mars, so it is possible that suitable microbes could have been transferred between planets in meteorites. Several studies have shown that archaea not only exist in mesophilic and thermophilic environments but also live, sometimes in high numbers, at low temperatures. For example, archaea are mostly found in cold oceanic environments such as the polar seas. More significant is the finding of large numbers of archaea throughout the world's oceans in non-extreme habitats among the plankton community (as part of the picoplankton). Although these archaea can be present in very high numbers (up to 40% of microbial biomass), almost none of these species have been isolated and studied in pure culture.

It has been demonstrated that across all oceanic surface sediments (from 1,000 to 10,000 m water depth), the impact of viral infection is higher in archaea than in bacteria; meanwhile, virus-induced lysis of archaea accounts for up to one-third of the total microbial biomass killed, resulting in the release of ~0.3 to 0.5 gigatonnes of carbon per year globally. Archaea recycle elements such as carbon, nitrogen and sulfur in their various habitats. Archaea are involved in many steps of the nitrogen cycle, which includes reactions that remove nitrogen from ecosystems (such as nitrate-based respiration and denitrification) as well as nitrogen-gathering processes (such as nitrate assimilation and nitrogen fixation). The researchers found archaeal involvement in the ammonia oxidation reaction. These reactions are very important in the oceans. Archaea also appear to be important for the oxidation of ammonia in soil. They produce nitrites, and other microbes oxidize them to nitrates. Plants and other organisms consume nitrates. In the sulfur cycle, archaea that grow by oxidizing sulfur compounds release this element from rocks to make it available to other organisms. However, archaea that do this, such as Sulfolobus, produce sulfuric acid as a waste product, and growth of these organisms in abandoned mines can contribute to acid mine drainage and other environmental damage.

Methanogens act as the main partners that support the bacterial fermentation process which is based on syntrophy which works in conditions of lack of energy. One well-understood example of mutualism is the interaction between protozoa and methanogenic archaea in the digestive tracts of animals that digest cellulose, such as ruminants and termites. In this anaerobic environment, protozoa break down plant cellulose to obtain energy. This process releases hydrogen as a waste product, but high levels of hydrogen reduce energy production. When methanogens convert hydrogen to methane, the protozoa benefit with more energy. In anaerobic protozoa, such as Plagiopyla frontata, the archaea reside within the protozoa and consume the hydrogen produced in their hydrogenosomes. Archaea are also associated with larger organisms. For example, the marine archaea Cenarchaeum symbiosum lives in (is the endosymbiont of) the sponge Axinella mexicana. Archaea may also be commensals, benefiting from association without helping or harming other organisms. For example, the methanogen Methanobrevibacter smithii is the most common archaea in the human flora, making up about one in ten of all prokaryotes in the human gut.

The enzymes from these thermophilic archaea also tend to be very stable in organic solvents, so they can be used in environmentally friendly processes in green chemistry that synthesize organic compounds. This stability makes it easier to use in structural biology. Consequently, enzymes from extremophile archaea equivalent to bacterial or eukaryotic enzymes are frequently used in structural studies. In contrast to the various applications of archaeal enzymes, the use of archaeal organisms themselves in the field of biotechnology is underdeveloped. Methanogenic archaea are an important part of sewage treatment because they are part of the microorganism community that carry out anaerobic digestion and produce biogas.

        "paragraph": "Electronegativity or electronegativity (Symbol: \u03c7) is a chemical property that describes the ability of an atom (or less commonly a functional group) to attract electrons (or electron density) towards itself in a covalent bond. The concept of electronegativity was first introduced by Linus Pauling in 1932 as part of the development of valence bond theory. Electronegativity cannot be calculated directly, but must be calculated from the properties of other atoms and molecules. Several calculation methods have been proposed. Although within each method there is a slight difference in the numerical value of the electronegativity, all methods share the same period trend among elements. Electronegativity is one of the periodicity properties of elements, in addition to electron affinity, atomic radius, and ionization energy. The method that is generally used is the Pauling method. The results of this calculation produce a dimensionless value and are usually referred to as the Pauling scale with a relative scale ranging from 0.7 to 4.0 (hydrogen = 2.2). When other methods of calculation are used, there is a convention (although not required) to use the same scale range as the Pauling scale: this is known as electronegativity in Pauling units. Electronegativity is not a property of atoms, it is only a property of atoms in molecules. The property of a single atom that is equivalent to electronegativity is electron affinity. The electronegativity of an element will vary depending on the chemical environment, but is usually considered a transferable property, that is, a value of electronegativity is assumed to hold true in a variety of situations. Pauling first proposed the concept of electronegativity in 1932 as a description of the phenomenon that the covalent bond between two different atoms (A\u2013B) is stronger than would be expected by taking the average strength of the A\u2013A and B\u2013B bonds.

With this method, the electronegativity difference between hydrogen and bromine is 0.73 (dissociation energies: H\u2013Br 3.79\u00a0eV; H\u2013H 4.52\u00a0eV; Br\u2013Br 2.00\u00a0eV) Therefore only the electronegativity difference can be calculated , we need to choose a reference point to build the scale. Hydrogen is used as a reference because it forms covalent bonds with almost all elements. Its electronegativity value was first determined as 2.1, but later revised to 2.20. In addition, we also need to decide which element (of the two elements) has the greater electronegativity. This breaking can be done using \"chemical intuition\", for example in hydrogen bromide dissolving in water to form H+ and Br\u2212, we can assume that bromine is more electronegative than hydrogen. To calculate the Pauling electronegativity of an element, we need data on the dissociation energies of at least two types of covalent bonds formed by that element. Allred updated Pauling's electronegativity values \u200b\u200bin 1961 to incorporate thermodynamic data. It is these revised Pauling electronegativity values \u200b\u200bthat are often used. Mulliken proposed that the arithmetic mean of the first ionization energy and electron affinity must be a measure of the tendency of an atom to attract electrons. Because this definition is independent of any relative scale, it is also referred to as relative electronegativity, with units of kilojoules per mole or electronvolts. But usually we use a linear transformation to transform the absolute value into a value that is more similar to the Pauling value.

With known bond lengths, Sanderson's electronegativity allows us to estimate bond energies in various compounds. In addition, Sanderson's electronegativity is also used in various organic chemistry investigations. Allen's definition of electronegativity is one of the simplest. He proposed that electronegativity is related to the average energy of the valence electrons in a free atom, with \u03b5s,p being the one-electron energy of the s and p electrons in a free atom and ns,p being the number of s and p electrons in the valence shell.

The energy of one electron can be determined directly from spectroscopic data, so the electronegativity calculated by this method is sometimes referred to as spectroscopic electronegativity. The necessary data are available for most elements, allowing us to estimate electronegativity values \u200b\u200bfor elements that cannot be calculated by other methods, for example francium with an allen electronegativity value = 0.67.n 2] However it is not clear what should be considered as valence electrons for d and f block elements, causing ambiguity in electronegativity calculations using the Allen method.",

Allen list of electronegativities for the main groups of elements Recently, a new electronegativity scale based on the electrophilicity of chemical systems was proposed by Noorizadeh and Shakerzadeh. In this scale it can be seen that it has a significant correlation with the electronegativity of Pauling and Allred-Rochow. Various methods of calculating electronegativity but all giving well-correlated results indicate that several chemical properties are likely to be affected by electronegativity. The greatest application of electronegativity is in bond polarity as introduced by Pauling. In general, the greater the electronegativity difference between two atoms, the more polar the bond will form with the atom having the greater electronegativity as the negative pole of the dipole. Pauling proposed an equation relating the \"ionic character\" of a bond to the difference in electronegativity of the two atoms, but this equation has been greatly diminished in use. Some correlation exists between the infrared strain frequency of the bonds and the electronegativities of the atoms involved: however this is not surprising since the strain frequencies depend partially on the bond strengths taken into account in the Pauling electronegativity calculations. A more convincing correlation is seen in the correlation between electronegativity and chemical shifts in NMR spectroscopy or isomeric shifts in M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy (see figure). Both of these measurements depend on the s-electron density of the nucleus, so they are a good indication that the different measurements of electronegativity really describe \"the ability of an atom in a molecule to attract electrons towards itself\". In general, electronegativity increases periodically from left to right and decreases from top to bottom. Thus, fluorine is undoubtedly the element with the greatest electronegativity, while cesium is the least based on experimental data (the value of 0.7 Francium is obtained from extrapolation). n 2] There are several exceptions to this general rule, Gallium and germanium have greater electronegativity than aluminum and silicon due to d-block contraction. The elements of the fourth period after the first row of the transition metals have smaller atomic radii than usual because the 3d electrons are not effective at shielding the increased nuclear charge, so that a smaller atomic size correlates with a higher electronegativity value ( see Allred-Rochow Electronegativity and Sanderson Electronegativity above).",

In inorganic chemistry, it is common to think of a single electronegativity value as valid for most \"normal\" situations. This approach makes calculations extremely simple. Yet it is clear that the electronegativity of an element is not an invariable property of the atom. Specifically, electronegativity depends on the oxidation state of an element. Allred used the Pauling method to calculate electronegativities separately for the different oxidation states of the most commonly encountered elements (including tin and lead). However, for most elements, there are not enough distinct covalent compounds to allow this approach to be made. This is clearly seen in the transition elements whose electronegativity values \u200b\u200bare the average values \u200b\u200bof several different oxidation states, making it difficult to see electronegativity trends. The consequences of this increase in electronegativity can be seen in the structures of oxides and halides, and in the acidity of oxides and oxoacids. CrO3 and Mn2O7 are acidic oxides with low melting points, while Cr2O3 is an amphoteric oxide and Mn2O3 is a basic oxide. Other effects are also evident at the acid dissociation constant of oxoacid chlorine. The higher the oxidation state of the central chlorine atom, the more electron density is attracted from the oxygen atom towards the chlorine, thereby reducing the partial negative charge of the oxygen atom and increasing the acidity. In organic chemistry, electronegativity is associated more with functional groups than with individual atoms. The terms group electronegativity and substituent electronegativity are used synonymously.

The Mighty Pure God (Ling-Bao Tian-Song) watches over Shang-Qing's heaven. The three are often depicted as three elders on a throne. The Taoist School of Learning developed from each of these Gods. Daoist alchemy forms a large part of these schools, as each of the Three Pure Ones represents one of the three essential areas of learning: jing, qi, and shen. The fusion of the three results in a return to Tao. The first Pure God is universal and celestial chi. The second is human nature chi, and the third is earth chi. Heavenly chi includes the chi or energy of all the planets, stars and constellations as well as the energy of the Gods (creativity and universal love). Human nature chi is the energy that exists on the surface of the earth and sustains human life. The energy of the earth includes all the forces that exist within the planet as well as the forces of the five elements. Even though the Three Pure Ones were manifestations of Primordial Heavenly Energy, they were intangible. However, to illustrate their role in Creation, they are often depicted as old men wearing robes colored in the three basic colors from which all colors originate: Red, Blue, and Yellow (or Green) depending on individual interpretation.

        "paragraph": "A biome is a region that has a common geographic or climatic feature that includes communities of plants, animals, soil organisms, bacteria, and viruses. The biome scope includes several ecosystems with large and distinct regional elements of the biosphere. A biome is characterized by the presence of distinct plant and animal communities. On Earth, biomes can be grouped into seven major biome types, namely tropical rainforest, savanna, prairie, desert, deciduous forest, tundra, and taiga. The vegetation that occurs in each environment has its own uniqueness. The uniqueness of plant vegetation is a form of plant adaptation to a unique growth environment. Desert biomes are found in North America, North Africa, Australia, and Western Asia. The main characteristics of the desert biome are very low rainfall and water evaporation is faster than precipitation. Rainfall is only able to reach 25 cm per year. In addition, the humidity in the air is very low and the temperature difference during the day and at night is very high. The ambient temperature during the day can reach 40oC and night temperatures can reach 0oC. The nature of the soil in the desert biome is unable to store water so it is very barren. In the desert biome, plants are generally xerophytes and are able to adapt to dry areas. Meanwhile, the fauna feature of the desert biome is large animals. The types of animals in the desert biome that are active all the time are only those that are able to store water reserves, for example camels. Meanwhile, rodents, reptiles and insects are only active in the morning and hide in holes during the day because of the hot sun. Plants that live in the desert have thorns and are leafless. Xerophytic plants have a smaller surface area than their volume which causes cell size to decrease and cell walls to thicken.",

    {
        "paragraph": "In addition, the vascular and stomata tissue systems are denser and the amount of column tissue increases, while spongy tissue decreases. Xerophytic plants also have long roots so they can take water from deep places. Plants that grow in the desert include succulent plants whose leaves are often covered with hairs and whose organ tissues are capable of storing water. Reducing the size of the leaves is a form of adaptation from an arid place. Small leaves cause the rate of transpiration to decrease so that water in the sponge tissue can be stored longer. The prairie biome covers the tropics to areas with a temperate climate. This type of prairie biome can be found in Hungary, Southern Russia, Central Asia, South America, and Australia. The prairie biome has a rainfall that ranges from 25\u201350 cm per year. Meanwhile, in some other areas, rainfall can reach 100 cm per year. The decrease in rainfall levels occurs irregularly so that porosity and drainage are not good. The impact of this irregular rainfall is that it is difficult for plants to absorb water. In the meadows there are almost no trees. The prairie biome consists only of herbaceous plants and grass. Plants that grow in the grassland biome thrive depending on humidity. In grasslands, the most commonly found vegetation is grass. In wet prairie areas, the live grasses can reach up to three meters in size, such as Bluestem grass and Sorghastrum pea. In dry prairie areas, the grass size is very short, for example blue grama grass and buffalo grass. The height of the grass is directly proportional to the amount of rainfall. The savanna biome is grasslands located in tropical and sub-tropical climates.",

The savanna biome includes areas of open land characterized by dry, semi-arid or semi-humid climates. In savannas that have low rainfall, the vegetation will turn into shrubs. Conversely, in areas with high rainfall, plant vegetation will turn into wet forest. In the savanna, the plant vegetation that is often found is woody plants, herbaceous plants, and various species of legumes. Common woody plants found are acacia, rubber vines, peas, chicken dung, and centong cactus. Meanwhile, herbaceous plants that are often found include digitaria, anjan grass, sangketan, carrot grass, and pencil flower. Sea ice biomes are biomes that are located in sea ice or on floating frozen seawater. The formation of the sea ice biome is the result of the interaction of all marine organisms from the polar oceans. The tropical forest biome is a biome that always receives rain throughout the year with high rainfall. Tropical forests are located in the tropics at latitudes of 23.5oS to 23.5oS. Rainfall in tropical forests can reach 2000 mm per year. Plant vegetation in humid tropical forests has broad leaves and tall trees that are dense so that there is a canopy. The distance between the trees is very close and the trees have a wide diameter so that sunlight does not penetrate all the way to the forest floor. The atmosphere of the tropical forest is quite dark and feels damp. Tropical forests produce 40% of the oxygen on earth. In addition, tropical forests are a repository of world carbon stocks. Various types of plants can grow in humid tropical forests.",

Tree leaves are always green, wide and thick. Humid tropical forests are the habitat for most of the world's flora and fauna. Biodiversity and fauna diversity in tropical forests is very high. Types of animals that generally live in tropical forests are mammals, reptiles, birds, amphibians and insects. On Earth there are three main zones of tropical forests namely the South American zone, the Southeast Asian zone, and the African Zone. The South American zone extends from Veracruz, the Caribbean, south of the Orinoco River and the Amazon Basin, Andes, Ecuador and Peru. The Southeast Asian zone includes Indochina, Myanmar, Papua New Guinea, southwest India and Queensland. The African zone covers the Zaire Basin as its center, while the outermost part extends from Dahomey to Sierra Leone (southern boundary) and Madagascar (western boundary). The deciduous forest biome has plants with leaves that drop in winter. The existence of a deciduous forest biome can be found in the United States, Western Europe, East Asia, and Chile. The deciduous forest biome has evenly distributed rainfall throughout the year, there are four distinct seasons, and low biodiversity. Rainfall in the deciduous forest biome ranges from 75\u2013100 cm per year. The deciduous forest biome experiences summer, winter, fall, and spring. In summer, the deciduous forest biome receives solar radiation energy and high rainfall and high humidity levels.

Solar radiation begins to decrease just before winter so that the ambient temperature begins to decrease. As winter approaches, plants begin to experience physical changes. Plant leaves begin to turn red or brown due to difficulty getting water. In autumn, the leaves of the trees begin to fall. In winter, plants cannot carry out photosynthetic activities so that all their leaves cannot grow. In addition, animals in the deciduous forest biome also hibernate in winter. The ambient temperature rises again in spring. Towards summer, rising temperatures then melting snow plants start to leaf again. The types of trees in deciduous forests range from ten to twenty species. The distance between the trees is not too tight. The leaves of the trees mostly grow wide, and change color to a golden red in the fall. In winter, the leaves of the trees fall. The most common tree species in the deciduous forest biome are oaks, hickories, maples, populuses, and sycamores. In deciduous forest, plant vegetation is divided into five zones. The first zone covers the forest canopy with trees between 60 meters and 100 meters high. The first zone is inhabited by oak, fagus, maple, chestnut, hickory, elm, cypress, linden, and sweet gum. The second zone is inhabited by small and young trees. Plants in the second zone are more able to adapt to shady conditions. The second zone consists of trees with a short size. The third zone is the bush zone. Plants that grow include laurel wreaths, rhododendrons, azaleas, and hake berries.

Plants experience growth during the summer which lasts up to 6 months. Plants that are often found in the taiga forest biome are conifers or conifers. The types of conifers found are mainly merkusus pine. The taiga forest biome has low plant diversity so it is included in a homogeneous forest type. The type of vegetation and tree species are almost uniform. Throughout the year, the plants grow lush and leafy even though the winter brings very low ambient temperatures. The fauna found in the taiga forest biome are black bears, take them, wolves. In winter, the taiga forest biome gets additional fauna in the form of birds migrating to the tropics. In addition, there are squirrels and small mammals that hibernate in winter. The taiga forest biome has very different ambient temperatures in different seasons. The large difference in temperature values \u200b\u200bmakes the plant vegetation very non-diverse and only a few types of plants can grow. In the taiga forest biome, shrubs and wet plants are rarely found. Most of the taiga forest biome is inhabited by conifers. Conifers found within the taiga forest biome generally have conical crowns.

The plants that grow in the tundra biome are mostly mosses and lichens. Other plants in the tundra biome have a very small amount, namely grasses and flowering plants with small sizes. The tundra biome is an area that has very long winters so it gets very little solar radiation energy. Winter can last as long as 9 months, so it's always dark inside the tundra biome. Plant growth occurs in summer which lasts only 3 months. In the tundra biome, there are two typical fauna, namely muskox and wildebeest. The tundra biome can be divided into two types, namely arctic tundra and alpine tundra. The Arctic tundra is located around the North Pole and is the youngest biome in the world. The Arctic tundra region extends southward into the conifer forests of the taiga. Alpine tundra sits at relatively high altitudes over cold mountains around the world. One of the alpine tundra areas is at the top of the Jayawijaya mountains (Papua). In alpine tundra, it is very difficult for trees to grow because the soil does not have enough nutrients. The height of the plants growing within the tundra biome is only that of the average bush. The plants that are abundant in this area are included in the type of moss, especially spongnum and lichen.

Meanwhile, lichen and algae grow on rock slopes. The mangrove forest biome is found along gently sloping coasts. The climate of the region lies in the tropics and subtropics. The most common plant species in the mangrove forest biome are mangroves. In the mangrove forest biome, fires and red pidada are also found. The mangrove forest biome has high levels of salt in the water and soil. Conversely, oxygen levels in the water and soil are low. The mangrove forest biome is very susceptible to flooding during high tide. When the water recedes, the ground becomes muddy and muddy. The mangrove forest biome environment is surrounded by a lot of water. However, mangrove forest plants find it difficult to absorb water due to the high salt content. Lack of water that can be absorbed makes mangrove forest plants have thick and stiff leaves. This leaf shape aims to prevent too much evaporation through the cuticle layer. Mangrove forest plants also have respiratory roots to adapt to low oxygen levels. Breath roots function to absorb oxygen directly from the air. The moss forest biome is mostly found on mountain slopes or mountains. Moss forests form in areas that are at the limit of water vapor condensation. The plants that are found in the moss forest biome are mosses. Moss growth occurs on the surface of the soil, rocks, and woody tree trunks.",

The character \"X\" is the Roman number for ten, which this version is a successor to the operating systems used earlier such as Mac OS 8 and Mac OS 9. Some people read it as the letter \"X\" which sounds like \"ex\". One of the reasons why they interpret this way is because of tradition to name a Unix-based operating system with the suffix \"x\" (eg AIX, IRIX, Linux, Minix, Ultrix, Xenix). macOS Server was also released in 2001. Basically the Server version is similar to the standard version, with the difference that the Server version includes software for workgroup management and administration on large-scale computers.

The NeXTSTEP kernel is based on the Mach kernel, which was originally developed at Carniege Mellon University, with the kernel and additional code are from BSD. The graphical interface is built with an object-oriented GUI toolkit using the Objective-C programming language.

Mac OS X was originally announced as the 10th version of the operating system for Macintosh computers. The previous operating system, Mac OS Classic used Arabic numerals, such as Mac OS 8 and Mac OS 9. The \"X\" in Mac OS X refers to the number 10 in the Roman numerals, and Apple emphasizes that it should be pronounced as \"ten\", but also often pronounced as the letter \"X\". The first version of Mac OS X, Mac OS X Server 1.0, was a transitional product, using an interface similar to Mac OS Classic. The Mac OS X consumer release added the ability to run earlier versions of Mac OS applications. Mac OS X applications can be rewritten using the Carbon API, but can also be run directly using the Classic Environment with reduced performance. The consumer version of Mac OS X was released in 2001 with Mac OS X 10.0. Received mixed reviews, with positive marks for Aqua's interface but negative marks for slow performance. Some application developers such as FrameMaker and PageMaker did not develop new versions for Mac OS X because Apple was not very popular at that time. ArsTechnica writer John Siracusa, who reviewed each version of Mac OS X, explained that the initial release was painfully slow and lacking in features, and considered Aqua to be a performance burden.

As such, it is one of the four basic states of matter (the others being solid, gas, and plasma), and is the only state with a definite volume but no definite shape. Liquids consist of particles of matter with fine vibrations, such as atoms, held together by intermolecular forces. Water is, by far, the most common liquid on Earth. Like gases, liquids can flow and take the shape of their container. Most liquids are incompressible, although others are compressible. Unlike gases, liquids do not spread to fill every space of the container, and maintain a fairly constant density. A characteristic property of the liquid state is surface tension, which leads to the wetting phenomenon. The density of liquids is usually close to that of solids, and much higher than that of gases. Therefore, liquid and solid are both called condensed matter. On the other hand, since liquids and gases share the ability to flow, they are both called fluids. Although water is abundant on Earth, this state of matter is actually the least common in the known universe, because the existence of liquid requires a relatively narrow temperature/pressure range. Most known matter in the universe exists in the gaseous state (with detectable traces of dense matter) as interstellar clouds or in the plasma form within stars. Liquid is one of the four main states of matter, along with solid, gas and plasma. Fluid is fluid. Unlike solids, molecules in liquids have much greater freedom of movement. The forces that bind molecules together in solids are only temporary in liquids, allowing the liquid to flow while the solid remains rigid.",

If the liquid is placed in the bag, it can be pressed into any shape. Unlike gases, liquids are nearly incompressible. It has a nearly constant volume over a wide pressure range; it does not expand to fill the empty space in a container but forms its own surface, and does not always mix easily with other liquids. This property makes the fluid suitable for applications such as hydraulics. The liquid particles are held together tightly but not rigidly. They are able to move freely, resulting in a limited degree of particle mobility. As the temperature increases, the molecular vibrations increase causing the distance between molecules to increase. When the liquid reaches its boiling point, the cohesive forces holding the molecules together are broken, and the liquid turns into a gas (unless superheating occurs). If the temperature drops, the distance between the molecules gets closer and closer. When a liquid reaches its freezing point, the molecules usually lock together into a specific order, which is called crystallization, and the bonds between them become more rigid, turning the liquid into its solid state (unless supercooling occurs). There are only two elements that are liquids at standard temperature and pressure: mercury and bromine. Four other elements have melting points just above room temperature: francium, cesium, gallium and rubidium. Metal alloys that are liquid at room temperature include NaK, sodium-potassium alloys, galinstan, and some amalgams (alloys involving mercury).

Not all gases can be liquefied at atmospheric pressure, for example carbon dioxide can only be liquefied at pressures above 5.1 atm.

Examples include liquid crystals, which are used in LCD screens, and biological membranes. Liquids have a variety of uses, as lubricants, solvents, and coolants. In a hydraulic system, fluids act as power conductors. In tribology, fluids are studied for their properties as lubricants. Lubricants such as oil are selected for their viscosity and flow characteristics which are suitable for the entire operating temperature range of the components. Oils are frequently used in engines, gearboxes, metal works, and hydraulic systems because of their good lubricating properties. Many liquids are used as solvents, to dissolve other solids or liquids. Solutions are widely used for a variety of applications, including paints, sealants, and glues. Naphtha and acetone are often used in industry to remove oil, grease and tar from parts and engines. Body fluids are water-based solutions. Surfactants are commonly found in soaps and detergents.

Heat can be removed by flowing the liquid through a heat exchanger, such as a radiator, or heat can be removed when the liquid evaporates. Water or glycol coolants are used to keep the engine from overheating. Coolants used in nuclear reactors include water or molten metals, such as sodium or bismuth. A thin layer of liquid propellant is used to cool the thrust chamber of the rocket. In machining\u00a0\u00a0en], water and oil are used to dissipate the excess heat generated, which can quickly damage machine parts and tools. During perspiration, sweat removes heat from the human body through evaporation. In the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) industry, fluids, such as water, are used to transfer heat from one area to another. Fluid is the main component of hydraulic systems, which make use of Pascal's law to generate fluid power. Devices such as pumps and waterwheels have been used to convert fluid motion into mechanical work since ancient times. The oil is pressed through a hydraulic pump, which applies force to the hydraulic tubing. Hydraulics can be found in many applications, such as vehicle brakes and transmissions, heavy equipment, and aircraft control systems. Various hydraulic presses\u00a0en] are used extensively in repair and manufacturing, for lifting, pressing, clamping and shaping. Liquids are sometimes used in measuring instruments. Thermometers often use the thermal expansion of liquids, such as mercury, combined with their flowability to indicate temperature. The manometer uses the weight of the liquid to measure air pressure. The quantity of liquid is measured in units of volume. This includes the SI unit cubic meter (m3) and its derivatives, especially the cubic decimeter, which is more commonly referred to as the liter (1 dm3 = 1 L = 0.001m3), and the cubic centimeter, which is also called the milliliter (1 cm3 = 1 mL = 0.001 L = 10\u22126 m3).",

Water at temperatures between 0\u00b0C and 4\u00b0C is an exception. Liquids have little compressibility. Water, for example, only 46.4 parts per million will be compressed for every unit increase in atmospheric pressure (bar). At a pressure of about 4,000 bar (58,000 psi), at room temperature, water only loses 11% in volume. In the study of fluid dynamics, fluids are often treated as incompressible, especially when studying incompressible flow en]. The incompressibility makes fluids suitable for transmitting hydraulic power, since very little energy is lost in compression. However, the very small compressibility does cause other phenomena. The impact on the pipe, called a water hammer, occurs when the valve suddenly closes, creating an enormous pressure spike in the valve that travels backwards through slightly below the speed of sound. Another phenomenon caused by the incompressibility of liquids is cavitation. Because liquids have little elasticity, they can actually be pulled apart in areas of high turbulence or dramatic changes in direction, such as the trailing edge of a boat propeller or sharp corners in a pipe. The liquid in the area of \u200b\u200blow pressure (vacuum) evaporates and forms bubbles, which then collapse as they enter the area of \u200b\u200bhigh pressure. This causes the liquid to fill in the voids left by the bubbles with tremendous localized force, eroding the adjacent solid surface. In a gravitational field, the liquid exerts pressure on the sides of the container as well as on anything else inside the liquid itself. This pressure is transmitted in all directions and increases with depth. If the fluid is at rest in a uniform gravitational field, the pressure, p, at any depth, z, is given by: Note that this formula assumes that the pressure on the free surface is zero, and the effects of surface tension are negligible.",

(Buoyancy is also observed in other fluids, but is especially strong in liquids because of their high density.) The surface of the liquid, where surface tension appears, behaves like an elastic membrane, allowing the formation of droplets and bubbles. Surface waves, capillary action, wetting, and ripples are other consequences of surface tension. In confined liquids, which are defined on the basis of geometric constraints at the nanoscopic scale, most molecules experience some surface effects, which can result in physical properties that greatly diverge from those of the bulk liquid. A free surface is a fluid surface that is subjected to zero pressure either perpendicular to the normal or parallel to the shear, such as the boundary between, for example, water and air in the Earth's atmosphere. The liquid level (as in, for example, the water level) is the height of the free surface of the liquid, specifically the uppermost surface. The liquid level can be measured using a level sensor. Viscosity measures the resistance of a liquid to deformation due to shear stress and external pressure. In other words, viscosity is a fluid's resistance to flow. When a liquid is supercooled towards the glass transition, its viscosity increases dramatically. The liquid then becomes a viscoelastic medium which exhibits elasticity like a solid as well as fluidity like a liquid, depending on the observation time scale or perturbation frequency. The speed of sound in a fluid is expressed by the equation c=K/\u03c1{\\displaystyle c={\\sqrt {K/\\rho }}} where K is the compression modulus of the fluid, and \u03c1 is the density. In fresh water, c = 1497 m/s at 25 \u00b0C At temperatures below the boiling point, any matter in liquid form will evaporate until the condensation of the gas above it reaches equilibrium.

Liquids at their boiling point will evaporate faster than their gas condenses at the prevailing pressure. Liquids at or above their boiling point will normally boil, although superheating can prevent this in certain situations. At temperatures below its freezing point, liquids tend to crystallize, turning into solids. Unlike the transition to gas, there is no equilibrium in this transition under constant pressure, so the liquid will eventually completely crystallize unless supercooling occurs. It should be noted that this is only true under constant pressure, so suppose that water and ice in a tightly closed, strong container could achieve equilibrium in the two phases coexisting. For the reverse transition from solid to liquid, see liquefaction. The phase diagram explains why liquids do not exist in space or any other vacuum medium. Because the pressure is zero (except on the surface or interior of planets and moons), water and other liquids exposed to space will quickly boil or freeze depending on their temperature. In regions of space near Earth, water freezes when exposed to direct sunlight and evaporates (sublimes) soon after exposure to sunlight. If water exists as ice on the moon, it exists only in shadowy pits where the sun never shines and in places surrounded by rocks where there is insufficient heat. At some points near Saturn's orbit, sunlight is too weak to sublimate ice into water vapor. This is evident from the longevity of the ice that forms Saturn's rings.

This is evidenced by the absence of Bragg\u00a0en] peaks in both X-ray and neutron diffraction. Under normal conditions, the diffraction pattern has circular symmetry, indicating isotropy of the liquid. In the radial direction, the diffraction intensity oscillates smoothly.

Millions of people died in Japanese-occupied Asian countries under the slogan of the Common Prosperity of Asia. Almost all of Japan's industry and infrastructure were destroyed by the war. The Allies carried out a large-scale repatriation of ethnic Japanese from Asian countries that had been occupied by Japan. The International Military Tribunal for the Far East organized by the Allies from 3 May 1946 ended with the imposition of sentences for a number of Japanese leaders who were found guilty of committing war crimes. In 1947, Japan enacted a new Japanese Constitution. Based on the new constitution, Japan is defined as a country that adheres to pacifism and prioritizes the practice of liberal democracy. The United States occupation of Japan officially ended in 1952 with the signing of the Treaty of San Francisco. Despite this, US forces have maintained important bases in Japan, particularly on Okinawa. The United Nations officially accepted Japan as a member in 1956. After World War II, Japan experienced rapid economic growth, and placed Japan as the second largest economic power in the world, with an average gross domestic product growth of 10% per years for four decades. Japan's rapid economic growth ended in the early 1990s after the collapse of the bubble economy. Japan has more than 3,000 islands located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean east of the Asian continent. The term Japanese Archipelago refers to the four major islands, from north to south, Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu, as well as the Ryukyu Islands which are south of Kyushu. About 70% to 80% of Japan's territory consists of forested mountains, and suitable for agriculture, industry, and settlements.",

Therefore, population settlements are concentrated in coastal areas. Japan is one of the most densely populated countries in the world. Japan experiences low-magnitude earthquakes and the occasional volcanic eruption due to its location above the Pacific Ring of Fire at the confluence of three tectonic plates. Destructive earthquakes often cause tsunamis. Every century, Japan has several tsunamis. The major earthquakes that have recently occurred in Japan are the 2004 Ch\u016betsu Earthquake and the Great Hanshin Earthquake of 1995. Geographical circumstances mean that Japan has many hot springs, and most of them have been developed as tourist destinations. Japan is in a temperate climate with four distinct seasons. However, there are significant climatic differences between the northern and southern regions. In winter, northern Japan, such as Hokkaido, experiences winter, but in contrast, the southern part of Japan has a subtropical climate. The climate is also influenced by monsoons that blow from the Asian continent to the Pacific Ocean in winter, and vice versa in summer. Japan's climate is divided into six climate zones: The highest temperature ever recorded in Japan was 40.9\u00b0C (105.6\u00b0F) on August 16, 2007.

The 1980s was the golden age of automotive and electronic goods exports to Europe and the United States, resulting in a surplus in the trade balance which resulted in trade conflicts. After the signing of the 1985 Plaza Agreement, the US dollar depreciated against the yen.

If a farmer looks at all of these aspects with consideration of efficiency to achieve maximum profit then he does intensive farming. Agricultural business viewed in this way is known as agribusiness. Programs and policies that direct agricultural businesses to this perspective are known as intensification. Because industrial agriculture has always applied intensive farming, the two are often confused. The side of industrial agriculture that pays attention to its environment is sustainable agriculture. Sustainable agriculture, also known as its variations such as organic farming or permaculture, incorporates aspects of the sustainability of the carrying capacity of the land as well as the environment and local knowledge as important factors in calculating its efficiency. As a result, sustainable agriculture usually yields lower yields than industrial agriculture. Modern agriculture today usually employs some components of both poles of the agricultural \"ideology\" mentioned above. In addition to these two, there are also known forms of extensive farming (low input agriculture) which in the most extreme and traditional forms will take the form of subsistence farming, which is only carried out without business motives and solely to fulfill one's own needs or that of the community. As a business, agriculture has two important characteristics: it always involves large volumes of goods and the production process has a relatively high risk. These two characteristics arise because agriculture involves living things in one or several stages and requires space for these activities and a certain period of time in the production process.

Proponents of organic farming such as Sir Albert Howard argued that in the early 20th century, excessive and long-term use of synthetic pesticides and fertilizers was detrimental to soil fertility.",

Since the 1990s, there has been resistance to the environmental effects of conventional agriculture, particularly regarding water pollution, resulting in the growth of the organic movement. One of the main drivers of this movement was the world's first organic food certification, carried out by the European Union in 1991, and the start of reforms to the European Union Common Agricultural Policy in 2005. The growth of organic agriculture has renewed research into alternative technologies such as integrated pest management. and selective breeding. The latest technological developments that are widely used are genetically modified food ingredients. In late 2007, several factors pushed up the price of grains consumed by humans and livestock, causing increases in the prices of wheat (up to 58%), soybeans (up to 32%), and maize (up to 11%) in one year. The biggest contribution has been the increasing demand for grain as an ingredient in animal feed in China and India, and the conversion of food grains into biofuel products. This led to riots and demonstrations demanding lower food prices. The International Fund for Agricultural Development proposes that increasing small-scale agriculture can be a solution to increase food supply and food security. Their vision is based on the development of Vietnam moving from a food importer to a food exporter, and experiencing a significant reduction in poverty due to an increase in the number and volume of small agricultural businesses in their country.

Economists measure total factor agricultural productivity and find that the United States is now 1.7 times more productive than in 1948. Six countries in the world, namely the United States, Canada, France, Australia, Argentina and Thailand supply 90% of the food grains traded in the world. The resulting water deficit has increased grain imports in many developing countries, and is likely to occur in larger countries such as China and India. In 2011, the International Labor Organization (abbreviated as ILO) stated that there were at least 1 billion more people working in the agricultural sector. Agriculture accounts for at least 70% of child labour, and in many countries women also work in this sector more than any other sector. Only the service sector has outperformed the share of agricultural workers in 2007. Between 1997 and 2007, the share of the agricultural workforce fell and is a trend that will continue. The number of workers employed in agriculture varies in different countries, ranging from 2% in developed countries such as the United States and Canada, to 80% in various countries in Africa. In developed countries, this figure is significantly lower than in the previous century. In the 16th century, between 55\u201375% of Europe's population worked in agriculture.

Farmers around the world work at high risk of injury, lung disease, hearing loss, skin disease, as well as certain cancers due to the use of chemicals and long-term sun exposure. In industrial agriculture, injuries regularly occur from the use of agricultural tools and machinery, and the main cause of injuries is serious. Pesticides and other chemicals are also harmful to health. Workers exposed to pesticides in the long term can cause fertility damage. In industrialized countries where the family all works on the farms they develop themselves, the whole family is at risk. The main causes of fatal accidents in agricultural workers are drowning and injuries caused by machinery. The ILO states that agriculture is one of the economic sectors that endangers the workforce. It is estimated that the death of workers in this sector is at least 170 thousand people per year. Various cases of death, injury, and illness due to agricultural activities are often not reported as incidents due to agricultural activities. The ILO has developed the Health and Safety in Agriculture Convention, 2001, which covers the risks to work in agriculture, the prevention of these risks, and the role of individuals and organizations related to agriculture. The cropping system may vary for each farming area, depending on the availability of resources and constraints; geography and climate; government policy; economic, social, and political pressures; and peasant philosophy and culture. Shifting agriculture (slash and burn) is a system where forests are burned. The nutrients left in the soil after burning can support the cultivation of annual and perennial crops for several years. Then the plots are abandoned to allow the forest to grow back and the farmer moves on to the next patch of forest which will be used as agricultural land.",

The cultivation of annuals developed from this culture. Farmers do not move, but require higher input intensity of fertilizer and pest control. Industrialization brought about monoculture farming where one cultivar is cultivated on a very large area of \u200b\u200bland. Due to the low level of biodiversity, the use of nutrients tends to be uniform and pests can accumulate in the fields, resulting in increased use of fertilizers and pesticides. On the other hand, a crop rotation system grows successive different crops in a year. Intercropping is when different crops are grown at the same time and on the same land, which is also known as polyculture. In subtropical and arid environments, the planting period is limited to the presence of a rainy season so that it is not possible to grow many annual crops in rotation in a year, or irrigation is required. In all of these types of environments, perennial crops such as coffee and cocoa and agroforestry practices can grow. In temperate climates where grasslands and savannah grow in abundance, the practice of cultivating annual crops and grazing animals is predominant. Livestock production systems can be defined on the basis of feed sources used, which consist of grazing-based, full-house, and mixed livestock systems. In 2010, 30% of the world's land was used for livestock production, employing over 1.3 billion people. Between the 1960s and 2000s there was a significant increase in livestock production, calculated from the number and mass of carcasses, especially in the production of beef, pork and chicken meat. Production of chicken meat during this period increased 10 times. Non-meat animal products such as cow's milk and chicken eggs also showed a significant increase.",

Aquaculture is the production of fish and other aquatic animals in a controlled environment for human consumption. This sector also saw yields increase by an average of 9% per year between 1975 and 2007. During the 20th century, livestock and fish producers used selective breeding to create animal breeds and hybrids that increased yields, regardless of desire to maintain genetic diversity. These trends lead to a significant reduction in genetic diversity and resources in livestock breeds, leading to reduced resistance of livestock to disease. Local adaptations that previously existed in many local race livestock also began to disappear. Grazing-based livestock production relies heavily on landscapes such as grasslands and savannas to feed ruminants. Animal manure is the main nutritional input for the vegetation, but other inputs besides animal manure can be provided depending on needs. This system is important in areas where agricultural crop production is not possible due to climatic and soil conditions. The mixed system uses grazing land as well as artificial feed which is agricultural produce which is processed into animal feed. The cage system maintains livestock in full cages with feed input that must be given every day. Processing livestock manure can be a problem of air pollution because it can accumulate and release large amounts of methane gas. Industrialized countries use full-house systems to supply most of their domestic meat and livestock products. It is estimated that 75% of all increases in livestock production from 2003 to 2030 will depend on factory farming production systems.",

Some of the practices used in commercial livestock production such as the use of growth hormones are controversial in many parts of the world. Agriculture can cause problems through pesticides, nutrient flows, excess water use, loss of natural environment, and other problems. An assessment conducted in 2000 in the UK put the total external cost of addressing environmental problems related to agriculture to be \u00a32343 million, or \u00a3208 per hectare. Meanwhile in the United States, external costs for the production of agricultural crops reach US$5 to 16 billion or US$30-96 per hectare, and external costs for livestock production reach US$714 million. Both studies focus on fiscal impact, leading to the conclusion that more needs to be done to introduce external costs into agricultural enterprises. Both of them did not include subsidies in their analysis, but noted that agricultural subsidies also have an impact on society. In 2010, UNEP's International Resource Panel published a report on the environmental impact assessment of consumption and production. The study found that agriculture and food consumption are two things that put pressure on the environment, especially habitat degradation, climate change, water use, and emission of toxic substances. The UN reports that \"livestock animals are one of the main contributors to environmental problems\". 70% of the world's agricultural land is used for livestock production, directly or indirectly, as grazing land or land for producing animal feed. This amount is equivalent to 30% of the total land in the world.

Livestock is also accused of being one of the factors causing deforestation. 70% of the Amazon basin that was previously forest is now grazing land, and the rest is land for feed production. In addition to deforestation and land degradation, the cultivation of livestock which is mostly based on a single race concept is also a trigger for loss of biodiversity. The transformation of land towards its use for the production of goods and services is the most substantial way for humans to change the earth's ecosystems, and is categorized as a major driver of biodiversity loss. It is estimated that the amount of land converted by humans is between 39%-50%. Land degradation, the long-term decline in ecosystem function and productivity, is estimated to occur in 24% of the world's land. The FAO report states that land management is the main driver of degradation and 1.5 billion people depend on degraded land. Deforestation, desertification, soil erosion, loss of mineral content, and salinization are examples of forms of soil degradation. Eutrophication is an increase in the population of algae and aquatic plants in aquatic ecosystems due to the flow of nutrients from agricultural land. This can cause a loss of oxygen levels in the water when the number of dead and decaying algae and aquatic plants in the waters increases and decomposition occurs. This can cause fish destruction, loss of biodiversity, and make water unusable as drinking water and for the needs of society and industry. Excessive use of fertilizers on agricultural land followed by surface water flow can cause nutrients on agricultural land to erode and flow to nearby waters. It is these nutrients that cause eutrophication. Agriculture utilizes 70% of fresh water which is taken from various sources around the world.",

Pressure on water conservation continues to occur from the industrial sector and urban areas which continue to take water unsustainably, resulting in increased competition for water use for agriculture and challenges in producing food as well, especially in water scarce areas. Water use in agriculture can also be a cause of environmental problems, including loss of swamps, spread of waterborne diseases, and land degradation such as soil salinization when irrigation is not carried out properly. Pesticide use has increased since the 1950s, to 2.5 million tonnes per year worldwide. However, the rate of loss of agricultural production remains relatively constant. WHO estimated in 1992 that 3 million people were poisoned by pesticides each year and 200 thousand people died. Pesticides can cause pesticide resistance in pest populations so that the development of new pesticides continues. An alternative argument for this problem is that pesticides are a way to increase food production on limited land, so as to grow more agricultural crops on less land and provide more space for wildlife by preventing the expansion of agricultural land more extensively. However, criticism has developed that land expansion at the expense of the environment due to increased food demand is unavoidable, and that pesticides are simply replacing existing good agricultural practices such as crop rotation.",

Climate change affects agriculture through changes in temperature, rain (period and quantity changes), levels of carbon dioxide in the air, solar radiation, and the interactions of all these elements. Extreme events such as droughts and floods are expected to increase due to climate change. Agriculture is the sector most vulnerable to climate change. Water supply will be critical to sustain agricultural production and provide food. Fluctuations in river discharge will continue to occur due to climate change. Countries around the Nile river have experienced the impact of fluctuations in river discharge which affect seasonal agricultural output which can reduce agricultural output by up to 50%. Transformative approaches are needed to manage natural resources in the future, such as changing policies, practice methods and tools to promote climate-based agriculture and using more scientific information in analyzing risks and vulnerabilities from climate change. Agriculture can both mitigate and exacerbate global warming. Part of the increase in carbon dioxide levels in the Earth's atmosphere is due to the decomposition of organic matter in the soil, and most of the methane gas released into the atmosphere comes from agricultural activities, including the decomposition of agricultural wetlands such as rice fields, and the digestive activities of livestock. Soil that is wet and anaerobic can cause denitrification and loss of nitrogen from the soil, causing the release of nitric oxide and nitrous oxide gases into the air which are greenhouse gases.

Most of this energy input comes from fossil fuels. The Green Revolution changed agriculture around the world with a significant increase in grain production, and today modern agriculture requires the inputs of petroleum and natural gas for energy and fertilizer production. There has been concern that the scarcity of fossil energy will lead to high costs of agricultural production resulting in reduced agricultural yields and food scarcity. Industrialized countries depend on fossil fuels in two ways, namely directly consumed as a source of energy in agriculture, and indirectly as inputs for the manufacture of fertilizers and pesticides. Direct consumption may include the use of lubricants in machinery maintenance, and heat exchange fluids in heating and cooling engines. Agriculture in the United States consumed about 1.2 exajoules in 2002, which is 1% of the total energy consumed in the country. Indirect consumption, namely as the manufacture of fertilizers and pesticides that consumed fossil fuels equivalent to 0.6 exajoules in 2002. Natural gas and coal consumed through the production of nitrogen fertilizers is equivalent to half the energy needs in agriculture. China consumes coal for its nitrogen fertilizer production, while most European countries use natural gas and only a small proportion of coal. Based on a 2010 report published by The Royal Society, agriculture's dependence on fossil fuels occurs directly or indirectly. The fuel used in agriculture can vary depending on several factors such as the type of crop, production system and location.

In 2007, higher incentives for farmers growing biofuel-producing non-food crops coupled with other factors such as the reuse of less fertile idle land, increased transport costs, climate change, increasing number of consumers, and increasing world population, led to food insecurity and increase in food prices around the world.

In the scarcity of fossil fuels, organic farming will be prioritized over conventional farming which uses so many petroleum-based inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides. Various studies on modern organic farming show that the results of organic farming are as great as conventional farming. Cuba, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, experienced a scarcity of inputs of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, so that agricultural businesses in the country used organic practices and were able to feed the population. But organic farming will require more labor and hours. The shift from monoculture practices to organic farming also takes time, especially soil conditioning to remove harmful chemicals that do not comply with organic food standards.

Combining agricultural production with general theories about marketing and business is a discipline that started in the late 19th century, and continued to grow throughout the 20th century. Although the study of agriculture is relatively new, the main trends in agriculture, such as the sharing system after the United States Civil War to the feudal system that once occurred in Europe, have significantly influenced the economic activities of a country and also the world.

Both during the process and even to marketing agricultural products, digitization is so efficient. Slowly, farmers are not stuttering about digital technology, and can even increase the productivity of the agricultural sector. Of course, there are still many tasks to turn farmers into digital farmers. Government policies of a country can significantly affect the market for agricultural products, in the form of taxes, subsidies, tariffs and other duties. Since the 1960s, a combination of export-import restrictions, exchange rate policies, and subsidies has affected agriculture in both developing and developed countries. In the 1980s, farmers in developing countries who did not receive subsidies were unable to compete because policies in various countries caused low food prices. Between the 1980s and 2000s, several countries around the world made agreements to limit the tariffs, subsidies, and other trade restrictions imposed on world agriculture. However, in 2009, there were still a number of agricultural policy distortions that affected food prices.

Commercially, thallium is not produced from potassium ore, but as a by-product of refining heavy metal sulfide ores. About 65% of thallium production is used in the electronics industry, and the rest is used in the pharmaceutical industry and in the manufacture of glass. It is also used in infrared detectors.

A thallium atom has 81 electrons, arranged in the electron configuration Xe]4f145d106s26p1; In this configuration, the three outermost electrons in the sixth shell are valence electrons. As a result of the oblique pair effect, the 6s electron pair is relativistically stabilized and it is more difficult to involve it in a chemical bond than it is for heavier elements. Thus, very few electrons are available for metallic bonding, similar to neighboring elements such as mercury and lead. Thallium, like its relative, is a soft, highly electrically conducting metal with a low melting point of 304\u00b0C. A number of standard electrode potentials, depending on the reactions studied, are reported for thallium, reflecting a large decrease in the stability of the +3 oxidation state: Thallium is the first element in group 13 in which the reduction of the +3 oxidation number to +1 occurs spontaneously under standard conditions. Since the bond energies decrease down the group, with thallium, the energy released in forming two additional bonds and reaching the +3 state is not always sufficient to exceed the energy required to engage the 6s electrons. Thus, thallium(I) oxide and hydroxide are more basic and thallium(III) oxide and hydroxide more acidic, indicating that thallium conforms to the general rule that an element is more electropositive at lower oxidation states.

Controversy between the two scientists continued into 1862 and 1863. Much of this discussion ended after Crookes was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in June 1863. The predominant use of thallium was as a rodent poison. After several accidents, the use of thallium as a poison was finally banned in the United States by Presidential Executive Order 11643 in February 1972. In the following years, several other countries banned its use as well. Although thallium is a fairly abundant element in the Earth's crust, with an estimated concentration of 0.7 mg/kg, mostly associated with potassium-based minerals in clays, soils, and granite, thallium is generally not economically obtainable from these sources. The main source of thallium for practical purposes is trace amounts found in copper, lead, zinc, and other heavy metal-sulfide ores. Thallium is found in the minerals cruxite TlCu7Se4, hutcinsonite TlPbAs5S9, and lor\u00e1ndit TlAsS2. Thallium also occurs as a trace element in iron pyrite, and thallium is extracted as a byproduct of roasting this mineral for the production of sulfuric acid. Thallium can also be obtained from smelting lead and zinc ores. Manganese nodules found on the ocean floor contain some thallium, but collection of these nodules is very expensive. There is also the potential to damage the marine environment. In addition, several other thallium minerals, containing from 16% to 60% thallium, occur in nature as complex sulfides or selenides containing mainly antimony, arsenic, copper, lead, and silver. These minerals are extremely rare, and have no commercial importance as a source of thallium.",

This deposit still contains around 500\u00a0tons of thallium, and is a source for some rare thallium minerals, such as lor\u00e1ndit. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) estimates that worldwide annual production of thallium is 10 metric tons as a by-product of the smelting of copper, zinc, and lead ores. Thallium is extracted from the dust from the smelting chimney or from residues such as slag that collect at the end of the smelting process. The raw materials used for the production of thallium contain large amounts of other materials, and therefore, purification is the first step. Thallium is leached with either alkaline or sulfuric acid from the material. The thallium is precipitated from the solution several times to remove impurities. Ultimately, it is converted to thallium sulfate and the thallium is extracted by electrolysis on platinum or stainless steel plates. Production of thallium decreased by around 33% in the period 1995 to 2009 \u2013 from about 15 metric tons to around 10 tons. Because there are few small deposits or ores with relatively high thallium content, it will be possible to increase thallium production if new applications, such as thallium-containing high-temperature superconductors, become practical for widespread use outside the laboratory. Odorless and tasteless thallium sulfate was once widely used as rat poison and ant killer. Since 1972, this use has been banned in the United States due to safety concerns. Many other countries followed this example. Thallium salts are used in the treatment of ringworm, other skin infections, and to reduce night sweats in tuberculosis patients. This use has been limited due to its narrow therapeutic index, and the development of better drugs for this condition. Iodides have been used as infrared optical materials, because they are much harsher than other common infrared optics, and because they have transmission at much longer wavelengths.",

These glasses have room temperature properties similar to ordinary glasses and are durable, insoluble in water and have a unique index of refraction. The electrical conductivity of thallium(I) sulfide changes with exposure to infrared light, making this compound useful in photo resistors. Thallium selenide has been used in bolometers for infrared detection. Doping selenium semiconductors with thallium improves their performance, so they are used in small amounts in selenium rectifiers. Another application of thallium doping is in sodium iodide crystals in gamma radiation detection devices. In this case, the sodium iodide crystals are doped with a small amount of thallium to increase their efficiency as a scintillation generator. Some of the electrodes in a dissolved oxygen analyzer contain thallium. Research work with thallium is ongoing to develop high-temperature superconducting materials for applications such as magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic energy storage, magnetic propulsion, and electric power generation and transmission. Research into this application began after the discovery of the superconductor thallium barium calcium copper oxide in 1988. Thallium cuprate superconductors have also been discovered which have a transition temperature above 120 K. Some thallium cuprate superconductors doped with mercury have a transition temperature above 130 K at ambient pressure, almost as tall as the world record holder, the kuprat mercury.

The Tl+ cation will bind to the K+ pump and be transported into the cell. Exercise or dipyridamole will induce dilation (vasodilation) of the arteries in the body. This results in a coronary attack by the area where the artery is maximally dilated. The infarcted or ischemic tissue area will remain \"cold\".

This caused great upheaval in Europe as these revolutionary ideas spread across the continent. The rise of democracy caused increasing tensions in Europe in addition to the tensions that were already there because of competition in the New World. Of these, the most famous conflict was when Napoleon Bonaparte seized power, and created the French Empire which fell shortly thereafter. After these events, Europe has slowly stabilized, but the remnants of the old period concept have begun to crumble.

In flowers there are reproductive organs, namely stamens and pistils. Flowers can appear singly or together in a series. Flowers that appear together are known as compound interest or inflorescence. In some species, compound interest can be considered ordinary as a (single) flower, for example in Anthurium and sunflower. The floral units that make up compound interest are called florets. Botanically, the flower is the part of the plant that produces seeds. Pollination and fertilization take place in flowers. After fertilization, the flower will develop further to form the fruit. In flowering plants, the fruit is a structure that carries and protects the seeds. The biological function of flowers is the sexual organ, as a vessel for the union of male (microspores) and female (macrospores) gametes to produce seeds. That flowers are analogous to sexual organs in animals was only scientifically realized in the 17th century in Europe. Some flowers have bright colors that function as pollinator animal decoys. Some other flowers produce heat or a distinctive aroma, also aimed at luring animals to help pollinate. Flowers can also be considered as organs to survive in unfavorable conditions for growth. A number of plants will immediately form flowers if they experience a lack of water or low temperatures. The best known example is the Bougainvillea paper flower. Flowers reduce metabolism and if the plant dies, seeds are expected to have formed as a survival effort. Humans have long been fascinated by flowers, especially the colorful ones that have cultural significance. Flowers are one of the determinants of the value of a plant as an ornamental plant.",

Flower formation is tightly controlled genetically and in many species is induced by certain environmental changes, such as low temperature, long exposure to light, and availability of water (see section Flowers: Flower formation). Flowers are almost always symmetrical in shape, which can often be used as an identifier for a taxon. There are two flower shapes based on their shape symmetry: actinomorphic (\"star-shaped\", radial symmetry) and zygomorphic (mirror symmetry). The actinomorphic form is more common. A flower is called a perfect flower if it has male organs (stamens) and female organs (pistils) together in one organ. Such flowers are called pansy or hermaphrodite flowers. A flower is said to be a complete flower if it has all the main parts of the flower. The four main parts of a flower (from outside to inside) are as follows: The female reproductive organ is the fruit leaf or carpellum at the base of which there is an ovary (ovary) with one or a number of ovule (ovulum, plural ovules) which carry female gametes) inside embryo sac. At the tip of the pistil there is a stigma or stigma to receive pollen or pollen. The pistil or stylus serves as a pathway for the pollen to the ovary. Although the floral structure described above is said to be a \"common\" plant structure, plant species exhibit highly variable modifications. This modification is used by botanists to make connections between plants with one another.

The flower will not form before the tissue where it appears has reached maturity but is not too old (senile). In tree-shaped plants, it is very difficult for newly formed or still developing (juvenile) tissues to form flowers. Tissues that reach maturity are often characterized by a high carbon-nitrogen ratio (C-N ratio). High carbon content because many metabolites have accumulated in the form of polysaccharides in the network. The formation of flowers requires a lot of energy. A high C-N ratio is usually sufficient to encourage interest formation. However, there are many types of plants that require triggers for flowers to appear. These triggers can be low temperatures for some time (vernalization), long (duration) exposure (photoperiodism), and lack of water (drought). Winter type bread wheat (winter, because it is planted before winter) will not flower if it is not overwintered in its growth and development stage. The dove orchid blooms on a cold night. Various cultivars of jute are photoperiodic, so planting time is vital in determining yields. Coffee plants are known to require a dry period of around two months followed by just enough rain to trigger flower formation. A study conducted on Arabidopsis thaliana, a model plant, shows how the ABC Theory works in flower formation. Substance A is needed to form the sepals and petals. Substance B is required in the formation of the corolla and stamens. Substance C is needed for the formation of stamens and carpellum, as a constituent of pistils.

Many crustaceans are known by the name \"shrimp\".

Triops longicaudatus and Triops cancriformis are also popular freshwater animals, and are often called prawns, although they belong to the Notostraca, an unrelated group. Shrimp mature and spawn only in marine water habitats. The female is capable of laying 50,000 to 1 million eggs, which hatch after 24 hours into larvae (nauplius). Nauplius then metamorphoses into the second phase, namely zoea (plural zoeae). Zoea eats wild algae. After a few days it metamorphosed again into mysis (plural myses). Mysis feed on algae and zooplankton. After three to four days later they metamorphose for the last time entering the postlarvae stage: young shrimp that already have the characteristics of adult animals. The whole process takes about 12 days from the time it first hatches. At this stage, cultivated shrimp are ready to be traded, and are referred to as fry. In the wild, postlarvae then migrate to estuaries, which are very rich in nutrients and low in salinity. There they grow and sometimes migrate again to open water where they mature. Adult shrimp are benthic animals that mainly live on the seabed, shrimp are still distant relatives of insects such as caterpillars, butterflies, geese and so on.

This process begins with hormonal signals from the brain to the gonads: ovaries in girls, testes in boys. In response to these signals, the gonads produce hormones that stimulate libido and the growth, function, and transformation of the brain, bones, muscles, blood, skin, hair, breasts, and sex organs. Physical growth (height and weight) increases in the first half of puberty and is complete when the adult body has developed. Before puberty, external sex organs known as primary sexual characteristics are sex characteristics that distinguish males and females. Puberty leads to sexual dimorphism through the development of secondary sex characteristics, which further differentiate the sexes. On average, girls start puberty at ages 10-11 and end at ages 15-17; boys generally begin puberty at ages 11-12 and end at ages 16-17.

In the 21st century, the average age of puberty for children, especially girls, was lower than in the 19th century, namely 15 years for girls and 16 years for boys.

Adolescence is a time of mental transition from childhood to adulthood, which overlaps most of the physical period of puberty. The two most significant differences between puberty in girls and puberty in boys are the age at which it starts, and the main sex steroids that affect it, androgens and estrogens. Although there are various normal age ranges, girls usually begin puberty around ages 10\u201311 and end puberty around 15\u201317; boys start around ages 11-12 and end around 16-17. Girls reach reproductive maturity about four years after the first physical changes appear. Boys, on the other hand, are slower, but continue to grow for about six years after the first noticeable pubertal changes. Any increase in height beyond the age of post puberty is rare. In boys, the androgen testosterone is the main sex hormone; while testosterone is produced, all male changes are characterized as virilization. A substantial product of testosterone metabolism in men is estradiol.

There are also older references that this fiber-deoxyribonucleic acid and protein complex found at interphase of eukaryotic cells is built from nucleosomes and consists of histone octamers associated with about 200 base pairs of deoxyribonucleic acid. Then to the nucleosome core elements associated with histone H1 protein and 20 deoxyribonucleic acid base pairs, which are 10 bp each downstream and upstream of deoxyribonucleic acid nucleosome core elements. One whole nucleosome associates 166 bp of DNA with 5 types of histone proteins. Deoxyribonucleic acid is a genetic material whose proof was first carried out by Frederick Griffith in 1928, namely by transforming the Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria. This genetic material in eukaryotes is found not only in the cell nucleus but also in other organelles, such as mitochondria and chloroplasts. Prokaryotes such as bacteria generally have a single circular chromosome although there are some bacteria that have an additional deoxyribonucleic acid molecule in the form of a plasmid. Chromosomal proteins that bind DNA are simply divided into two main classes: histone and non-histone chromosomal proteins. Histones are proteins that consist of five subunits, namely histones H1, H2A, H2B, H3 and H4.",

It should also be noted that in Scottish Gaelic (another language that developed on the Isle of Britain), the name for the Saxons is \"Sasunn\", suggesting that this word was coined by the Saxons. An alternative name for England is Albion. The word was originally used to refer to the whole of the Island of Great Britain.

The oldest proto-human skeleton found in England is thought to date back 500,000 years. Modern humans are known to have inhabited Britain in the Upper Paleolithic period, although permanent settlements were only formed in the last 6000 years. After the end of the ice age period, only large mammals such as mammoths, ancient bison and rhinoceros inhabited this region. About 11,000 years ago, as the ice sheets began to recede, humans again settled in England. Genetic studies show that they came from the northern part of the Iberian Peninsula. The sea level had been lower than currently, The united kingdom ended up being attached just as well as the islands of Ireland and Eurasia. But as sea levels rose, Britain separated from Ireland 10,000 years ago, and then from Eurasia two millennia later. Beaker culture entered Britain around 2500 BC. This culture introduced food and drink utensils made of clay and copper. This period was also the period when Neolithic monuments such as Stonehenge and Avebury were built. Using the technique of heating tin and copper, which were abundant in the region, the Beakers began to manufacture bronze, and later produce iron from iron ore. The development of iron smelting techniques led to the creation of plow engines, which ultimately led to more advanced agriculture and the production of more effective weapons. According to John T.

In these areas, the primary authority lies with the subdivisional councils, namely the metropolitan boroughs. In the rest of the region, the 27 non-metropolitan \"shire\" counties have county councils and are divided into districts, each of which also has a District Council. These counties are usually (though not always) located in rural areas. The remaining non-metropolitan counties consist of a single district and are usually a small town or county with a sparse population; these counties are known as unitary authorities. Greater London has a distinct system of local government; with the 32 boroughs of London, plus the City of London which includes a small area in central London and is governed by the City of London Corporation. At the lowest level of local government, England is divided into civil parishes, each of which has its own parish council. These parishes do not exist in Greater London. England's national flag is known as the St. George Cross and has been the national flag since the 13th century. Actually, the flag is used by the maritime territory of the Republic of Genoa. The English Empire paid tribute to the Government of Genoa from 1190, so that English ships could use the flag as a symbol of protection when crossing the Mediterranean. The red cross was a symbol for the Crusades in the 12th and 13th centuries.",

There are a number of other official and unofficial symbols and symbolic artefacts, including the Tudor rose, the national identity flora, the white dragon , and the three lions that feature on England's national coat of arms. The Tudor rose was adopted as the national emblem of England during the Wars of the Roses as a symbol of peace. This symbol is a syncretic symbol combining a white rose, representing the House of York, and a red rose, representing the House of Lancaster (the successor to the House of Plantagenet). This symbol is also known as the \"Rose of England\". The oak tree is also designated as the national symbol of England, representing strength and endurance. The term \"Royal Oak\" refers to King Charles II's attempt to escape from the clutches of MPs after his father was executed. It is said that he hid in an oak tree to avoid capture. The National Coat of Arms of England featuring three lions was decreed by King Richard the Lionheart in 1198. England does not have an official national anthem. As part of the United Kingdom, the de facto national anthem is God Save the Queen. However, the songs Jerusalem, I Vow to Thee, My Country and Land of Hope and Glory are often considered Britain's unofficial national anthems. The anthems were sung at the 2002 Commonwealth Games.

These genres have their own variations that differ according to regional peculiarities. Wynkyn de Worde created ballads of Robin Hood in the 16th century and are important artefacts, as are John Playford's The Dancing Master and Robert Harley's Roxburghe Ballads collections. Some of the famous folk songs are The Good Old Way, Pastime with Good Company, Maggie May, and Spanish Ladies. Many of the poems are of English origin, including Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, Roses are red, Jack and Jill, Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush, and Humpty Dumpty.

The term communism is often confused with International Communism. Communism or Marxism is the basic ideology commonly used by communist parties around the world. Meanwhile, international communism is an ideological blend originating from Lenin's thoughts, so it can also be called \"Marxism\u2013Leninism\". In communism, social change must start from taking over the means of production through the role of the communist party. In summary, the logic is that social change begins with the workers, or better known as the proletariat (see: The Holy Family), but the organization of workers can only succeed through party struggle. The party needs the role of the Politburo as a think-tank. It can be summarized that social change can only be successful if it is initiated by the Politburo. Communism as anti-capitalism uses the communist party system as a means of taking over power and strongly opposes the ownership of accumulated capital in individuals. In principle, everything is represented as belonging to the people and therefore, all means of production must be controlled by the state for the people's prosperity evenly. Communism introduces the use of a representative democratic system carried out by communist party elites. Therefore it greatly limits direct democracy to people who are not members of the communist party. Therefore, in communism, individual rights are not recognized as found in liberalism. International communism as an ideological theory began to be applied after the outbreak of the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia on November 7, 1917. Since then communism has been applied as an ideology and spread to other countries. In 2005, countries that still adhered to communism were China, Vietnam, North Korea, Cuba and Laos.",

Placozoa were first discovered in 1883 by the German zoologist Franz Eilhard Schulze (1840-1921) and since the 1970s have been more systematically analyzed by Karl Gottlieb Grell (1912-1994). However, this taxon does not yet have a common name (for example Porifera which has the common name sponge); its own scientific name literally means \"flat animal\". Placozoa has only one member, Trichoplax which is a small, flat-shaped animal about 1 mm in diameter. Like Amoeba, this animal has no clear shape, the lower surface is slightly concave, and the top is flat. The body consists of an outer layer of simple epithelium covering sheets of stellate cells that resemble more complex animal mesenchyme. Its epithelial cells have a flagellum, which it uses to crawl across the ocean floor. Its lower surface engulfs small organic particles as food. These animals reproduce asexually by budding. There is no convincing fossil record of placozoa, the organism that appears to be related to this phylum is Dickinsonia from the Precambrian period 550 million years ago. Scientists classify animals based on organizational levels such as the presence of tissues and organs that only higher animals have, so Placozoa that do not have any of the above are considered the most basal animals (or the most basic in the phylogenetic tree). However, the absence of tissues or organs could be because these features were lost in later generations (another example of chondrostei such as sturgeon fish consists of mostly cartilage, but scientists include them in the group of bony fish, because they are closer in kinship than bony fish cartilaginous species such as rays and sharks; sturgeon fish lost most of the process of ossification/ossification of their ancestors), so a classification based on the absence of tissue or organs cannot be used as a clade.",

Other theories suggest that Chile got its name from an American Indian word meaning \"end of the world\" or \"seagull;\" or \"Earth's deepest point.\" The Spanish conquistadors heard about this name from the Incas, and the few survivors of Diego de Almagro's first Spanish expedition south from Peru in 1535\u201336 called themselves the \"men of Chilli.\" Almagro is credited with the universalization of the name Chile, after naming the Mapocho valley as such.",

Bounded on the north by desert, on the south by the Mapuche, on the east by the Andes Mountains, and on the west by the ocean, Chile became one of the most centralized, homogeneous colonies in Spanish America. Due to its remote position from the centers of the great empire and trade routes, as well as its conflict with the Mapuche, Chile was a poor province belonging to the wealthy Viceroyalty of Peru, whose economy served only to support its raw material needs\u2014such as hides, tallow, and wheat\u2014 the viceroyalty and little territory of Spanish Chile. Acting as a garrison outpost, the colony served as a deterrent to encroachment by the Mapuche people and Spain's European enemies, especially the British and the Dutch.

In the north of the country, many rivers are found which are important for agricultural valleys, which are quite prominent are the Elqui River with a length of 75\u00a0km, the Akonkagua River with a length of 142\u00a0km, the Maipo River with a length of 250\u00a0 and its tributaries, the Mapocho River with a length of 110\u00a0km, and the Maule River for 240 km. Their source of flow is mainly Andean snowmelt in summer and rain in winter. Almost all areas do not have lakes that have important value, except for the artificial lakes of Rapel, Colb\u00fan, Laguna del Maule, and Laguna de La Laja. To the south, the Biob\u00edo River is 380 km long, crossing hundreds of villages along its watershed and being the source of the hydroelectric power plants that supply electricity to much of the country's population.",

Several lakes are important to the Seven Lakes system, namely Lake Ranco, Lake Puyehue, Lake Rupanco, Lake Todos Los Santos, and Lake Llanquihue, the second largest. In the Patagonia region, the rivers are relatively smaller but with fast water rates, such as the Futaleuf\u00fa River, the Palena River, 240 km long, the Baker River, 370 km long, and the Pascua River, 62 km long, while the lakes other than Presidente Lake R\u00edos on the Taitao Peninsula and the San Rafael Lagoon, located near the international border with Argentina, share ownership between the two countries.

Chile's climate consists of a wide variety of weather conditions on a wide geographic scale, across the 38 degrees south latitude, making predictions difficult. According to the K\u00f6ppen system, Chile has at least seven main climatic subtypes within its borders, ranging from desert in the north, to alpine tundra and glaciers (river ice) in the east and southeast, humid subtropical on Easter Island, oceanic climate in the south and Mediterranean climate in central Chile. There are four seasons in most parts of the country: summer (December to February), autumn (March to May), winter (June to August), and spring (September to November).

In the natural region of Norte Grande, the climate is desert, with minimal rainfall. Temperatures vary slightly throughout the year, maintaining an average of 20\u00b0C. The Humboldt Current stabilizes and cools the coastal areas and allows for the abundant cloudy cloud known as the camanchaca. Inland, the atmospheric temperature range is high, dry and cloudless, making it an ideal area for building large observatories. In the altiplano (upland) zone, temperatures drop due to altitude creating a cool prairie climate characterized by abundant rainfall in summer, known as the Andean winter. In the Norte Chico zone, there is a warm or semiarid prairie climate that acts as a transition to the cooler climates to the south. Precipitation is not very regular and concentrated in temporal intervals. From the valley of the Aconcagua to the south, the predominant climate is the Mediterranean climate, except for the tops of the Andean Range, where the climate is affected by altitude. The four seasons are distinctly distinct, with hot, dry summers and cold, rainy winters. The coastal zone is affected by temperature fluctuations in the eastern Pacific Ocean. Whereas the inland zone has a high range of atmospheric temperatures, where the Coastal Range acts as a screen climate. In Santiago, summer temperatures average 20\u00b0C (January) with an extreme of 36\u00b0C, while winter temperatures average 8\u00b0C (June) with extremes of -2\u00b0C, with 2005 and 2007 being the snowiest years .

Easter Island has a subtropical climate, with an average annual rainfall of 1138 mm. Chile's climate and relief (topography) influence the development of life and the formation of the country's diverse ecosystems. Chile's geographical isolation has also limited animal immigration, so that only a few of the many animals typical of South America are found. Among the large mammals are the puma or cougar, the llama-like guanako and the fox-like chilla. In forest areas, several types of marsupials and small deer known as pudu can be found. There are many species of small birds, but most of the larger Latin American common species are absent. Being in the vicinity of the Humboldt Current, the ocean waters abound with fish and other forms of marine life, which in turn support the existence of a wide variety of waterfowl, including some penguins. Whales are abundant, and about six species of seals are found in this area. Approximately 3,000 species of fungi have been recorded in Chile, but this figure is incomplete. The actual total number of fungal species present in Chile is possibly much higher, the generally accepted estimate being that only about 7% of all fungal species worldwide have been discovered. Although the amount of information available is still very small, a preliminary attempt was made to estimate the number of fungal species endemic to Chile, and 1995 species have been provisionally identified as possibly endemic to this country.",

Real GDP growth averaged 8% in the period 1991\u20131997, but halved in 1998 due to tightening monetary policy (implemented to keep the current account deficit in check) and due to reduced export earnings, written later as the result of the crisis Asian finance. The Chilean economy is recovering and experiencing growth rates of 5\u20137% in recent years. After a decade of impressive growth rates, Chile began to experience a moderate economic slowdown in 1999, affected by unfavorable global economic conditions related to the Asian financial crisis, which began in 1997.",

The unemployment rate hovered around 8%\u201310% after the start of the economic slowdown in 1999, above the average of 7% in the 1990s. The unemployment rate finally decreased to 7.8% in 2006, and continued to fall in 2007, at an average of 6.8% per month (until August). Wages are rising faster than inflation as a result of higher productivity, pushing up national living standards. The percentage of Chileans with a per capita head of household income below the poverty line\u2014defined as twice the cost of meeting the nutritional needs of at least one person\u2014decreased from 45.1% in 1987 to 11.5% in 2009, according to a government investigation. However, critics in Chile argue that the true poverty figure is actually higher than the officially published one. (The government established the poverty line based on the household consumption investigations in 1987 which were certainly stale, and did not use the investigations from 1997 or 2007). According to these critics, using data from the 1997 inquiry would have increased the poverty rate by 29%. Using the relative advantage of many European countries, 27% of Chileans would be poor, according to Juan Carlos Feres of ECLAC. High domestic rates of investment and saving helped propel the Chilean economy to an average growth rate of 8% in the 1990s. The privatized national pension system (AFP) has encouraged domestic investment and contributed to a total domestic saving rate of approximately 21% of GDP.",

Sound economic policies, maintained consistently since the 1980s, have contributed to tremendous economic growth in Chile and have more than half the poverty rate. The 1973\u20131990 military government sold off many state-owned enterprises, and the three democratic governments since 1990 have continued privatization, albeit at a slower pace. The government's role in the economy was primarily limited to regulation, although the state continued to operate the giant copper company CODELCO and several others (three of which were state-owned banks). Chile is deeply committed to free trade and has opened its doors to massive foreign investment. Chile signed several free trade agreements (FTAs) with a wide web of countries, including the FTA with the United States signed in 2003 and implemented in January 2004. Chile's independent central bank follows an inflation target of 2% to 4%. Inflation has not exceeded 5% since 1998. Chile posted an inflation rate of 3.2% in 2006.

Chile's approach to foreign direct investment is codified in the Foreign Investment Act, which treats foreign investors the same as Chilean citizens. Registration is reportedly quite simple and transparent, and foreign investors are guaranteed access to the legal foreign exchange market to repatriate their profits and capital. Experience with the international economic downturn led the government to announce a $4 billion economic stimulus plan to boost labor volumes and growth, and despite the global financial crisis, aim to expand GDP by two or three percent by 2009. Economic analysts nonetheless disagree with the government's estimates and predictions of economic growth at a median of 1.5 percent.

In 1907, it was inhabited by 383,587 inhabitants, increasing to 549,292 in 1920, when it represents 16% of the national population; however, in the following years, a population explosion caused cities to expand into the surrounding countryside to absorb former villagers, for example Puente Alto and Maip\u00fa, two of the most populous communes in Chile.",

This accent differs quite a bit between the south and north; more noticeable are the small differences in accent based on social class or whether one lives in the city or the country. The Chilean population broadly formed in small parts of the center of the country and then migrated partly to the north and south.

It is characterized by the rigidity of its structure and its resistance to changes in shape or volume. Unlike liquids, solid objects do not flow to take on the shape of their container, nor do they expand to fill their full fillable volume like gases. The atoms in a solid are tightly bound to each other, in either a regular (crystalline solids, which include metals and ice) or irregular (amorphous solids such as window glass in general) geometries. The branch of physics dealing with solids is called solid-state physics, and is the main branch of condensed matter physics (which also includes liquids). The primary concern of materials science is the physical and chemical properties of solids. Solid state chemistry focuses on the synthesis of new materials, as well as analysis and chemical composition. The atoms, molecules or ions that make up a solid may be arranged in a regular, or irregular, repeating pattern. Materials whose constituents are arranged in a regular pattern are known as crystals. In some cases, the ordered arrangement can continue unbroken on a large scale, such as diamond, where each diamond is a single crystal. Solid objects large enough to see and handle are rarely composed of a single crystal, but are made of a large number of single crystals, known as crystallites, which vary in size from a few nanometers to several meters. Such materials are called polycrystalline. Almost all common metals, and many ceramics, are polycrystalline. In other materials, there is no order of position of the remote atoms. These solids are known as amorphous solids; Examples include polystyrene and glass. Solids, whether crystalline or amorphous, depend on the materials involved, and the conditions in which they were formed.",

        "paragraph": "Solids that form by slow cooling tend to form crystals, while solids that cool quickly are more likely to be amorphous. Likewise, the specific crystal structure adopted by a crystalline solid depends on the materials involved and the way they were formed. While many objects, such as ice cubes or coins, are chemically identical as a whole, many common materials consist of a number of different substances packaged together. For example, a common rock is an aggregate of several different minerals and mineraloids, without a specific chemical composition. Wood is a natural organic material whose main component is cellulose fibers embedded in an organic lignin matrix. In materials science, a composite of more than one material constituent can be designed to have the desired properties. Forces between atoms in solids can take various forms. For example, crystals of sodium chloride (common salt) are composed of sodium and chlorine ions, which are held together by ionic bonds. In diamond or silicon, the atoms share electrons and form covalent bonds. In metals, electrons are shared in metallic bonds. Some solids, especially organic compounds, are held together by van der Waals forces that result from the polarization of the charge of the electron cloud on individual molecules. The differences between the types of solids are a result of the differences in their bonds. Metals are usually strong, dense, and good conductors of electricity and heat. Most of the elements in the periodic table, namely those to the left of the virtual boron\u2013polonium diagonal line, are metals. A mixture of two or more elements whose main component is a metal is known as an alloy. Humans have used metals for a variety of purposes since prehistoric times. The strength and reliability of metals have led to their widespread use in the construction of buildings and other structures, as well as in most vehicles, many furniture and fittings, pipes, traffic signs, and railroads.",

Iron is most widely used in the form of an alloy, steel, which contains up to 2.1% carbon, making it much harder than pure iron. Because metals are good conductors of electricity, they are useful in electrical equipment and for carrying electric current over long distances with little loss or energy dissipation. Thus, the power grid relies on metal wires to distribute electricity. Residential electrical systems, for example, use bronze wires because of their good conductivity and ease of fabrication. The high thermal conductivity of most metals makes them useful for cooking stove tops. The study of metallic elements and their alloys is a significant part of the fields of solid state chemistry, physics, materials science, and engineering. Metallic solids are held together by high-density delocalized electrons, known as \"metallic bonds\". In a metal, atoms easily lose their outermost (\"valence\") electrons, forming positive ions. Free electrons travel throughout the solid, which is held together tightly by electrostatic interactions between the ions and the electron cloud. The massive number of free electrons gives metals high electrical and thermal conductivity. Free electrons also prevent the transmission of visible light, making metals opaque, shiny, and lustrous. A further model of metallic properties considers the effect of positive ion nuclei on delocalized electrons. Since most metals have a crystal structure, the ions are usually arranged in a periodic lattice. Mathematically, the ionic nuclear potential can be treated by various models, the simplest of which is the nearly free electron model. Minerals are naturally occurring solids that are formed through various geological processes under high pressure.",

The mineral composition ranges from the pure elements and simple salts to very complex silicates which are known to exist in thousands of forms. In contrast, rock samples are random aggregates of minerals and/or mineraloids, and do not have a specific chemical composition. Most of the rocks of the earth's crust consist of quartz (SiO2 crystals), feldspar, mica, chlorite, kaolin, calcite, epidote, olivine, augite, hornblende, magnetite, hematite, limonite and several other minerals. Some minerals, such as quartz, mica or feldspar are plural, while others are only found in a few locations around the world. By far the largest group of minerals are silicates (most rocks are \u226595% silicates), which are composed mostly of silicon and oxygen, with the addition of aluminum, magnesium, iron, calcium and other metal ions. Ceramic solids consist of inorganic compounds, usually the oxides of the chemical elements. They are chemically inert, and are often capable of resisting the chemical erosion that occurs in both acidic and alkaline environments. Ceramics can generally withstand high temperatures between 1000\u20131600\u00b0C (1830\u20132910\u00b0F) (1800 to 3000 & nbsp;\u00b0F). Exceptions include non-oxidizing inorganic materials, such as nitrides, borides and carbides. Traditional ceramic raw materials include clay minerals such as kaolinite, newer materials include aluminum oxide (alumina). Modern ceramic materials, which are classified as advanced ceramics, include silicon carbide and tungsten carbide. Both are valued for their abrasion resistance, and as such, find use in applications as crusher equipment cover plates in mining operations. Most ceramic materials, such as alumina and its compounds, are formed from fine powders, resulting in a fine-grained polycrystalline microstructure filled with light-scattering centers comparable to the wavelength of visible light.",

Recent nano (eg sol-gel) technologies, however, allow the production of polycrystalline transparent ceramics such as transparent alumina and alumina compounds for applications such as high-energy lasers. More advanced ceramics are also used in the pharmaceutical, electrical and electronics industries. Ceramic engineering is the science and technology of creating solid ceramic materials, parts and tools. This is done through the action of heat, as well as at lower temperatures, using precipitation reactions from chemical solutions. This term includes the purification of raw materials, the study and production of the chemical compounds concerned, their formation into components, and the study of their structure, composition and properties. Mechanically, ceramic materials are brittle, hard, strong in compression but weak in shear and tension. Brittle materials can exhibit significant tensile strength by supporting static loads.\u00a0en] toughness indicates the amount of energy a material can absorb before mechanical failure, whereas fracture toughness\u00a0en] (denoted KIc) describes the ability of a material with inherent microstructural weaknesses to resist fracture through crack growth and propagation. If the material has a large fracture toughness value, the basic principles of fracture mechanics indicate that it will most likely experience elastic fracture. Brittle fracture is so characteristic of most ceramic and glass-ceramic materials that it usually exhibits low (and inconsistent) KIc values. As an example of ceramic applications, zirconia, which has extreme hardness, is used in the manufacture of knives and other industrial cutting tools. Ceramics such as alumina, boron carbide and silicon carbide have been used in bulletproof vests to repel large caliber rifle shots.

The ceramic engine does not require a cooling system allowing for a large reduction in weight and therefore more fuel efficiency. In conventional metal engines, most of the energy released from the fuel must be dissipated as waste heat\u00a0en] to prevent melting of metal parts. Research is also being carried out in developing ceramic parts for gas turbine engines. Turbine engines made of ceramic can operate more efficiently, resulting in greater range and payload of aircraft for a given amount of fuel. However, such machines are not produced due to the difficulty and high cost of manufacturing ceramic parts in sufficient precision and durability. Processing methods often produce microscopic defects which often have a detrimental role in the sintering process, resulting in crack proliferation, and finally mechanical failure. Glass ceramic materials share many of the properties of both non-crystalline glass and crystalline ceramics. They form as glass, and then partially crystallize through heating, producing a crystalline and amorphous phase such that the crystalline seeds are trapped between the non-crystalline intergranular phases. Glass ceramic is used to make cookware (originally known under the brand name CorningWare) and stove tops which have a high resistance to thermal shock and low liquid permeability. The negative coefficient of thermal expansion of the crystalline ceramic phase can be balanced by the positive coefficient of the glass phase.",

Glass ceramics can also occur naturally when lightning strikes crystalline seeds (eg quartz) which are common in most beach sands. In this case, the extreme and rapid heating from lightning (~2500\u00b0C) creates hollow, branching, root-like structures, called fulgurites through melting. Organic chemistry studies the structure, properties, composition, reactions and preparation by synthesis (or other means) of carbon and hydrogen chemical compounds, which can contain a number of other chemical elements such as nitrogen, oxygen and the halogens: fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine. Some organic compounds may contain the element phosphorus or sulfur. Examples of organic solids include wood, paraffin, naphthalene and various polymers and plastics. Wood is a natural organic material whose main content is cellulose fibers embedded in a lignin matrix. According to its mechanical properties, the fiber has compressive strength, and the lignin matrix is \u200b\u200bresistant to compression. Therefore, wood has been an important construction material since humans built huts and used boats. The wood used for construction work is commonly known as logs. In construction, wood is not only a structural material, but is also used to form concrete forms. Wood-based materials are also widely used for packaging (eg cardboard) and paper, both of which are made from pulp. The chemical pulping process uses a combination of high temperatures and alkaline (kraft) or acidic (sulfite) chemicals to break the chemical bonds of lignin before being fired. One of the important properties of carbon in organic chemistry is that it can form certain compounds, the individual molecules of which are able to attach to each other, thus forming chains or networks.",

Monomers can have various chemical substituents, or functional groups, which can affect the chemical properties of organic compounds, such as solubility and chemical reactivity, as well as physical properties, such as hardness, density, mechanical or tensile strength, abrasion resistance, heat resistance, transparency, color, etc. . In proteins, this difference gives polymers the ability to assume a biologically active conformation in preference to other proteins (see self-assembly en]). People have used natural organic polymers for centuries in the form of waxes and gum lacquers which are classified as thermoplastic polymers. A plant polymer called cellulose provides tensile strength to natural fibers and ropes, and in the early 19th century, natural rubber was widely used. Polymers are the raw materials (resins) used to make what are often called plastics. Plastics are end products, made after one or more polymers or additives have been added to a resin during processing, which are then shaped into a final shape. Polymers in circulation, and those currently in widespread use, include those based on carbon: polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene, nylon, polyester, acrylic, polyurethane, and polycarbonate, and those based on silicon: silicone. Plastics are generally classified as \"commodity\", \"specialty\" and \"engineering\" plastics. Composite materials contain two or more macroscopic phases, which are often ceramic. For example, the continuous matrix, and the dispersed phase are ceramic particles or fibers. Applications of composite materials range from structural elements such as steel-reinforced concrete, to thermal insulation tiles which play a key and integral role in NASA's space shuttle heat protection system used to protect the spacecraft surface from heat upon re-entering the Earth's atmosphere.",

RCC is a laminated composite material made of graphite rayon fabric and impregnated with phenol formaldehyde resin. After being cured at high temperature in an autoclave, the laminate is pyrolyzed to convert the resin to carbon, impregnated with furfural alcohol under vacuum, and recovered/pyrolyzed to convert the furfural alcohol to carbon. To provide oxidation resistance for reuse capability, the RCC outer layer is converted to silicon carbide. Domestic examples of composites can be seen in the \"plastic\" casings of television sets, cell phones and so on. These plastic sheaths typically consist of a composite consisting of a thermoplastic matrix such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) to which calcium carbonate lime, talc, glass fiber or carbon fiber have been added for strength, bulk, or electro-static dispersion. These additions may be referred to as reinforcing fibers, or dispersants, depending on their purpose. Thus, the matrix material surrounds and supports the reinforcement material while maintaining its relative position. Reinforcement imparts special mechanical and physical properties to enhance matrix properties. The synergism results in material properties not available in the individual constituents, while the wide range of matrix and reinforcement materials provides the designer with a choice of optimal combinations. A semiconductor is a material that has an electrical resistance (and conductivity) between that of metallic conductors and non-metallic insulators.

Common semiconductor materials include silicon, germanium and gallium arsenide. Many traditional solids exhibit different properties when they are reduced to nanometer sizes. For example, gold, which is usually yellow, and silicon, which is usually gray, becomes red; gold nanoparticles melt at a much lower temperature (~300\u00b0C at 2.5nm in size) than gold plates (1064\u00b0C); and the metallic nanowires are much stronger than their bulk metals. The large surface area of \u200b\u200bnanoparticles makes them very attractive for certain applications in the energy field. For example, platinum metal can provide improvements as an automotive fuel catalyst, as well as a fuel cell proton exchange membrane (PEM).

Their defining characteristics include structural hierarchy, multifunctionality and self-healing abilities. Self-organization is also a fundamental feature of many biological materials and a mode of structural formation from the molecular level. Thus, self-assembling\u00a0en] emerges as a new strategy in the chemical synthesis of high-performance biomaterials. The physical properties of elements and compounds that provide conclusive evidence of chemical composition include odor, color, volume, density (mass per unit volume), melting point, boiling point, heat capacity, physical form and state at room temperature (solid, liquid or gas, cubic , trigonal crystals, etc. ), hardness, porosity, refractive index and many others. This section discusses some of the physical properties of materials in the solid state. The mechanical properties of materials describe characteristics such as strength and their resistance to deformation. For example, steel beams are used in construction because of their high strength, which means that they do not break or bend significantly under applied loads. Mechanical properties include elasticity and plasticity, tensile strength, compressive strength, shear strength, fracture resistance en], ductility (low for brittle materials), and indentation hardness. Solid mechanics is the study of the behavior of solids under external actions such as external forces and changes in temperature. Solids do not show macroscopic flow, like fluids. Any degree of deviation from the original shape is called deformation. The proportion of the deformation to its original size is called the strain. If a sufficiently low stress (stress) is applied, nearly all solid materials behave in such a way that strain is directly proportional to stress (Hooke's law).",

Materials that can retain their strength at high temperatures, called refractories, are useful for many purposes. For example, glass ceramics have been extensively used for cooktops, as they exhibit excellent mechanical properties and can withstand rapid and repeated temperature changes of up to 1000\u00b0C. In the aerospace industry, high performance materials used in the exterior design of aircraft and/or spacecraft must be resistant to thermal shock. Therefore, fibers are replacing organic polymers and polymer/ceramic/metal composite materials as well as fiber-reinforced polymers are currently being designed with this aim in mind. Because solids have thermal energy, their atoms vibrate around fixed positions in an ordered (or disordered) lattice. The spectrum of lattice vibrations in a crystal or glass network provides the basis for the kinetic theory of solids. This motion occurs at the atomic level, so it cannot be observed or detected without proper equipment, such as that used in spectroscopy. The thermal properties of solids include thermal conductivity, which is a material property that indicates its ability to conduct heat. Solids also have a specific heat capacity, which is the capacity of a material to store energy in the form of heat (or thermal lattice vibration). Electrical properties include conductivity, resistance, impedance and capacitance. Electrical conductors such as metals and alloys have the opposite properties of electrical insulators such as glass and ceramics. Semiconductors behave somewhere in between.

Many materials also exhibit superconductivity at low temperatures; they include elemental metals such as tin and aluminum, various metal alloys, some doped semiconductors, and certain ceramics. The electrical resistivity of most electrical (metal) conductors generally decreases gradually with decreasing temperature, but remains limited. But in superconductors, the electrical resistance drops to zero when the material is cooled below its critical temperature. Electric current flowing in a loop of superconducting wires can occur infinitely without a power source. A dielectric, or electrical insulator, is a substance that is highly resistant to the flow of electric current. Dielectrics, such as plastics, tend to concentrate the applied electric field within themselves which is a property used in capacitors. A capacitor is an electrical device that can store energy in an electric field between pairs of closely spaced conductors (called 'plates'). When a voltage is applied to the capacitor, an electric charge that is equal in magnitude, but opposite in polarity, is loaded on the individual plates. Capacitors are used in electrical circuits as energy storage devices, as well as electronic filters to distinguish between high frequency and low frequency signals. Piezoelectricity\u00a0en] is the ability of a crystal to generate an electric voltage in response to an applied mechanical stress. The piezoelectric effect is reversible in a piezoelectric crystal, when subjected to an external voltage, it can deform in a small amount. Polymer materials such as rubber, wool, hair, wood fibers, and silk often behave like electret. For example, the polymer polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) exhibits a piezoelectric response many times greater than that of the traditional piezoelectric material quartz (SiO2 crystal).

For some purposes, the optical and mechanical properties of a material are of interest.

While sapphire's strength is superior at room temperature to other available mid-infrared dome materials, sapphire's strength weakens above 600\u00b0C. There has long been a compromise between optical transparency and mechanical durability; New materials such as transparent ceramics or optical nanocomposites can improve performance. Waveguide transmission of light involves the field of optical fiber and the ability of certain glass to transmit, together with low loss, a range of frequencies (multimode optical guidance waves) with little interference in between. Waveguided optics are used as components in integrated optical circuits or as transmission media in optical communication systems. Solar cells or photovoltaic cells are devices that convert light energy into electrical energy.

Although all isotopes of a given element have nearly the same chemical properties, they have different atomic masses and physical properties. The term isotope is formed from the Greek roots isos (\u1f34\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2 \"same\") and topos (\u03c4\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 \"place\"), meaning \"same place\"; thus, the meaning behind the name is that the different isotopes of an element occupy the same position on the periodic table. The term was coined by the Scottish physician and writer Margaret Todd in 1913 in a suggestion to the English chemist Frederick Soddy. The number of protons in the atomic nucleus is called the atomic number and is equal to the number of electrons in a neutral (non-ionized) atom. Each atomic number identifies a particular element, but not its isotope; an atom of a given element may have a wide range of number of neutrons. The number of nucleons (protons and neutrons) in the nucleus is the atomic mass number, and each isotope of a given element has a different mass number. For example, carbon-12, carbon-13, and carbon-14 are three isotopes of the element carbon with mass numbers 12, 13, and 14 respectively. Carbon's atomic number is 6, which means that each carbon atom has 6 protons, so the number The number of neutrons for these isotopes is 6, 7, and 8, respectively.

Even for the lightest elements, in which the ratio of neutron number to atomic number varies the most between isotopes, it usually has only a small effect even in some circumstances (for hydrogen, the lightest element, the isotopic effect is large enough to affect its biology strongly). The term isotope (originally also elemental isotope, now sometimes nuclide isotope) is meant to imply a comparison (like synonyms or isomers).

However, isotope is an older and better known term than nuclide and is still sometimes used in contexts where nuclides might be more appropriate, such as nuclear technology and nuclear medicine.

When the chemical symbol was used, for example \"C\" for carbon, the standard notation (now known as \"AZE notation\" because A is the mass number, Z is the atomic number, and E is the element) is used to denote the mass number (nucleon number) with a superscript in the top left of a chemical element and to indicate the atomic number with a subscript at the bottom left (eg 32He, 42He, 126C, 146C, 23592U, and 23992U).",

The common pronunciation for the AZE notation differs from the way it is written: 42He is usually pronounced as helium-four, not four-two-helium, and 23592U as uranium-two-three-five or uranium twenty-thirty-five instead of 235-92- uranium. Some isotopes/nuclides are radioactive, and therefore they are referred to as radioisotopes or radionuclides, while those which have never been observed radioactively decaying are referred to as stable isotopes or stable nuclides. For example, 14C is the radioactive form of carbon, whereas 12C and 13C are stable isotopes. There are approximately 339 naturally occurring nuclides on Earth, and 286 of these are primordial nuclides, meaning they have been around since the formation of the Solar System. Primordial nuclides include 34 nuclides with very long half-lives (over 100 million years) and 252 that are formally considered \"stable nuclides\", because they have not been observed to decay.

The existence of isotopes was first suggested in 1913 by radiochemist Frederick Soddy, based on studies of radioactive decay chains which showed about 40 different species of so-called radio elements (i.e. radioactive elements) between uranium and lead, although the periodic table only allowed for 11 elements between lead and uranium inclusive. Several attempts to chemically separate these new radio elements have failed. For example, Soddy had shown in 1910 that mesotorium (later shown to be 228Ra), radium (226Ra, the longest-lived isotope), and thorium X (224Ra) were impossible to separate. Attempts to place radio elements on the periodic table led Soddy and Kazimierz Fajans to independently propose their law of radioactive displacement in 1913, which states that alpha decay produces an element two places to the left of the periodic table, whereas beta decay emission results in an element one to the left. right.

The term \"isotope\", Greek for \"in the same place\", was suggested to Soddy by Margaret Todd, a Scottish physician and family friend, during a conversation in which he explained his ideas to her. He won the 1921 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on isotopes. In 1914 T. W. Richards discovered the variation between the atomic weights of lead from different mineral sources, which was caused by variations in isotope composition due to different radioactive origins. The first evidence for multiple isotopes of a stable (nonradioactive) element was discovered by J. J. Thomson in 1912 as part of his exploration into the composition of canal rays (positive ions). Thomson channeled streams of neon ions through parallel magnetic and electric fields, measured their deflection by placing photographic plates in their path, and calculated the mass-to-charge ratio using a method that became known as Thomson's parabolic method. Each stream will create a glowing patch on the plate at the point it hits. Thomson observed two separate patches of parabolic light on a photographic plate (see image), showing two species of nuclei with different mass-to-charge ratios. F. W. Aston later discovered several stable isotopes for many elements using the mass spectrograph. In 1919, Aston studied neon with sufficient resolution to show that the two isotope masses are very close to the integer integers 20 and 22 and that they are not equal to the known molar masses (20.2) of neon gas. This is an example of Aston's integer rule for isotope masses, which states that large deviations from the integer molar mass of an element are primarily due to the fact that the element is a mixture of isotopes.",

Since the chemical behavior of atoms is largely determined by their electronic structure, different isotopes exhibit nearly identical chemical behavior. The main exception to this is the kinetic isotope effect: because of their greater mass, heavier isotopes tend to react somewhat more slowly than lighter isotopes of the same element. This is most evident for protium (1H), deuterium (2H), and tritium (3H), having twice the mass of protium and tritium having three times the mass of protium. This mass difference also affects the behavior of their respective chemical bonds, by changing the center of gravity (reduced mass) of the atomic system. However, for heavier elements, the relative mass differences between the isotopes are so much smaller that the effects of mass differences on chemistry are usually negligible. (Heavy elements also have relatively more neutrons than lighter elements, so the ratio of nuclear mass to collective electronic mass is slightly larger.) There is also an isotope equilibrium effect. Similarly, two molecules that differ only in their atomic isotopes (isotologues) have identical electronic structures, and therefore nearly indistinguishable physical and chemical properties (again with deuterium and tritium being major exceptions). The vibrational mode of a molecule is determined by the shape and mass of the constituent atoms; so different isotopes have different sets of vibrational modes. Because the vibrational mode allows the molecule to absorb photons of the appropriate energy, isotopes have different optical properties in the infrared range.",

        "paragraph": "The atomic nucleus consists of protons and neutrons which are held together by the residual strong force. Since protons are positively charged, they repel each other. Neutrons, being electrically neutral, stabilize the nucleus in two ways. Their presence pushes the protons slightly apart, reducing the electrostatic repulsion between the protons, and they exert an attractive nuclear force on each other and on the protons. For this reason, one or more neutrons are required to bind two or more protons to form a nucleus. As the number of protons increases, so does the ratio of neutrons to protons required to ensure a stable nucleus (see graphic at right). For example, although the neutron:proton ratio of 32He is 1:2, the neutron:proton ratio of 23892U is greater than 3:2. A number of lighter elements have stable nuclides at a ratio of 1:1 (Z = N). Nuclide 4020Ca (calcium-40) is observationally the heaviest stable nuclide with an equal number of neutrons and protons. All stable nuclides heavier than calcium-40 contain more neutrons than protons. Of the 80 elements with stable isotopes, the largest number of stable isotopes observed for each element is ten (for tin). No element has nine or eight stable isotopes. Five elements have seven stable isotopes, eight have six stable isotopes, ten have five stable isotopes, nine have four stable isotopes, five have three stable isotopes, 16 have two stable isotopes (listing 180m73Ta as a stable), and 26 elements have only one isotope. stable (of these, 19 are referred to as mononuclide elements, having a single primordial stable isotope that dominates and assigns the atomic weights of natural elements to high precision; 3 radioactive mononuclide elements also occur).",

The proton:neutron ratio is not the only factor affecting nuclear stability. It also depends on the evenness or oddness of the atomic number Z, the number of neutrons N, and, consequently, their number, the mass number A. The oddness of Z and N tends to lower the binding energies of nuclei, making odd nuclei, in general, less stable. . The extraordinary differences in nuclear binding energies between neighboring nuclei, especially the odd-A isobars, have an important consequence: unstable isotopes with suboptimal numbers of neutrons or protons decay via beta decay (including positron emission), electron capture, or other appropriate decay modes. less common such as spontaneous fission and group decay. The majority of stable nuclides are even-proton-even neutrons, where all the numbers Z, N, and A are even. The odd-A stable nuclides are divided (more or less evenly) into odd-even-proton-odd-neutron nuclides, and odd-even-neutron-proton nuclides. Stable odd-proton-odd-neutron nuclei are the least common. The 146 even-proton, even-neutron (GnGn) nuclides comprise ~58% of all stable nuclides and all have spin 0 due to pairing. There are also 24 long-lived primordial even-even nuclides. Consequently, each of the 41 even elements from 2 to 82 has at least one stable isotope, and most of these elements have several primordial isotopes. Half of the even-numbered elements have six or more stable isotopes.

Primordial isotopes are the product of stellar nucleosynthesis or other types of nucleosynthesis such as cosmic ray spallation, and have survived to the present because of their very slow decay rates (eg uranium-238 and potassium-40). Postprimordial isotopes are created by bombardment of cosmic rays as cosmogenic nuclides (eg, tritium, carbon-14), or by the decay of radioactive primordial isotopes into their daughters which are radiogenic nuclides (eg, uranium into radium). Some isotopes are naturally synthesized as nucleogenic nuclides, by some other natural nuclear reactions, such as when a neutron from natural nuclear fission is absorbed by another atom.

The abundance of each isotope on Earth results from the amount formed by these processes, their distribution through the galaxy, and the rate of decay of the unstable isotopes. After the initial merger of the Solar System, isotopes were redistributed according to mass, and the elemental composition of the isotopes varied slightly from planet to planet. This sometimes makes it possible to trace the origin of meteorites. The atomic mass (mr) of an isotope (nuclide) is determined mainly by its mass number (i.e. the number of nucleons in its nucleus). The small corrections are caused by the binding energy of the nucleus (see mass defect), the slight difference in mass between the proton and the neutron, and the mass of the electron associated with the atom, the latter because the electron:nucleon ratio differs between isotopes. The mass number is a dimensionless quantity. Atomic mass, on the other hand, is measured using atomic mass units based on the atomic mass of carbon-12. It is denoted by the symbol \"u\" \u200b\u200b(for unified atomic mass unit) or \"Da\" (for dalton).

Both definitions are properties that light exhibits simultaneously so it is called \"wave-particle dualism\". Packages of light called the spectrum are then perceived visually by the sense of sight as colors. The field of study of light, known as optics, is an important research area in modern physics. The study of light began with the emergence of the era of classical optics which studied optical quantities such as: intensity, frequency or wavelength, polarization and phase of light. The properties of light and its interaction with the surroundings are carried out using a geometric paraxial approach such as reflection and refraction, and an approach to its physical optical properties, namely: interference, diffraction, dispersion, polarization. Each study of classical optics is called geometrical optics (en:geometrical optics) and physical optics (en:physical optics). At the peak of classical optics, light was defined as an electromagnetic wave and sparked a series of discoveries and thoughts, dating back to 1838 by Michael Faraday with the discovery of cathode rays, 1859 with the theory of black mass radiation by Gustav Kirchhoff, 1877 Ludwig Boltzmann said that the energy states of physical systems can be became discrete, quantum theory as a model of black mass radiation theory by Max Planck in 1899 with the hypothesis that radiated and absorbed energy could be divided into discrete quantities called elemental energies, E.

In the fifth century BC, Empedocles stated that the goddess Aphrodite created the human eye from these four elements. He also kindled a fire in the eyes so that rays came out of the eyes and allowed humans to see. Empedocles added that there is an interaction between light from the eye and light from sources such as the sun so that humans cannot see at night. Around 300 BC, Euclid wrote his Optica which discussed the properties of light. Euclid stated that light travels in straight lines and he studied the laws of reflection mathematically.

According to phylogenetic taxonomic studies, dinosaurs are usually defined as \"the group consisting of Triceratops, Neornithes (modern birds), and all their ancestors and descendants\". There is also an opinion that Dinosauria is related to Megalosaurus and Iguanodon, because these two genera were used by Richard Owen as the basis for naming Dinosauria. The two definitions above are basically the same, defining dinosaurs: \"Dinosauria = Ornithischia + Saurischia\", which includes theropods (mostly carnivores with two legs and birds), ankylosaurs (herbivores with four legs covered with skin), stegosauria (herbivores with four legs with backs of horns) ceratopsians (four-legged herbivores with horns and neck plates), ornithopods (bipedal herbivores or \"duck-billed\" quadrupeds), and sauropodomorpha (mostly quadrupedal herbivores with long necks and tails).

Dinosaurs were poikilotherms, cold-blooded animals like modern reptiles that had to get sunlight as their energy source in addition to food.

In taxonomy, this is called a synapomorphy. S. Nesbitt presents his findings regarding the relationship between archosaur and dinosaur synapomorphies: Nesbitt also found a number of other synapomorphies between archosaurs and dinosaurs, among them also present in silesaurids, which Nesbitt says are similar to Dinosauria, including a large anterior trochanter, metatarsals II and IV with long the same, lack of contact between the ischium and pubis, the presence of a cnemial crest on the tibia, the ascending process of the astragalus, and so on. Various other skeletal characteristics are also shared by dinosaurs. However, because these characteristics were unique to the archosaur group or were not present in all early dinosaur species, they are not considered synapomorphies. For example, as members of the diapsid reptiles, the dinosaur descendants had two pairs of temporary fenestrae (on the skull behind the eyes), whereas as members of the archosaur diapsid, the dinosaurs had additional fenestrae on the snout and lower jaw. In addition, several characteristics previously thought to be synapomorphy are known to have existed before the existence of the dinosaurs, or were absent from early dinosaurs and evolved recently in different groups of dinosaurs.

Dinosaurs stood upright like most modern mammals, but differed from most reptiles, in that they slithered or crawled. This is caused by the development of a lateral recess in the hip (usually an open joint) that connects to the femur. This upright posture allowed ancient dinosaurs to breathe easily while moving, which required a much greater level of stamina and activity when compared to other reptiles. These erect limbs may have also helped support the evolution of large dinosaurs by reducing the flexibility of the limbs. Several non-dinosaur achosaurs, including rauisuchia, also had erect limbs, but imperfectly erect (semi-erect or pillar-erect); the upper pelvis is rotated so that the forelegs hang down. Dinosaurs developed into their own species and split from their common ancestor, the archosaurs, about 230 million years ago, in the Middle Triassic to Late Triassic period, roughly 20 million years after the Permian-Triassic extinction event that wiped out nearly 95% of life on Earth. Radiometric dating of rock formations containing fossils of early dinosaurs such as the genus Eoraptor proves it is the oldest dinosaur on Earth. Paleontologists think that Eoraptor may have been the common ancestor of all dinosaurs; if this is true, then it can be concluded that at first, the characteristics of dinosaurs were small stature, and two-legged predators. The discovery of dinosaur-like ornithodiran prehistoric animals such as Marasuchus and Lagerpeton in Argentina also supports this opinion. In order to be classified as a dinosaur, the fossil or presumptive origin of a living thing, especially an animal, must have the following characteristics: As of December 2015, more than 1,600 dinosaur genera were known, but approximately 30% of these are synonymous names ( invalid).",

        "paragraph": "This is because, just like today, dinosaur fossils correspond to the state of the animal when it was still alive. If a certain dinosaur species was already rare when it was alive, its fossils will be even rarer. One example is the fossils of Iguanodon, Megalosaurus, or Allosaurus, which have such a wide distribution that they are found on several different continents. On the other hand, fossils such as Argentinosaurus, Therizinosaurus, or Deinocheirus are very narrow and very rare. Dinosaurs also used a nomenclature binomial name system, as coined by biologist Carolus Linnaeus. Each dinosaur has two names, one first name as the genus name and one last name as the species name. For example Tyrannosaurus rex, Brachiosaurus altithorax, Triceratops horridus, or Stegosaurus armatus. Usually, outside of scientific circles, only the genus name is used. But the full name caught the attention of so many people that it was often included, which also added to the meaning of the dinosaur. For example Triceratops means \"three-horned face\", but if the species name is also used (horridus) means \"terrifying three-horned face\". All dinosaurs lived during the Mesozoic (Middle Ages) which took place after the Paleozoic and before the Cenozoic / Neozoic of the Phanerozoic (Visible Life) Eon. The Mesozoic period lasted between 250-65 million years ago. The Mesozoic Era is divided into three periods, namely the Triassic / Triassic Period (250-206 million years ago), Jurassic / Jurassic (205-145 million years ago), and the Cretaceous / Cretaceous (144-65 million years ago). Not all dinosaurs lived at the same time, for example Stegosaurus and Tyrannosaurus never met because Stegosaurus lived in the Jurassic Period, while Tyrannosaurus lived in the Cretaceous Period. Dinosaurs first appeared in the Late Triassic Period of the Carnian Period, about 237 million years ago, then developed constantly and then exploded during the Early Jurassic Period.",

Because their teeth were only at the front of their mouths for pulling up plants, Sauropodomorpha aided digestion by swallowing pebbles, called gastroliths, to help grind up food in the stomach. If the gastroliths are blunt and cannot grind to the fullest, they will spit it out and swallow the new gravel. Some Sauropodomorpha fossils contain more than 200 gastroliths in their stomachs. Some scientists disagree with this opinion. They assumed that the stones were accidentally swallowed. Carnivorous dinosaurs evolved from their earliest appearances, equipped with hinged jaws and sharp, serrated teeth. The most common group is called the Carnosaurs, but more recently the Maniraptorian group developed the digestive structures of both omnivores and herbivores. One of the most dangerous types of carnivores was the Tyrannosaur, which had jaw muscles that were stronger than any land predator that ever lived. The teeth of Tyrannosaurs were shorter than those of Carnosaurs and had fewer but thicker serrations with stronger root teeth. Most carnivorous dinosaurs directly hunted their prey, either alone or in groups, also by searching for carcasses, or snatching prey from smaller predators. Some dinosaurs such as ''Majungasaurus'' showed cannibalistic traits. Several dinosaur groups such as Spinosauria are also known to have specialized for catching fish and aquatic animals. Carnivorous dinosaurs swallowed chunks of meat whole and had shorter digestive systems than herbivorous dinosaurs. Omnivorous dinosaurs generally had few or no teeth at all, mostly including the Ornithomimoidea and Oviraptoria groups which were of medium and small stature with high mobility. They usually eat lizards, eggs, frogs, small mammals, ferns, ferns, flowering plants, or plant roots, and possibly fish and carrion.",

        "paragraph": "The behavior of dinosaurs is one of the most exciting topics to be discussed as well as being a hot debate among paleontologists and modern biologists for decades. Fossils tell us about the body structure of dinosaurs, and also indicate where they lived, but because soft body tissues such as internal organs are rarely preserved, the behavior of dinosaurs is still a mystery even though little is being uncovered. Basically, almost all of our assumptions about the behavior of dinosaurs are generally wrong. Initially, dinosaurs were seen as slow animals who were stupid and did not take care of their babies. We now know that many bipedal dinosaurs could run fast with good agility, especially for hunting small prey or escaping from carnivores. We now also know that a Maniraptorian group called the Dromaeosaurids had a brain that was comparatively bigger than any other reptile. The eyes of late theropod dinosaurs displayed stereoscopic vision which was useful for measuring distances to prey. From their eye sockets, we can also estimate whether the dinosaur was active during the day (diurnal) or at night (nocturnal). Defense Herbivorous dinosaurs absolutely needed self-defence against carnivores, which varied according to their group. The Sauropodomorpha group relied on their gigantic body size to ward off predators. Generally, Sauropodomorpha were five to ten times larger than their meat-eating contemporaries. In addition, they also developed whip tails, strong legs, claws, and in some cases they had extra body armor (''Ampelosaurus'' and ''Agustinia'') and thagomizers such as Stegosauria (''Spinophorosaurus'') and mace. tail like Ankylosauria (''Shunosaurus''). The use of tail whips is disputed. Some experts agree that the long tails of sauropods such as Diplodocus and ''Apatosaurus'' could wrap around a predator's body and slam it or whip the predator with its tail, but this action could injure the caudal vertebrae.",

        "paragraph": "Others agree that the booming sound made when a giant sauropod's tail was flicked in the air was enough to scare away predators. These giant dinosaurs could also stand on two legs to make them look even bigger and scarier. The dinosaur with the most impressive defense is Thyreophora. In the Jurassic Period, Stegosaur predominated with plates on the neck, back, and tail, and tail spines known as thagomizers, which could have inflicted fatal wounds on predators. The best example of the use of the thagomizer is found in the Allosaurus fossil whose vertebra was badly injured by the stab of the thagomizer belonging to Stegosaurus. Ankylosaurs have a more comprehensive defense, even some species such as ''Minmi'' from Australia also have a protector in the stomach. Ankylosaurs such as Ankylosaurus and Euoplocephalus lived alongside dangerous predators such as Tyrannosaurus and Albertosaurus, so they needed strong defenses. Ankylosaurs developed shields of bony prominences covering their necks, backs, and tails, and even bony eyelids. In some Nodosaur species, such as Sauropelta and Edmontonia, their shoulder armor developed into giant spines capable of delivering lethal jabs to the theropod legs. The Ankylosaur mace, made of several solid bones fused together, could weigh as much as 30 kg. One swing was enough to crack a Theropod's leg bone, ribs, or even skull. Other impressive dinosaurs were Marginocephalia, especially Ceratopsia. They developed a giant collar-like tuft, composed of bone, that protected the neck from predators' bites. Ceratopsia horns are also capable of causing great damage. Some experts disagree with this opinion. They thought that some Ceratopsians had neck collars that were too thin to be used for defense, and that their horns were hollow and broke easily. However, some Ceratopsians such as Triceratops show damage to the horns and tufts most likely caused by fighting with predators.",

        "paragraph": "In general, even if they were not used directly in combat, Ceratopsia were not the first choice for predators because their tufts and horns could already intimidate predators. Other Marginocephalians such as Pachycephalosauria and Ornithopods employ a simple defense strategy: they run as fast as they can. They develop strong leg muscles so they can run up to speeds of 45 km/h for a long time. They also live in groups of hundreds to thousands of animals to minimize the possibility of prey. Some Ornithopods also use loud noises to scare off predators. Breeding Sexual diformism in dinosaurs is most visible in the Ornithopods and Marginocephalia groups. In combed ornithopods such as Parasaurolophus, Corythosaurus, and Lambeosaurus, a large comb indicated that the dinosaur was a male and vice versa. This is agreed upon by every scientist because modern animals also have the same characteristics, for example the male peacock has a long tail, the horns of the male deer are larger than the female, and vice versa. Marginocephalia such as Ceratopsia do the same with their tufts and horns. Experts think that Ceratopsia's tufts are saturated with blood, so they can change the skin color of the tufts at certain times to attract females. Ritual 'head banging' is also common in Pachycephalosauria and Ceratopsia. Ceratopsians horned with each other with their large horns to fight over females. The skull of Pachycephalosaurus could be up to 25 cm thick (the average human skull is only 5.5 mm thick) and was strong enough to withstand impacts. However, instead of butting heads, they may just shove their heads together or play thumps on bodies. Too frequent collisions are also not good for their head structure. Stegosaurs also had blood-stained plates, which may also have changed color when trying to attract a female.",

Theropod combs such as Dilophosaurus probably functioned the same way, because, although made of bone, they were too thin for fighting. Many paleontologists think that some Theropods such as Tyrannosaurus must have provided 'gifts' to seduce females, such as food, because the female Tyrannosaurus was one meter longer than the male and nearly a ton heavier. Sauropodomorpha such as Giraffatitan probably used neck-fights like modern giraffes to fight over females. Treatment One of the most famous ethological fallacies of dinosaurs is the discovery of a dinosaur fossil lying on its stomach in a nest filled with eggs. Paleontologists named it Oviraptor, which means egg thief, on the assumption that the dinosaur died while trying to steal the eggs of other dinosaurs. However, decades later we learn that Oviraptor died protecting its own nest, possibly from a sandstorm. It shows the archetype of animal care: looking after the eggs. It didn't stop there, many dinosaurs, especially Ornithopods and Theropods, looked after their babies, feeding them until they were old enough to live on their own. This parenting pattern was later passed down to the results of the evolution of dinosaurs, namely birds. The first discoveries regarding egg and baby care patterns occurred in the Two Medicine Formation, where a dinosaur named Maiasaura (meaning \u201cgood mother lizard\u201d) resided in a nesting site, each nest 7-9 meters apart, which is as long as an adult Maiasaura . Maiasaura cared for their babies and included them in groups like most herbivorous mammals today. One of the strangest parenting behaviors was obtained from Troodon, a 3.5 meter long Maniraptorian who deposited its eggs in the nests of other dinosaurs so that the parents did not have to work hard to care for their young. similar to the behavior of modern turtledoves.",

Territorial Modern birds are arguably some of the most stringent animals to guard their territories and hunting grounds, so we can safely conclude that this behavior was most likely inherited from their common ancestor: the dinosaurs. Especially theropods, territory is becoming an important issue. Flesh-eating dinosaurs could fight both with each other and with different species for territory. Many fossils have proven this, especially in Carnosauria and Tyrannosauria, there are bite marks from both the same and different species. In some cases, theropods take even more extreme actions, namely cannibalism. This is known from fossils of Majungasaurus from Madagascar, and most likely a Tyrannosaur. All experts agree that dinosaurs were the largest animals that ever walked the earth. The largest dinosaurs were in the Sauropodomorpha group, which could have grown up to ten times larger than the largest land mammal, Paraceratherium, and ten times larger than the largest carnivorous dinosaurs or the largest Ornithschia dinosaurs. The size of giant dinosaurs has increased rapidly in recent decades. Previously, the most popular giant dinosaur was Brachiosaurus, which was claimed to have reached 25 m in length, 13 m in height and weighed 50 tonnes. In 1987 in Argentina, Argentinosaurus fossils were found. Estimates of the size of this dinosaur reached 35 or 40 m in length and weighed about 80-100 tons.

The use of the maple leaf as a symbol of Canada dates back to the 18th century, and is depicted on the current flag, and earlier, on the penny, and on the coat of arms. Canada is known for its extensive forests, and mountain ranges (including the Rocky Mountains in Alberta, and British Columbia), and the wild animals that live in them, such as moose, caribou, otters, polar bears, and grizzly bears. Canada is also well known for its Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and products made from domestic natural resources, such as maple syrup. Anything pertaining to hockey, Canada's official winter sport, is also often used as a symbol of national unity and pride; The country's snowy, cold winters and northern climate have also shaped the Canadian outlook. Canada is an industrial and technologically advanced country, sufficient in energy procurement due to the availability of fossil fuels, nuclear energy and hydroelectric power. Its economy is dependent on an abundance of natural resources, and trade, especially with the United States, with which Canada has an extensive, and long-standing relationship (see US-Canada Relations). Despite Canada's modern, expanding economy, natural resources remain the driving force of the country's economy. The Canadian economy is now approaching that of the United States with a market-oriented economic system, production patterns, and a high standard of living. In the last century, tremendous growth in the production, mining, and service sectors has transformed the country from a rural economy to an urban-industrial one. Self-sufficient energy, Canada has large reserves of natural gas on the east coast, and three western provinces, as well as many other resources. Canada has managed to avoid an economic recession after 2001, and has maintained the best economic growth in the G8 group.",

In addition, Canadian culture has also been influenced by American culture due to the proximity of the 2 countries, and the migration of people, ideas, capital and politics across borders. Despite this inherited culture, Canadian culture has developed many unique traits. In many ways, Canadian culture is more robust, and distinctly has evolved in recent years, primarily because of the sense of nationality that pervaded Canada in the years that surrendered, and following the Canadian Centenary in 1967, and also because of the focus on programs to support arts, and culture of Canada by the federal government. Early Europeans helped from a Canadian cultural base. During the colonization of Canada the settlers wrote many folk tales about the lands around them.

The series of celebrations officially takes place from the 5th and ends on the 12th of Mulud on the Javanese calendar (equivalent to Rabiul Awal on the Hijri calendar). Some of the important events of this celebration were the playing of heritage gamelan in the courtyard of the Grand Mosque of each palace, reading the biography of the Prophet Muhammad and a series of recitations in the foyer of the Grand Mosque and, the climax was the holding of the Grebeg Maulud celebration as a form of gratitude for the palace by releasing a number of gunungan to be fought over by society. This celebration is also enlivened by the night market (commonly called \"Sekatenan\") which is held in the North square of each Palace which lasts for about 40 days, starting at the beginning of the month of Sapar (Safar). Most literature agrees that the name \"sekaten\" is an adaptation of the Arabic term, syahadatain, which means \"two testimonies (syahadat). The expansion of the meaning of sekaten can be associated with the terms Sahutain (stopping or avoiding case two, namely promiscuity and deviance), Sakhatain (removing case two, namely animal nature and demonic nature), Sakhotain (instilling case two, namely always maintaining a pure mind or mind noble and always devoted himself to God), Sekti (balanced, living people must be able to weigh or evaluate good and bad things, and Separation (limits, living people must limit themselves not to do evil and know the boundaries of good and evil ) According to Puger (2002), the beginning and purpose of the Sekaten celebration can be traced back to the beginning of the Islamic kingdoms in Java, namely the era of the Demak Sultanate. Sekaten was held as an effort to spread the Islamic religion. Because the Javanese at that time liked gamelan, on the day Islamic feast, namely on the birthday of the Prophet Muhammad, in the yard of the Great Mosque of Demak, gamelan was played, so that the people flocked to the the courtyard of the mosque to listen to gamelan and at the same time sermons on Islam.",

In Sanskrit, the term Bodhisattva consists of two words, namely bodhi which means enlightenment or illumination, and sattwa which means creature. Bodhisattva also refers to the Buddha in his previous life. In Mahayana teachings, Bodhisattvas take a vow not to enter nirvana until all beings have attained Buddhahood. This means that he postponed entering nirvana and chose to descend to earth to sacrifice himself to help other beings achieve enlightenment. That's why Bodhisattvas are known to have compassion and selflessness and self-sacrifice. This is not the same as in the traditional Theravada tradition, beings who attain enlightenment are Arhats, not Buddhas. The Bodhisattva meaning in the Pali Canon (collection of scriptures on Theravada teachings) and Theravada tradition does not say that a Bodhisattva makes a promise not to become enlightened until everyone else is enlightened. This is an innovation from Mahayana. So a Bodhisatta and a Bodhisattva are different things. Bodhisattvas are much admired in famous art, including one of the tallest statues of the Bodhisattva at Puning Monastery in China, built in 1755. The Pali word Bodhisattva is used by the Buddha in the Pali Canon to refer to himself in previous and present lives towards enlightenment and in the period when he was still moving towards liberation. Siddhartha Gautama's life as a Bodhisattva is recorded in the Jataka Book. When Siddhartha Gautama talks about himself first, he uses the term \"when I was a Bodhisattva\".

        "paragraph": "Chromatography is a molecular separation technique based on differences in movement patterns between the mobile phase and the stationary phase to separate components (in the form of molecules) in solution. Molecules dissolved in the mobile phase will pass through the column which is the stationary phase. Molecules that have strong bonds with the column will tend to move more slowly than molecules with weak bonds. With this, various types of molecules can be separated based on the movement in the column. Once the components have eluted from the column, they can be analyzed using a detector or they can be collected for further analysis. Several analytical tools can be combined with separation methods for on-line analysis such as: combination of gas chromatography and liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry (GC-MS and LC-MS), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (GC -FTIR), and UV-VIS diode-arrays (HPLC-UV-VIS). Chromatographic methods are divided into two basic types, namely column chromatography and planar chromatography. In column chromatography, the stationary phase is held in a narrow column and the mobile phase is pushed through the column by pressure or gravity. In planar chromatography, the stationary phase is suspended on a flat plate or in the pores of the paper, and the mobile phase moves through it due to capillary action or due to the influence of gravity. Chromatographic methods are divided into three categories based on the nature of the mobile phase: liquid, gas and supercritical liquid. Liquid chromatography is an appropriate technique for separating ions or molecules dissolved in a solution. If the sample solution interacts with the stationary phase, then the molecules in it interact with the stationary phase; however, the interactions differ due to differences in absorption, ion exchange, partitioning, or size. This difference makes the components separate from one another and the difference can be seen from the length of transit time these components pass through the column.",

This method is commonly used for the extraction and separation of non-volatile compounds. High performance liquid chromatography is similar in principle to reversed phase chromatography. It's just that in this method, high pressure and speed are used. Columns used in high performance liquid chromatography are shorter and smaller in diameter, but can produce large numbers of several equilibrium states.

Ion exchange chromatography is commonly used for the purification of biological materials, such as amino acids, peptides, proteins. This method can be carried out in two types, namely in columns and in flat (planar) spaces. There are two types of ion exchange, namely cation exchange and anion exchange. In cation exchange, the stationary phase is negatively charged; whereas in anion exchange, the stationary phase is positively charged. Charged molecules that are in the liquid phase will pass through the column. If the charge on the molecule is the same as that of the column, then the molecule will elute. However, if the charge on the molecule is not the same as that of the column, then the molecule will form an ionic bond with the column.",

'shadow') is a traditional Indonesian performing art that originated and developed rapidly on the islands of Java and Bali. On November 7, 2003, UNESCO, the institution in charge of culture from the United Nations, established wayang as the most famous shadow puppet show from Indonesia, an invaluable World Heritage Masterpiece in the Art of Speech (English: Masterpiece of Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity). Until now, the earliest record that can be obtained about wayang performances comes from the Balitung Inscription in the 10th Century. In 903 AD, an inscription called the Balitung Inscription (Mantyasih) was created by King Balitung of the Sanjaya Dynasty, from the Ancient Medang Kingdom. They declared Si Galigi Mawayang for Hyang Macarita Bimma Ya Kumara, which means 'Galigi puts on a puppet show for the gods by taking the story of Bima Kumara'. It seems that certain features of the traditional puppet theater have survived since then. Galigi was a traveling artist who was asked to perform for a special royal event. At that event he presented a story about the hero Bima from the Mahabharata. Mpu Kanwa, the court poet of Airlangga from the Kahuripan Kingdom, wrote in 1035 AD in his kakawin Arjunawiwaha: santo\u1e63\u00e2h\u0115l\u0115tan k\u0115lir sira sak\u00eang sang hyang Jagatk\u0101ra\u1e47a, which means, \"He is steadfast and only a puppet screen is far from the 'Mover of the World'.\" Kelir is the Javanese word for wayang screen, a verse that eloquently compares real life to a wayang performance in which the almighty Jagatk\u0101ra\u1e47a (world mover) as supreme dalang (wayang teacher) is but a thin screen of humans.

Duplodnaviria was defined in 2019 based on the similarity of virus characteristics in this taxon. There are two groups of viruses within Duplodnaviria: tailed bacteriophages from the order Caudovirales which infect prokaryotes and herpes viruses from the order Herpesvirales which infect animals. Tailed bacteriophages are extremely diverse and ubiquitous around the world, and they are perhaps the oldest viral lineages. Herpes viruses share a common ancestor with tailed bacteriophages or are a breakaway group from within Caudovirales. Tailless bacteriophages play an important role in marine ecology by recycling nutrients in the organic matter of their hosts and have been the focus of many studies, while herpes viruses are associated with various diseases in animals, including humans. A common feature among Duplodnaviria viruses is that many of them can survive in their hosts for long periods of time without replicating but may still reappear in the future. Examples of this include the herpes simplex virus which causes recurrent infections and the varicella zoster virus which initially causes chickenpox early in life and then shingles later in life. The name Duplodnaviria is a portmanteau of duplo, the Latin word for double, and dna, from deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), which refers that all members of this taxon have double-stranded DNA genomes, and -viria, which is the suffix used for the world of viruses.",

In plants and algae, galactosyldiacylglycerols and sulfokinovosildiacylglycerols, which lack phosphate groups, are important components of chloroplast membranes and associated organelles and are the most abundant lipids in photosynthetic tissues, including those of higher plants, algae, and certain bacteria. Bilayers have been found to exhibit high levels of multiple congruency which can be used to examine the degree of disorder (or disorder) within the bilayer using techniques such as double polarization interferometry. Triacylglycerol, stored in adipose tissue, is the main form of energy reserve in the animal body. Adipocytes, or fat cells, are designed for the continuous synthesis and breakdown of triacylglycerols, with breakdown primarily controlled by activation of the hormone-sensitive enzyme lipase. Complete oxidation of fatty acids gives a high caloric content, approximately 9 kcal/g, compared to 4 kcal/g for the breakdown of carbohydrates and proteins. Migratory birds that have to fly long distances without eating use their energy reserves of triacylglycerols to fuel their journey. In recent years, evidence has emerged showing that lipid signaling is an important part of cell signaling. Lipid signaling can occur through activation of G protein coupled receptors or nuclear receptors, and members of several different categories of lipids have been identified as signaling molecules and second messenger systems. These include sphingosine-1-phosphate, a ceramide-derived sphingolipid that is a potent messenger molecule involved in the regulation of calcium movement, cell growth, and apoptosis; diacylglycerols (DAGs) and phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs), which are involved in calcium-mediated activation of protein kinase C; prostaglandins, which are a type of eicosanoid-derived fatty acid involved in inflammation and immunity; steroid hormones such as estrogen, testosterone, and cortisol, which modulate reproductive function, metabolism, and blood pressure; and oxysterols such as 25-hydroxy-cholesterol which are hepatic X-receptor agonists.",

Acyl-carnitine is involved in the transport and metabolism of fatty acids in and outside the mitochondria, where they undergo beta-oxidation. Polyprenols and their phosphorylated derivatives also play an important transport role, in this case transport of oligosaccharides across membranes. Functions of polyprenol sugar phosphates and polyprenol diphosphate sugars in extra-cytoplasmic glycosylation reactions, in extracellular polysaccharide biosynthesis (eg, peptidoglycan polymerization in bacteria), and in N-glycosylated eukaryotic proteins. Cardiolipin is a sub-class of glycerophospholipids containing four acyl chains and three glycerol groups which are abundantly available especially in the inner mitochondrial membrane. They are believed to activate enzymes involved with oxidative phosphorylation. Fats that are food for humans and other animals are triglycerides, sterols, and membrane phospholipids present in animals and plants. The process of lipid metabolism synthesizes and reduces lipid stores and produces the functional and structural characteristics of lipids in individual tissues. Because the rhythm of the rate of carbohydrate intake is quite high for living things and puri is similar to hanoman, the intake must be immediately processed by the body, into energy or stored as glycogen. Good intake occurs when the energy contained in carbohydrates is equivalent to the energy needed by the body, and it is very difficult to achieve this balance. When carbohydrate intake becomes excessive, the excess will be converted into fat. Metabolism that occurs starts from: Meanwhile: This event involves the synthesis of fatty acids from acetyl-CoA and esterification of fatty acids during the manufacture of triacylglycerols, a process called lipogenesis or synthesis of fatty acids.",

The acyl chains of fatty acids are extended by a cycle of reactions that add an acetyl group, reduce it to an alcohol, dehydrate it to an alkene group and then reduce it back to an alkane group. The enzymes of fatty acid biosynthesis are divided into two groups, in animals and fungi, all of these fatty acid synthase reactions are handled by a single multifunctional protein, whereas in plants, plastids and bacteria separate the performance of the enzymes of each step in their pathway. Fatty acids can be converted into triacylglycerols which are wrapped in lipoproteins and secreted from the liver. The synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids involves a desaturation reaction, in which a double bond is introduced into the fatty acyl chain. For example, in humans, desaturation of stearic acid by desaturated stearoyl-CoA-1 produces oleic acid. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (linoleic acid) as well as polyunsaturated fatty acids (linolenic acid) cannot be synthesized in mammalian tissues, and are therefore essential fatty acids and must be obtained from the diet. Triacylglycerol synthesis occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum by a metabolic pathway in which the acyl groups in the fatty acyl-CoA are transferred to the hydroxyl groups of glycerol-3-phosphate and diacylglycerols. Terpenes and terpenoids, including carotenoids, are prepared by the assembly and modification of isoprene units donated from the reactive precursors isopentenyl pyrophosphate and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate. These precursors can be prepared in different ways. In animals and archaea, the mevalonate pathway produces this compound from acetyl-CoA, whereas in plants and bacteria the non-mevalonate pathway uses pyruvate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate as substrates. One important reaction that uses this active isoprene donor is steroid biosynthesis. Here, the isoprene units are combined to make squalene and then folded and formed into a set of rings to make lanosterol.",

Beta-oxidation is a metabolic process in which fatty acids are broken down in mitochondria and/or in peroxisomes to produce acetyl-CoA. For the most part, fatty acids are oxidized by a mechanism similar to, but unlike, the reverse process of fatty acid synthesis. That is, a two-carbon fraction is removed successively from the carboxyl end of the acid after dehydrogenation, hydration, and oxidation steps to form a beta-keto acid, which is cleaved by thiolysis. Acetyl-CoA is then converted to Adenosine triphosphate, CO2, and H2O using the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain. The energy obtained from the complete oxidation of palmitic fatty acid is 106 ATP. Odd-chain and unsaturated fatty acids require additional enzymatic steps for degradation. Most of the lipids found in food are in the form of triacylglycerols, cholesterol and phospholipids. Low levels of dietary fat are important to facilitate the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) and carotenoids. Humans and other mammals require food to meet their requirements for certain essential fatty acids, such as linoleic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid) and alpha-linolenic acid (a type of omega-3 fatty acid) because they cannot be synthesized from simple precursors in food. Both of these fatty acids have 18 carbons per molecule, polyunsaturated fats differ in the number and position of double bonds. Most vegetable oils are rich in linoleic acid (safflower, sunflower, and corn). Alpha-linolenic acid is found in the green leaves of plants, and in some seeds, nuts, and legumes (especially flax, rapeseed, walnuts, and soybeans). Fish oil is rich in the long-chain omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid.",

Mosques are usually closed buildings, but can be places where prayers (sujud) are performed, including the outer courtyard. Originally the mosque was a simple prayer place for Muslims, and was probably an open space rather than a building. In the first stage of Islamic architecture, 650-750, the mosque consisted of an open and closed room surrounded by a wall, often with a minaret from which the call to prayer was issued. The mosque building usually contains a mihrab mounted on a wall that shows the Qibla direction to Mecca, and ablution facilities. The pulpit, the place where the Friday prayer sermon is delivered, used to be a characteristic of downtown mosques, but has since become common in smaller mosques. Mosques usually have separate rooms for men and women. This organizational archetype took different forms depending on the region, period, and school. Mosques generally serve as locations for prayers, iftar of Ramadan, funeral prayers, weddings and business practices, collection and distribution of alms, as well as shelters for the homeless. Historically, mosques have served as community centers, courts, and religious schools. In modern times, they have also maintained their role as a place of religious teaching and debate. Special importance is given to the Masjidilharam (center of pilgrimage), the Nabawi Mosque in Medina (Muhammad's burial place) and the Masjidilaqsa in Jerusalem (believed to be the place of Muhammad's ascension to heaven). With the spread of Islam, mosques multiplied throughout the Islamic world. Sometimes churches and temples were converted into mosques, which influenced Islamic architectural styles. While most pre-modern mosques were funded by charitable donations, increased government regulation of large mosques has been matched by the emergence of privately funded mosques, many of which serve as bases for various Islamic revivalist organizations and social activities.",

The word masgid (m-s-g-d) is found in an inscription from the 5th century BC. The word masgid (m-s-g-d) means \"sacred pillar\" or \"place of worship\". In the maf'il pattern, the mosque means a place of prostration. Then, the mashdar pattern adds isim to become a mosque. This word means a mark of prostration that is visible on the forehead. The words mosque and mosque are the singular forms of the word mas\u00e2jid. The etymology of the mosque is based on one hadith, namely as a place of prostration on Earth. The locations are everywhere on Earth and there is no specific location for this place of prostration. In this sense, the mosque is a place for performing prayers which are holy from impurity. Some locations cannot be used as places of prayer or mosques because they are mentioned in the proposition. These places include burials, bathrooms, and stables. According to the terminology, the mosque is defined as land whose ownership is public and not private, which is used as a special place for worship. The ownership of the mosque is seen as belonging to Allah with the aim of being a place of prayer. The mosque's terminology specifically is the place where the five daily prayers are held. In this sense, a prayer room and a place specifically for Eid prayers are not categorized as a mosque. Based on this terminology, places for the poor and madrasas are also not included in the mosque category. In these places, the laws that apply to the mosque cannot be enforced.

When the Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him arrived in Medina, he decided to build a mosque, which is now known as the Nabawi Mosque, which means the Prophet's Mosque. The Prophet's Mosque is located in the center of Medina. The Prophet's Mosque was built in a large field. At the Prophet's Mosque, there is also a minbar which was often used by the Prophet Muhammad. The Prophet's Mosque became the heart of Medina at that time. The mosque is used for politicalactivities,urban planning, determining military strategy, and toenter intoagreements. In fact, in the area around the mosque isused as atemporary residence by the poor people. Currently, the Grand Mosque, the Prophet's Mosque and the al-Aqsa Mosque are the three holiest mosques in the world. Mosques were later built in areas outside the Arabian Peninsula, along with Muslims living outside the Arabian Peninsula. Egypt became the first area to be ruled by Muslim Arabs in 640. Since then, the Egyptian capital, Cairo, has been filled with mosques. Therefore, Cairo is known as the city of a thousand towers. Several mosques in Cairo function as Islamic schools or madrasas and even as hospitals. Mosques in Sicily and Spain did not imitate Visigothic architectural designs, but those of the Moors. Scientists then estimate that the pre-Islamic building forms were later changed to Islamic architectural forms in the Andalus and Maghreb style, such as the horseshoe arches on the mosque's doors.

Some of the earliest mosques in Turkey are the Aya Sofya, where in Byzantine times the Aya Sofya building was a cathedral. The Ottoman Empire had unique mosque architectural characteristics, consisting of massive domes, minarets and large exteriors. Mosques in the Ottoman Empire usually collaborated on high pillars, small passages between the safs, and high ceilings, also by combining the mihrab in one mosque. Until recently, Turkey was the home of the mosque which is characterized by Ottoman architecture. Gradually, the mosque entered several parts of Europe. The rapid growth in the number of mosques began to be seen a century ago, when many Muslim immigrants entered Europe. Major cities in Europe, such as Munich, London and Paris have large mosques with domes and minarets.

For example, the change in the function of the Umayyad Mosque, where the Umayyad caliph, Abdul Malik, took the St. Yohannes church in 705 from the Christians. The Ottoman Empire also converted several churches, monasteries and chapels in Istanbul, including the largest Ayasofya church which was converted into a mosque, after the fall of Constantinople in 1453 by Muhammad al-Fatih. Several other mosques were also established in areas holy to Judaism and Christianity, such as in Jerusalem. The Muslim rulers of India also built mosques only to fulfill their religious duties. On the other hand, the mosque has also been converted into another place of worship, such as a church. This was done by Christians in Spain who changed the function of the mosque in southern Spain to become a cathedral, following the collapse of the Umayyads in southern Spain.

Currently, in Saudi Arabia, the cities of Mecca and Medina are only permitted for Muslims. As for non-Muslims, they are directed to the city of Jeddah. In Surah At-Taubah verse 18 it is stated that the prosperity of the mosque is a sign of faith in Allah. Prospering the mosque can be interpreted as carrying out worship and helping the construction of the mosque.

Its position is based on the position of the mosque as a means of congregational prayer and its role in other Islamic worship.",

All organisms have cells. Organisms are classified on the basis of taxonomy and are grouped into groups such as animals, plants and fungi which are multicellular; or unicellular microorganisms such as protists, bacteria, and archaea. All types of organisms are capable of reproduction, growth and development, self-maintenance, and some forms of response to stimuli. Humans, squid, fungi, and vascular plants are all examples of multicellular organisms that differentiate to form specialized tissues and organs during development. Organisms can be classified into prokaryotes or eukaryotes. Prokaryotes include two separate domains, namely bacteria and archaea. Eukaryotes are characterized by the presence of a cell nucleus that is covered with a membrane and has organelles, which are also covered with a membrane (examples of organelles are mitochondria in animals and plants, and plastids in plants and algae, generally all organelles are considered to originate from endosymbiotic bacteria). Fungi, animals, and plants are examples of kingdoms within eukaryotes. Estimates of the number of species on Earth today range from two million to one trillion and more than 1.7 million of them have been documented. More than 99% of all the species with over five billion species that have ever lived are now thought to be extinct. In 2016, 355 genes from the last universal ancestor (LUCA) of all organisms were identified.

The dictionary definition could be broader, using phrases such as \"any living structure, such as a plant, animal, fungus, or bacterium, capable of growth and reproduction.\" Many definitions exclude viruses and possibly man-made inorganic life forms because viruses depend on the biochemical machinery of the host cell to reproduce. A superorganism is an organism consisting of many individuals working together as a single functional or social unit. Controversy exists about the best way to define organisms and about whether or not such a definition is necessary. Several studies were written in response to suggestions that the category \"organism\" may be inadequate in biology. page\u00a0required] Viruses are not usually considered organisms because they are incapable of independent reproduction, growth, or metabolism. Although some organisms are also unable to survive on their own and must live as intracellular parasites, they are capable of metabolizing and reproducing independently. Although viruses possess some of the enzymes and molecules characteristic of living organisms, they do not have their own metabolism; viruses are unable to synthesize and organize the organic compounds that compose them. Naturally, these cannot be called autonomous reproduction: they can only be passively replicated by the host cell. In this respect, they are similar to inanimate objects. Although viruses do not maintain metabolism independently and are therefore not classified as organisms, they do have their own genes and evolve by a mechanism similar to that of organisms. Thus, the argument that viruses should be classified as living organisms is based on their ability to evolve and replicate through self-assembly.",

If host cells were not present, viral evolution would be impossible. This does not apply to cells. If viruses were not present, cell evolution might have been different, but cells could still have evolved. In order to reproduce, viruses completely depend on components of the host cell to replicate. The discovery of viruses that have genes for encoding energy metabolism and protein synthesis sparked debate about whether viruses are living organisms. The presence of these genes indicates that the virus once metabolized. However, later findings suggested that the genes encoding energy and protein metabolism originate from cells. Most likely, these genes were acquired via horizontal gene transfer from the viral host. Organisms are complex chemical systems, which are organized in ways that support reproduction and survival. The laws that govern the chemical processes of inanimate matter also govern the chemical processes of life. These processes generally govern all the phenomena of organisms and determine the ability of these organisms to adapt to the environment and determine the survival of their DNA-based genes. The origin, metabolism, and many other internal functions of organisms are governed by chemical phenomena, especially the chemistry of large organic molecules. In a way, organisms are chemical compounds in complex systems, which play various roles through interactions with their environment. Organisms are semi-closed chemical systems. Although they are individual units of life (by definition), organisms are not closed off to the environment around them. To operate, organisms constantly receive and release energy. Autotrophic organisms produce energy (in the form of organic compounds) using light from the sun or inorganic compounds while heterotrophs take organic compounds from the environment.",

The chemical properties of the element such as its great affinity for bonding with other small atoms, including other carbon atoms, and its small size allow it to form many bonds. These things make carbon the ideal basis of organic life. Carbon is capable of forming compounds consisting of three small atoms (eg carbon dioxide), as well as large chains of thousands of atoms that can store data (eg nucleic acids), hold cells together and transmit information (proteins). The compounds that make up organisms can be divided into large molecules (macromolecules) and smaller molecules. Macromolecules are divided into four groups, namely nucleic acids, proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids. Nucleic acids (especially DNA) store genetic data as nucleotide sequences. Four different types of nucleotides (adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine) form specific sequences that determine various characteristics of an organism. The sequence is divided into codons, which are combinations of three nucleotides in a specific order, which code for a particular amino acid. In other words, a DNA sequence encodes for a specific protein that folds in a certain way (due to the chemical properties of its constituent amino acids) and performs a specific function. Some of the functions of proteins are known, namely as follows: A double layer of phospholipids forms the cell membrane which is a barrier, holding everything inside the cell, and preventing compounds from freely entering the cell and leaving the cell. Due to this property of selective permeability, only specific compounds can pass through the phospholipid bilayer. All organisms are composed of structural units called cells; some organisms are only a single cell (unicellular) and others have many units (multicellular). Multicellular organisms can specialize their cells to perform certain functions.",

This pattern continues to a higher level, several organs forming organ systems such as the reproductive system and digestive system. Many multicellular organisms have multiple organ systems, which coordinate to make life possible. The cell theory, first developed in 1839 by Schleiden and Schwann, states that all organisms are composed of one or more cells; all cells come from pre-existing cells; and cells contain the hereditary information needed to regulate cell function and to pass the information on to the next generation of cells. There are two types of cells, namely eukaryotic and prokaryotic. Prokaryotic cells are usually single, whereas eukaryotic cells are usually found in multicellular organisms. Prokaryotic cells do not have a nuclear membrane so that their DNA has no boundaries; eukaryotic cells have a nuclear membrane. All cells, whether prokaryotic or eukaryotic, have a membrane that envelops the cell, separates its interior from the outside environment, regulates the movement of substances in and out of the cell, and maintains the cell's electrical potential. Inside the membrane, the cytoplasm makes up most of the cell's volume. All cells have DNA, the material that carries genes, as well as RNA, which contains the information needed to build various proteins such as enzymes, which are the main machinery of the cell.

Although more than 99 percent of all species that have ever lived on this planet are thought to have become extinct, there are currently between two million and one trillion species living on Earth. Information about the early development of life also draws input from a variety of fields, including geology and planetary science. These sciences provide information about Earth's history and the changes brought about by life. However, much of the information about the early phases of the Earth has been destroyed by geological processes over time. All organisms are descended from a common ancestor or from an ancestral gene pool. Evidence of common descent can be found in the similarities between all living organisms. In Darwin's day, evidence of similarity in traits was based solely on observations of morphological similarities, such as the fact that all birds have wings, even those that don't fly. There is strong genetic evidence that all organisms share a common ancestor. For example, every living cell uses nucleic acids as its genetic material, and uses the same 20 amino acids as the building blocks of proteins. All organisms use the same genetic code (with some very rare and minor deviations) to translate nucleic acid sequences into proteins.",

A small number of studies have concluded differently, namely that the roots of life reside in the bacterial domain, both within the phylum Firmicutes and that the phylum Chloroflexi forms the basis of a clade with Archaea and Eukaryotes and other bacterial remnants, as proposed by Thomas Cavalier-Smith. Research published in 2016, by William F. Martin, by genetically analyzing 6.1 million protein-coding genes from prokaryotic genome sequences from various phylogenetic trees, managed to identify 355 protein groups among 286,514 protein groups that may be common to LUCA.

However, this identification of the genes present in LUCA has been criticized, arguing that many of the proteins assumed to be present in LUCA are the result of later horizontal gene transfer between archaea and bacteria. Sexual reproduction is widespread among today's eukaryotes and probably also among the last common ancestors. This is demonstrated by the discovery of a single set of genes for meiosis in the descendants of earlier branching lineages on the eukaryotic evolutionary tree. This finding is supported by evidence that eukaryotes previously thought to be \"ancient asexuals\", such as the ameba, may have reproduced sexually in the past, and that most of today's asexual ameboid lineages probably emerged only recently independently. In prokaryotes, bacterial transformation naturally involves the transfer of DNA from one bacterium to another and the integration of the donor DNA into the recipient chromosome through recombination. Natural bacterial transformation is considered a primitive sexual process and occurs in bacteria and archaea, although it has been studied mainly in bacteria. Transformation is a way bacteria adapt and does not happen by chance, because this process depends on many gene products that interact specifically with each other to reach a state of natural competence to carry out this complex process. Transformation is a common way of moving DNA between prokaryotes. Traditionally, the ancestry of living organisms is reconstructed from morphology, but increasingly it is complemented by phylogenetics, namely phylogeny reconstruction by comparing genetic (DNA) sequences.",

If the number of amino acids is still below 50 molecules it is called a peptide, but if more than 50 molecules it is called a protein. Amino acids are linked together by peptide bonds. A peptide bond occurs when the nitrogen atom in one amino acid binds to the carboxyl group of another amino acid. An example of a peptide formed from alanine and glycine is alaniglycine, where the name describes the formation of a peptide bond. Peptides are present in every living thing and play a role in several biochemical activities. Peptides can be enzymes, hormones, antibiotics, and receptors. Peptide synthesis is carried out by combining the carboxyl group of one amino acid with the amine group of another amino acid. Peptide synthesis starts from the C-terminus (carboxyl group) to the N-terminus (amine group), as it occurs naturally in organisms. However, to synthesize peptides, it is not as easy as mixing amino acids just like that. For example: mixing glutamine (E) and serine (S) can produce E-S, S-E, S-S, E-E, and even polypeptides such as E-S-S-E-E. To avoid uncontrolled binding of amino acids, it is necessary to protect and control the peptide bonds that will occur so that bonds formed as desired. The steps of peptide synthesis are as follows: the amino acid is added a protective group. Then the protected amino acids are dissolved in a solvent such as dimethylformamide (DMF) which is combined with the coupling reagents and is pumped through the synthesis column. The protective group is removed from the amino acid by a deprotection reaction. Then the deprotecting reagent is removed to create a clean atmosphere of coalescence. Coupling reagents, for example N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCI), aid in peptide bond formation. After the coupling reaction is formed, the coupling reagents are washed to create a clean deprotection atmosphere.",

Pantun is a form of old poetry. Pantun was originally an oral literature, but now there are also written rhymes. Another feature of a rhyme is that it does not give the name of the composer (anonymous). This is because the distribution of rhymes is done orally. Indonesia has a very diverse wealth of verbal arts. A generally unwritten tradition of expressive utterances, and often witty content called \"pantun\" is a traditional art that can be found commonly in most Malay areas throughout the Indonesian archipelago. Some \"pantun\" performances are narrative in nature; For example, the \"kentrung\" tradition in Central and East Java, uses the \"rhyme\" structure to tell stories of religious history or local history to the accompaniment of drums. In essence, much of Indonesian traditional literature forms the basis for complex mixed genre performances, such as \"randai\" from the Minangkabau region of West Sumatra, which mixes music, dance, drama, and martial arts in a spectacular ceremonial fusion. As a means of maintaining language, pantun acts as a guardian of the function of words and the ability to maintain the flow of thought. Pantun trains someone to think about the meaning of words before speaking.",

Among today's youth, the ability to rhyme is usually valued. Pantun shows a person's speed in thinking and playing with words. However, in general the social role of pantun is as a means of reinforcing the delivery of messages. The closeness of social values \u200b\u200band pantun even starts from the philosophy of the pantun itself. Traditional rhyming, abstinence from chanting is a philosophy attached to rhymes. This proverb indicates that poetry is closely related to social values \u200b\u200band not just imagination. The spirit of the essence of rhymes becomes a guide to rhymes. This explanation confirms the function of pantun as a guard and cultural media to introduce and maintain community values. Meanwhile, in Minangkabau culture, rhymes are used in various traditional events. For example, in the manjapuik marapulai event (picking up the groom), batagak gala (title coronation ceremony), batagak penghulu (penghulu coronation ceremony), or in speeches at other traditional ceremonies. Pantun has a structure consisting of sampiran and content. Sampiran serves to prepare rhymes and rhythms that can help listeners understand the contents of the poem. In general, sampiran has no relation to the content, but sometimes it can give an idea of \u200b\u200bthe contents of the pantun. The content is the main part of the rhyme which contains the intent or thought to be conveyed by the rhyme maker. According to Sutan Takdir Alisjahbana, the function of sampiran is to prepare rhymes and rhythms so that listeners can easily understand the contents of the pantun. This is understandable because basically, pantun is oral literature. The pattern of rhyme and rhythm in pantun explicitly emphasizes the orality of pantun in Malay culture. General rules apply to rhymes, just like old poetry.",

Religious rhymes are rhymes that contain life advice based on religious understanding. This type of rhyme gives advice so that oneself and the listener always act well in life. Humorous rhymes are rhymes that aim to amuse those who hear them, sometimes used as a medium to satirize each other in an atmosphere full of intimacy so as not to cause offense. With limericks, it is hoped that the atmosphere will become more cheerful and happy. Heroic rhymes are rhymes whose content is related to the spirit of heroism. Romance poetry contains the expression of a person's heart about his feelings for another person, namely the person who is in his heart. Often these rhymes also contain jokes about people who are in love. Pantun proverbs use various proverbs, idioms, and proverbs in conveying their meaning. Therefore, the words conveyed cannot be interpreted literally. This type of rhyme expresses the feeling of loss of the speaker of the rhyme due to being abandoned by someone he loves. It could also be that the pantun contains the hope that the speaker and the listener can meet again. Riddle rhymes, as the name implies, provide a riddle for the listener to solve.

As with other related geological periods, for example the soil layers that define the start and end of this period are well identified, but the exact dates are uncertain by 5-10 million years. The beginning of the Silurian period is dated to a major extinction event (the Ordovician-Silurric extinction event) when 60% of marine species died out. In the early Silurian period, the dominant faunal community came from the Pentamerus group, namely the large-shelled brachiopods (lamp shells) of the species Pentamerus oblongus. This community is known to live in water areas exposed to sunlight because they are associated with strong green, calcareous algae. The waters it occupies are areas with stable wave activity and are not too shallow, because the pentamerid brachiopods will lose their pedicles as they mature. The pentamerid community thrives at depths of perhaps 30 to 60 meters (100 to 200 feet). In this period (some other references say it occurred in the Ordovician period), for the first time, non-microbial living things came to land, in the form of moss colonies that grew near moist and wet areas such as rivers and lakes. Then followed by arthropods such as millipedes and scorpions. The fossil record of sea scorpions peaked in the middle Silurian period, about 430 million years ago. The oldest fossil records of vascular plants also date to the middle Silurian period, with Cooksonia (originating from the Northern Hemisphere) and Baragwanathia (from Australia) being representatives.

Some fractals can be broken into several parts that are all similar to the original fractal. Fractals are said to have infinite detail and can have a self-similar structure at different magnification levels. In many cases, a fractal can be generated by repeating a pattern, usually in a recursive or iterative process. The English word for fractal is fractal. The term fractal was coined by Beno\u00eet Mandelbrot in 1975 from the Latin word fractus which means \"broken\", \"broken\", or \"irregular\". Before Mandelbrot introduced the term, the common name for such structures (eg Koch's snowflakes) was monster curves. Various types of fractals were originally studied as mathematical objects. Fractal geometry is a branch of mathematics that studies the properties and behavior of fractals. Fractals can help explain many situations that are difficult to describe using classical geometry, and have considerable applications in computer science, technology, and art. In the past, fractal conceptual ideas emerged when traditional definitions of Euclidean geometry and calculus failed to analyze these monster curved objects. Things that are now called fractals were discovered and studied long before the word fractal appeared. In 1872 Karl Theodor Wilhelm Weierstrass discovered an example of a function with the unintuitive property of being continuous everywhere but not differentiable anywhere \u2014 the graph of that function would be called a fractal today. In 1904 Helge von Koch, dissatisfied with Weierstrass' highly abstract and analytical definition, gave a more geometric definition for a similar function, now called Koch's snowflake. The idea of \u200b\u200bself-similar curves was further developed by Paul Pierre L\u00e9vy, who introduced a new fractal curve called the L\u00e9vy C curve in his 1938 article Plane or Space Curves and Surfaces Consisting of Parts Similar to the Whole.",

The function of iteration in complex fields was investigated in the late 19th and early 20th centuries by Henri Poincar\u00e9, Felix Klein, Pierre Fatou, and Gaston Julia. But without the aid of modern computer graphics, they cannot see the visual beauty of the objects they find. In trying to understand things like Cantor sets, mathematicians such as Constantin Carath\u00e9odory and Felix Hausdorff generalized the intuitive concept of dimensions to allow for non-integer values. This was part of a movement in the first half of the twentieth century aimed at creating descriptive set theory, i.e. a continuation of Cantor's research direction which could classify sets of points in Euclidean space. Hausdorff's definition of dimensions is geometric in nature, although it is based on tools from mathematical analysis. This approach was used by several people including Besicovitch, who differed from the logical investigations that built up much of the descriptive set theory of the 1920s and 1930s. Both fields were explored for some time afterward, mainly by specialists. In the 1960s Beno\u00eet Mandelbrot began investigating self-similarity in his writings such as How Long Is the Coast of Britain? Statistical Self-Similarity and Fractional Dimension. His investigation was a development of Lewis Fry Richardson's research. With a highly visual approach, Mandelbrot drew connections from previously unrelated mathematical topics. In 1975, Mandelbrot used the word fractal to describe self-similar objects that have no clear dimensions. He derived the word fractal from the Latin word fractus which means \"broken\", \"broken\", or \"irregular\". The word fractal is not derived from the word fractional, as many people believe.",

Once computer visualization is applied to fractal geometry, powerful visual arguments can be presented to show that fractal geometry connects many fields of mathematics and science, much larger and broader than previously thought. The fields connected by fractal geometry are mainly nonlinear dynamics, chaos theory and complexity. One example is drawing Newton's method as a fractal which apparently shows that the boundaries between different solutions are fractals and the solutions themselves are odd attractors. Fractal geometry has also been used for data compression and for modeling complex geological and organic systems, such as tree growth and river valley development. Fractals can be grouped into three broad categories. The following groupings are based on the way they are defined or created. Fractals can also be grouped based on self-similarity. There are three levels of self-similarity to fractals: It should be noted that not all self-similar objects are fractals \u2014 for example real lines (straight Euclidean lines) are self-similar, but the argument that Euclid's things are fractals is in the minority. Mandelbrot argued that a definition of \"fractal\" should include not only \"true\" fractals, but also traditional Euclidean objects, because irrational numbers on the number line have complex, non-repeating properties. Because fractals have infinite detail, no natural object is a fractal. However, on a limited scale, natural objects can show their fractal properties. The characteristics of fractals, while easy to understand intuitively, are in fact very difficult to define mathematically. Mandelbrot defines a fractal as \"a set whose Hausdorff Besicovitch dimension is greater than its topological dimension\". For an exactly self-similar fractal, the Hausdorff dimension is the same as the Minkowsi Bouligand dimension.",

Its recursive nature is easy to see \u2014 take a branch of a tree and it will appear that that branch is a miniature of the tree as a whole (not exactly the same, but similar). A relatively simple example is the Cantor set, in which shorter and shorter open intervals are spread over the basic interval , 1], leaving a set that may be self-similar, and may have dimension d that satisfies 0 < d < 1. A simple recipe, namely removes the digit 7 from the decimal expansion, resulting in a self-similar Cantor set at a 10-fold magnification. In general, fractals are irregular in shape (not smooth), so they are not objects defined by traditional geometry. This means that fractals tend to have significant detail, visible at any scale; when there are self-similarities, this can happen because zooming in on the fractal shows a similar image. These sets are usually defined by recursion. For comparison, take an ordinary Euclidean object, such as a circle. The curve of the circle will appear flatter if it is enlarged. At infinite magnification it is no longer possible to tell the difference between a curved circle and a straight line. Fractals are not like this. The conventional idea of \u200b\u200bcurvature, which is a reciprocal of the radius of the approximating circle, cannot be used. On fractals, increasing the magnification will reveal detail that wasn't visible before. Some common examples of fractals are the Mandelbrot set, Lyapunov fractal, Cantor set, Sierpinski triangle, Sierpinski carpet, Menger sponge, dragon curve, Peano curve, and Koch curve.

It reviews various matters concerning soil formation (pedogenesis), soil morphology (physical and chemical properties and characteristics), and soil classification. The term is borrowed from the English pedology, which is formed from two Greek words: pedon (\"soil\") and logos (\"symbol\", \"knowledge\"). Pedology is one of the two main branches of soil science, besides edaphology (the science of soil fertility). Soil classification has various versions. There are technical difficulties in classifying soils because many factors influence soil formation. In addition, soil is a dynamic object, so it is always undergoing a process of change. Soil is formed from worn/weathered rock due to exposure to dynamics in the lower layers of the atmosphere, such as climate dynamics, topography/geography, and the activity of biological organisms. The intensity and time intervals of these factors also result in variations in the appearance of the soil. In classifying soil, experts first do it based on physical and chemical characteristics, as well as by looking at the layers that make up the soil profile. Furthermore, after the technology has developed far, the experts also look at aspects of the bedrock that forms the soil and the weathering process of the rocks which then gives certain characteristics to the soil that is formed. Based on these criteria, there are many types of soil in the world. To make it easier, experts often classify locally. For Indonesia, for example, the Dudal-Soepraptohardjo (1957-1961) classification system is known, which is still referred to today in Indonesia for agricultural purposes, especially in a modified version by the Center for Soil and Agro-climate Research (Puslittanak) in 1978 and 1982.

However, the USDA system is helpful because it uses a consistent naming system. For communication among world soil experts, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has also developed a soil classification system since 1974. In 1998 it was agreed to use the WRB classification system from the World Reference Base for Soil Resources, a project formed by FAO, to replace the system this. The latest version of the WRB system was released in 2007. Soil taxonomy based on the Dudal-Soepraptohardjo system is based on the appearance of the soil profile and a number of physical and chemical characteristics. The basis of this system is that of Rudi Dudal, a soil expert from Belgium, who was modified for the Indonesian situation by M. Soepraptohardjo. This system is preferred by agricultural field workers because it is easy to implement in the field. The original version was released in 1957. Modifications were made by the Center for Soil Research in 1978 and 1982.

The Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church broke off from each other in the East\u2013West Schism in 1054, while Protestant Christians emerged during the 16th century reformation as a breakaway from the Catholic Church. Early Christians who were Jewish by nationality called themselves followers of the way (Greek: \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u1f41\u03b4\u03bf\u1fe6, t\u00eas hodo\u00fb), possibly referring to the passage of Isaiah 40:3, \"prepare in the desert the way for the Lord.\" note 4] Based on the text of the Acts of the Apostles 11:26, the term \"Christians\" (Greek: \u03a7\u03c1\u1fd1\u03c3\u03c4\u1fd0\u1fb1\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2, Kr\u012bsti\u0101n\u00f3s) means \"followers of Christ\", referring to Jesus' disciples, and was first used in the city of Antioch by non-Jews.

The concept of the Messiah in Christianity is fundamentally different from the concept of the Messiah in Judaism. The essence of the Christian belief is that by believing in and accepting the death and resurrection of Jesus, sinful humanity can be reconciled with God, and thus obtain the offer of salvation and the promise of eternal life. Although there were various theological views regarding the nature of Jesus in the early centuries of Christian religious history, Christians generally believed that Jesus was God incarnate and was \"truly God and fully human\" (or fully divine and fully human).

Some modern scholars use the belief of Jesus' followers in his resurrection as a starting point in establishing continuity between the figure of Jesus as a historical figure and the figure of Jesus in the early Church's message. A class of liberal Christians do not recognize the literal physical resurrection, and regard the history of Jesus' resurrection as merely a myth rich in symbols and beneficial for spiritual growth. Arguments regarding belief in the death and resurrection of Jesus appear in many religious debates and interfaith dialogues. The Apostle Paul, one of the early converts and missionaries of Christianity, once wrote that \"if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain and your belief is in vain\" (1 Corinthians 15:14). Like the pagan Jews and Romans of his day, the Apostle Paul believed that sacrifices had the effect of creating new kinship bonds, purifying, and bringing eternal life. For Paul, the necessary sacrifice was the death of Jesus. Other nations, which through the sacrifice of Jesus' life have become \"the property of Christ\", are also Abraham's descendants and \"have the right to receive God's promise\", just like the Israelites (Galatians 3:29).

The Catholic Church teaches that salvation cannot exist without loyalty on the part of Christians; those who have repented and want to become followers of Christ must live according to the principles of charity, and should be baptized. Martin Luther taught that baptism is necessary for salvation, but the Lutheran church and other Protestant churches in modern times tend to teach that salvation is a gift that a person obtains by God's grace, which is sometimes defined as \"mercy without merit\". even outside of baptism.

Some Christians also believe that God appears as the Father in the Old Testament, appears as the Son in the New Testament, and appears as the Holy Spirit in the present, but God is still present in these three periods as three persons. Nevertheless, there is a traditional Christian belief that it is the Son who appears in the Old Testament, because when the Trinity is depicted in fine art, the Son is usually depicted with a special feature, namely with a cross marked with a cross symbolizing Christ, and a figure with this feature is shown as the likeness of God in the depiction of the Garden of Eden, namely the figure of God's incarnation that only manifested itself at a later date. On a number of early Christian sarcophagi, the figure of the Logos is characterized by a beard, \"which gives him the appearance of being aged, even pre-embodied (predating his time).\" The Trinity is an essential doctrine of mainstream Christianity. Long before the Nicene Creed was formulated in 325 AD, Christianity had taught the mystery of the triune nature of God as an expression of normative faith. According to Roger E. Olson and Christopher Hall, through prayer, meditation, study and practice, the Christian community concluded \"that God must exist as a singleness as well as a trinity\", and promulgated this conclusion in the ecumenical councils of the late 4th century.",

        "paragraph": "According to this doctrine, God is not divided in the sense that each person is a third of the whole being of God; on the contrary, each person is considered as the whole God (read perikoresis). The difference lies in interpersonal relationships, the Father has no source; The Son is begotten by the Father; The Holy Spirit comes out of the Father and (in Western Church theology) from the Son. Despite their different relationships, each of these \"persons\" is eternal and omnipotent. Christian sects such as Unitarian Universalism, the Jehovah's Witnesses, the Mormon Church, and other sects do not adhere to such Trinitarianisms. The Latin word \"trias\", the origin of the word \"trinitas\", which is translated into Indonesian as \"trinity\", first appears in the writings of Theophilus of Antioch. Theophilus wrote about the \"Trinity of God (the Father), His Word (the Son), and His Wisdom (the Holy Spirit)\". This term may have been used before the time of Theophilus. After Theophilus, this word appears again in the writings of Tertullian. In the following century, the word became commonly used, and appears frequently in Origen's writings. Trinitarianism or trinitarianism is a term for Christians who believe in the concept of the trinity. Almost all Christian denominations adhere to the trinitarianism. Although the word \"trinity\" is not found in the Bible, theologians have been developing this term and concept since the 3rd century to make it easier for people to understand New Testament teachings about God as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Since then, Christian theologians have carefully emphasized that the trinity does not mean there are three Gods (the anti-trinitarian heresy of Tritheism), nor does it mean that each hypostasis of the Trinity is one third of the one infinite God (partialism heresy), nor does it mean The Son and the Holy Spirit are created beings whose rank is below the Father (Arianism heresy).",

Antitrinitarianism or antitrinitarianism (or nontrinitarianism) refers to a theology that rejects the doctrine of the Trinity. Various anti-trinitarian views, such as adoptionism or modalism, have emerged since the early history of Christianity, and have been a trigger for disputes over Christology. Anti-trinitarianism reappeared in the 11th to 13th centuries in Catharian gnosticism, in the 16th century in unitarian congregations formed during the Protestant Reformation, in the 18th century Enlightenment, and in the 19th century. -19 among the Protestant congregations formed during the Second Great Awakening. Just like other religions, Christianity also has various adherents with various beliefs and interpretations of the Scriptures. In Christianity, the collection of canonical books, namely the Old Testament and the New Testament, is believed to be the inspired Word of God. According to this traditional view of inspiration, God worked in such a way through human poets that these poets could write down what God wanted to reveal. The Greek word in 2 Timothy 3:16 that refers to this divine inspiration is theopneustos, which literally means \"God-breathed.\" Some believe that divine inspiration made the Bible that exists today inerrant. Others believe that the Bible is inerrant in only the original manuscripts, although none of the original manuscripts of the Bible have survived to this day. There are also those who believe that only the Bible in certain translations is free from errors, for example the King James Version of the Bible. Another view that is closely related to this belief is the infallibility of the Bible or the limited inerrancy of the Bible, namely the view that the Bible is free from error as a guide to salvation, but may contain errors regarding certain matters such as history, geography. , or science.",

The variations in the list of books that are considered authentic are a reflection of the range of traditions and councils that have been held in relation to this matter. Each version of the Old Testament Scriptures list always contains the Tanak (Torah-Prophets-Books), that is, the Hebrew Bible or a collection of books considered authentic by the Jewish people. In addition to the Tanak group, the Catholic and Orthodox Churches consider the Deuterocanonical library group (the second authentic group) as authentic books and worthy of being part of the Old Testament Scriptures. The Deuterocanonical books are contained in the Septuagint Bible (the first translation of the Jewish Bible in Greek), but are considered apocryphal (weak) by Protestants. Nevertheless, these books are considered important historical documents, which can help people understand the vocabulary, grammar, and sentence structure that were commonly used at the time they were written. Some published versions of the Bible contain Deuterocanonical books and parts of authentic books that are considered apocryphal among Protestants in a separate section between the Old Testament and the New Testament. The New Testament group of Scriptures, written in Koine Greek (market Greek), consists of 27 books recognized as authentic by all Christian denominations. Modern studies have raised various issues related to the Bible. Although praised by many English speakers for its stunning prose, the King James Version of the Bible was actually translated from Erasmus' Greek Bible compiled \"on the basis of a single 12th-century copy, one of the worst extant there until now\".",

Another issue that has also been raised is the notion that a number of books contain false verses. The encouragement to women to \"keep quiet and be submissive\" in 1 Timothy 2 is suspected by many to be a forged verse that one of Paul's followers infiltrated into the Bible. Similar verses in 1 Corinthians 14, which are thought to have been composed by Paul, appear in different places in different texts, and are thought to have been originally marginal notes made by a scribe. Other verses in 1 Corinthians, such as 1 Corinthians 11:2\u201316 which encourage women to cover their hair \"when praying or prophesying,\" actually contradict the advice for them to keep quiet during worship. The final issue regarding the Bible is how to select the books for inclusion in the New Testament collection of Scriptures. Other gospels have been found, such as those found near Nag Hamm\u00e2di in 1945, and although some of these passages differ from those commonly used by Christians, it should be understood that some of the material from these newly discovered gospels it is very likely that it dates from the same time, or even predates the writing of the New Testament gospels. The core texts of the Gospel of Thomas, in particular, are thought to have been written as early as AD 50 (although some scholars dispute the initial date of the writing of the Gospel of Thomas), and if so, this gospel could offer a new perspective on examine the gospel passages that underlie the canonical gospels, namely the passages found in the Gospel of Luke 1:1\u20132.",

Scholars are currently exploring the relationship in the early Church between mystical speculation and experience on the one hand, and efforts to search for Church order on the other hand, by examining newly discovered texts, by examining the canonical texts more closely. and by examining the stages through which the New Testament Scriptures attain canonical status. There were two schools of exegesis (interpretation of sacred texts) that arose and flourished in Antiquity, one in Alexandria and another in Antioch. The Alexandrian interpretation, as exemplified by Origen, tended to examine the figurative meaning (implied meaning) of Bible verses, while the Antiochene interpretation examined the literal meaning (literal meaning), in the belief that the other meanings (called theoria) were only acceptable if it is based on a literal meaning. Catholic theology distinguishes the meaning contained in Bible verses into two kinds, namely the literal meaning and the spiritual meaning. The literal meaning is the meaning of the words used in the composition of the holy verses, while the spiritual meaning is still differentiated into: With regard to exegesis, according to the guidelines for correct interpretation, Catholic theology confirms that: Protestant Christians believe that the Bible is self-help revelation , the supreme authority over all Christian doctrine, and uncovers all the truths necessary for salvation.",

        "paragraph": "This belief is known as sola scriptura. It is characteristic of Protestants to believe that lay people are able to adequately understand Scripture, either because Scripture itself is clear (or \"straightforward\"), with the help of the Holy Spirit, or because of both. Martin Luther believed that without God's help, the Scriptures would be \"shrouded in darkness\". He wanted \"a definitive and simple understanding of Scripture.\" John Calvin once wrote that \"whoever does not reject the guidance of the Holy Spirit will find light in the Scriptures.\" The Second Helvetic Creed, compiled by the pastor of the Calvinist congregation in Z\u00fcrich (successor of Hulderikus Zwingli), was adopted as a doctrinal proclamation by most of the Calvinist congregations in Europe. Protestants emphasize the meaning of the words contained in the Bible. This method of interpretation which emphasizes the meaning of words in holy verses is called the historical-grammatical method (the historical-grammar method). The historical-grammatical method is an attempt in the field of Biblical Hermeneutics (the science of Bible interpretation) to discover the original meaning and true intent of the Scriptures. The original meaning and true intent of the text of the Scriptures is obtained through the study of the verses in terms of grammar and sentence structure, historical background, literary variety, and theological considerations (Bible canon). The historical-grammatical method distinguishes between an original meaning and an important meaning of a biblical text. The significance of a Bible passage includes the use or application of that passage. Bible verses are considered to have only one meaning or single meaning. As stated by Milton S. Terry, \"one of the basic principles of grammatical-historical exposition is that words and sentences only have one significance in the same connection. If we ignore this principle, at the same time we drift away in a sea of \u200b\u200buncertainty and guesswork.\"",

        "paragraph": "Clearly, the method of historical-grammatical interpretation is different from determining the significance of a verse being interpreted. Taken together, the two form the meaning of the term biblical hermeneutics. A number of Protestant commentators use a typological approach. The discussion of the end of everything, be it the end of every human life, the end of time, or the end of the world, is basically Christian eschatology, namely the study of human destiny as revealed in the Bible. The main topics in Christian eschatology are the great tribulation, death and the afterlife, the rapture, the second coming of Jesus, the resurrection of the dead, heaven and hell, millennialism (belief in the thousand year kingdom), the final judgment, the last day, and heaven. new and new earth. Christians believe that the second coming of Christ will occur at the end of time, after a period of great persecution (the great tribulation). Everyone who has died will be physically resurrected from the dead to undergo the final judgment. Jesus will establish the complete Kingdom of God to fulfill the prophecies in the Scriptures. Most Christians believe that humanity will face a divine court and be rewarded with eternal life or eternal damnation. This belief in a divine court includes belief in a general judgment for all mankind when the dead are raised, as well as belief (adhered to by Catholic, Orthodox, and most Protestant denominations) in a special judgment for each soul when the person concerned experiences physical death. In Catholic teaching, people who die in a state of grace, that is, without mortal sin separating them from God but not yet completely clean from the consequences of sin, will be purified in purgatory (the realm of purification) so that they achieve holiness and deserve to enter God's presence. People who have attained holiness are called saints.",
