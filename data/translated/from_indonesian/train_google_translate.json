This term is probably first used by Pythagoras (c. 570\u2013495SM). The methods used in philosophy include asking questions, critical discussion, dialectics, and systematic presentations. Classical philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know everything and prove it? What's the most real? Philosophers also ask more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be fair or unfair (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will? Historically, philosophy encompasses the core of all knowledge. From the time of Ancient Greek philosophers such as Aristotle until the 19th century, natural philosophy encompassed astronomy, medicine, and physics. For example, Newton's Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy in 1687 is later classified as a physics book. In the 19th century, the development of modern university research ushered in professionalized and specialized academic philosophy and other disciplines. In the modern era, several investigations that were traditionally part of philosophy have become separate academic disciplines, some of which are psychology, sociology, linguistics, and economics. Other investigations closely related to art, science, politics and several other fields remained part of philosophy. For example, is beauty objective or subjective? Are there many scientific methods or is there only one? Is political utopia a hopeful dream or a vain delusion? The main sub-fields of academic philosophy include metaphysics (dealing with the nature of reality and being), epistemology (concerning \"the origins and fields of knowledge and] ... their limits and validity\" ), ethics, aesthetics, political philosophy, logic, philosophy of science , and the history of western philosophy.",

This last form is more similar to the original. In Indonesian a person who studies philosophy is called a \"philosopher\". knowledge. In this sense, philosophy is closely related to religion, mathematics, natural science, education, and politics. \"Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy\", Newton's work in 1687 was classified in the 2000s as a physics book; he used the term \"philosophy nature\" because the term was used to cover disciplines later associated with science such as astronomy, medicine, and physics. In classical times, Philosophy t is traditionally divided into three main branches: This division is not obsolete but has changed. Natural philosophy has divided into various natural sciences, especially astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology, and cosmology. Moral philosophy has given birth to the social sciences, but still includes value theory (including aesthetics, ethics, political philosophy, etc.). Metaphysical philosophy has given birth to formal sciences such as logic, mathematics and philosophy of science, but still includes epistemology, cosmology and others.",

Chalmers and others, on the other hand, see progress in philosophy as similar to progress in science. Meanwhile Talbot Brewer argues that \"progress\" is an erroneous standard by which to judge philosophical activity. In one general sense, philosophy is associated with wisdom, intellectual culture, and the pursuit of knowledge. In this regard, all literate cultures and societies ask philosophical questions such as \"how do we live\" and \"what is the nature of reality\". A broad and impartial conception of philosophy thus leads to a rational investigation of such questions as reality, morality and life in all world civilizations. Western philosophy is the philosophical tradition of the Western world and originates from Pre-Socratic thinkers who were active in ancient Greece in the 6th century BC. such as Thales (c. 624-546 BC) and Pythagoras (c. 570-495 BC) who practiced \"love of wisdom\" (philosophia) and were also called physiologoi (students of physis, or nature). Socrates was a very influential philosopher, who insisted that he had no wisdom but was a pursuer of it. Western philosophy can be divided into three eras: Ancient (Greco-Roman), Medieval philosophy (Christian Europe), and modern philosophy. The ancient era was dominated by the teachings of Greek philosophy that arose from some of Socrates' students, such as Plato who founded the Platonic Academy. Plato is one of the most influential Greek thinkers in all of Western thought. Plato's student Aristotle was also very influential, he founded the Peripatetic School. Other traditions include Cynicism, Stoicism, Greek Skepticism and Epicureanism. Important topics covered by the Greeks included metaphysics (with competent theories such as atomism and monism), cosmology, the nature of good life (eudaimonia), the possibility of knowledge and the nature of reason (logos).",

Medieval philosophy (5th - 16th centuries) was the period after the fall of the western Roman empire and was dominated by the rise of Christianity and therefore reflected Judeo-Christian theological concerns while also maintaining continuity with Greco-Roman thought. Issues such as the existence and nature of God, the nature of faith and reason, metaphysics, the problem of evil are discussed in this period. Some of the major thinkers of the Middle Ages include St. Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, Boethius, Anselm and Roger Bacon. Philosophy for these thinkers is seen as a support for theology (ancilla theologiae) and because of that they try to harmonize their philosophy with their interpretation of the scriptures. This period sparked the development of Scholasticism, a text-critical method developed in medieval universities based on the close reading and debate of key texts. The Renaissance period (1355-1650) saw more of an increased focus on classical Greco-Roman thought and the strong influence of humanism. Early modern philosophy in the Western world began with thinkers such as Thomas Hobbes and Ren\u00e9 Descartes (1596-1650). Following the development of the natural sciences, modern philosophy focused more on developing a rational and secular foundation of knowledge, moving away from traditional structures of authority such as religion, scholastic thought and the Church. Major modern philosophers include Spinoza, Leibniz, Locke, Berkeley, Hume, and Kant. Nineteenth-century philosophy was influenced by a wider movement called the Enlightenment, and included figures such as Hegel, a key figure in German idealism, Kierkegaard, who developed the foundations for existentialism, Nietzsche, a famous anti-Christian, JS Mill, who promoted Utilitarianism, Karl Marx who developed the foundations for Communism and the American William James. The 20th century witnessed the split between analytic philosophy and continental philosophy, as well as philosophical trends such as phenomenology, existentialism, logical positivism, pragmatism and linguistics.",

Early wisdom literature from this area was a school that sought to instruct people in ethical conduct, practical life and virtue through stories and proverbs. In Ancient Egypt these texts were known as sebayt (teachings) and they are very important to our understanding of Ancient Egyptian philosophy. Babylonian astronomy also includes many philosophical speculations about cosmology that may have influenced the Ancient Greeks. Jewish philosophy and Christian philosophy are religious-religious traditions that developed in both the Middle East and Europe, both having certain early Judaic texts (notably the Tanakh) and monotheistic beliefs. Jewish thinkers such as Geonim of the Talmudic Academy in Babylon and Maimonides were involved with Greek and Islamic philosophy. Later Jewish philosophy came under strong Western intellectual influence and included the works of Moses Mendelssohn which ushered in the Haskalah (the Jewish Enlightenment), Jewish existentialism and Reform Judaism. Pre-Islamic Iranian philosophy begins with the work of Zoroastrian, one of the first promoters of monotheism and the dualism of good and evil. This dualistic cosmogony later influenced the development of Iranian philosophies such as Manichaeism, Mazdakism, and Zurvanism. After the Muslim conquests, Early Islamic philosophy developed the Greek philosophical tradition in new innovative directions. This Islamic Golden Age influenced the intellectual development of Europe. The two main currents of early Islamic thought were the Kalam which focused on Islamic theology and the philosophy based on Aristotelianism and Neoplatonism. Aristotle's work was very influential among philosophers such as al-Kindi (9th century), Avicenna (980 - 10 June) and Ibn Rushd (12th century).",

Indian philosophy (Sanskrit: dar\u015bana; 'worldview', 'teaching') is a philosophical tradition originating in the Indian subcontinent. Indian philosophical traditions are generally classified as orthodox or heterodox - \u0101stika or n\u0101stika - depending on whether they accept the authority of the Vedas and whether they accept the theories of Brahman and Atman. The orthodox schools generally include Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Samkhya, Yoga, M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 and Vedanta, and the common heterodox schools include: Jains, Buddhists, Aj\u00f1ana, Ajivika and C\u0101rv\u0101ka. Some of the earliest surviving philosophical texts are the Upanishads of the Late Vedic period (1000-500 BC). Important Indian philosophical concepts include: dharma, karma, samsara, moksha and ahimsa. Indian philosophers developed a system of epistemological reasoning (pramana) and logic, the topics investigated included metaphysics, ethics, hermeneutics and soteriology. Indian philosophy also covers topics such as political philosophy as seen in Arthashastra c. 4th century BC, and the philosophy of love as seen in the Kama Sutra. Six commonly encountered orthodox schools emerged during the early General Era and the Gupta Empire. This Hindu school developed from \"synthetic Hinduism\" incorporating orthodox brahmanical and unorthodox elements from Buddhism and Jainism as a way of responding to unorthodox challenges.

The early modern era saw the rise of Hindu nationalism, the Hindu reform movement and Neo-Vedanta (or Hindu modernism) whose main supporters included Vivekananda, Mahatma Gandhi and Aurobindo and for the first time promoted the idea of \u200b\u200b\"one Hinduism\". Due to the influence of British colonialism, most modern Indian philosophical works are in English, including works by thinkers such as Radhakrishnan, Krishna Chandra Bhattacharya, Bimal Krishna Matilal and M. Hiriyanna. Buddhist philosophy begins with the thought of Gautama Buddha (between the sixth and fourth centuries BCE) and is preserved in early Buddhist texts. Buddhist thought is trans-regional and trans-cultural. This thought originated in India and then spread to East Asia, Tibet, Central Asia, and Southeast Asia, developing new and syncretic traditions in these different areas. Several schools of Buddhist thought are the dominant philosophical traditions in Tibet and Southeast Asian countries such as Sri Lanka and Burma. Since ignorance of the true nature of things is considered one of the roots of suffering (dukkha), Buddhist philosophy is concerned with epistemology, metaphysics, ethics and psychology. The ending of dukkha also includes the practice of meditation. Key innovative concepts include the Four Noble Truths, Anatta (not self) a critique of fixed personal identity, impermanence (Anicca), and a skepticism of metaphysical questions.

East Asian philosophical thought dates back to Ancient China, and Chinese philosophy began during the Western Zhou Dynasty and in the period following its fall, when the \"One Hundred Schools of Thought\" flourished (6th century to 221 BC). This period was marked by significant intellectual and cultural developments and the rise of China's main philosophical teachings, Confucianism, legalism, and Taoism, as well as many other less influential teachings. This philosophical tradition developed metaphysical, political and ethical theories such as Tao, Yin and Yang, Ren and Li which, along with Chinese Buddhism, directly influenced Korean philosophy, Vietnamese philosophy and Japanese philosophy (which also includes the original Shinto tradition). Buddhism began to arrive in China during the Han dynasty (206 BC-220 AD), through the gradual transmission of the Silk Road and through native influences that developed distinct forms of the Chinese language (such as Chan/Zen) that spread across East Asian cultures. During subsequent Chinese dynasties such as the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) and also in the Joseon dynasty (1392-1897) a revival of Neo-Confucianism led by thinkers such as Wang Yangming (1472-1529) became the predominant school of thought promoted by the imperial authorities.

Modern African thought studies a lot on Ethnophylosophy, by defining the meaning of African philosophy along with its unique characteristics and what it means to be African. During the 17th century, Ethiopian philosophy developed a strong literary tradition exemplified by Zera Yacob.

In Mesoamerica, Aztec philosophy was an intellectual tradition developed by individuals called Tlamatini ('those who know things') and whose ideas are preserved in various Aztec codices. The Aztec worldview put forward the concept of universal energy or universal power called Ometeotl which can be translated as \"Double Cosmic Energy\" and the search for ways to live in balance with a constantly changing \"crafty\" world. Teotl's theory can be seen as a form of Pantheism. Aztec philosophers developed the theory metaphysics, epistemology, values, and aesthetics. Aztec ethics was focused on seeking tlamatiliztli (knowledge, wisdom) based on moderation and balance in all actions as in the Nahua adage \"goodness in the middle is indispensable\".

(A philosopher might specialize in Kantian epistemology, platonic aesthetics, or modern political philosophy.) Also, these philosophical questions sometimes overlap with other questions such as science, religion or mathematics. Metaphysics is the study of the most general features of reality, such as existence, time, objects and their properties, the whole and its parts, events, processes and causes and effects, and the relationship between mind and body. Metaphysics includes cosmology, the study of the world as a whole and ontology, the study of reality. The main subject of debate is between realists, who argue that there are independent entities apart from their mental perceptions and idealism, who argue that reality is mentally or immaterially constructed. Metaphysics deals with the topic of identity. Essence is the set of attributes that make an object what it is and without essence the object loses its identity, while accidents are properties that belong to an object, without which the object can still retain its identity. Particulars are objects that are said to exist in space and time, as opposed to abstract objects, such as numbers, and universals, which are properties shared by some particular things, such as the reddish color of an object or its gender. The kind of existence (if any) of universal and abstract objects is a contentious issue in metaphysics. Epistemology is the study of knowledge (from the Greek episteme).

Value theory includes ethics, aesthetics, political philosophy, feminist philosophy, legal philosophy, and others. Ethics, or \"moral philosophy\", studies and considers good and bad behavior, right and wrong values, and good and evil. His main investigations include how to lead a good life and identifying moral standards. It also includes a meta-analysis of how best to live or related standards exist.

Aesthetics is \"a critical reflection of art, culture and nature.\" This branch of philosophy discusses the nature of art, beauty and taste, enjoyment, emotional values, perception and the creation and appreciation of beauty. Aesthetics, more precisely defined as the study of sensory matters or sensory-emotional values, is sometimes called the judgment of feelings and tastes.

Richard Feynman argued that the philosophy of a topic was irrelevant to his main research, saying that \"the philosophy of science is as useful to scientists as ornithology is to birds.\" Curtis White, on the other hand, argues that philosophical tools are essential to the humanities, science and social sciences. The topics of the philosophy of science are numbers, symbols and formal methods of reasoning as used in the social and natural sciences. Logic is the study of reasoning and argument. An argument is \"a series of connected statements intended to construct a proposition\". The series of connected statements is called the \"premise\" and the proposition is the conclusion. For example: Therefore, Socrates is mortal. (conclusion) Deductive reasoning is that when given certain premises, the conclusion is implied and inescapable. Inference rules are used to infer conclusions such as, modus ponens, where given \"A\" and \"If A then B\", then \"B\" must be inferred.

Saddened by the tendency for people to benefit from the goodness he taught, and seeking greater personal peace as he advanced in age, Laozi finally rode a buffalo and headed west, to what is now Tibet (Hankao Valley). Before leaving, there was a gatekeeper who tried to stop him from leaving. Because his efforts failed, he asked Laozi to leave a note regarding Laozi's views. Then Laozi stayed for three days, and after that he returned with a small book containing \u00b1 5000 Chinese characters entitled Dao De Jing. Laozi is also said to have lived in the same era as Confucius. However, by examining Daode Jing's book, it can be concluded that this is impossible, because there are some ideas that are not likely to be widely known at the time of Confucius. Most modern scholars state that Laozi lived \u00b1 2 centuries after Confucius. The core teaching of Taoism is \"Dao\" (\u9053) which means formless, invisible, but is the process of occurrence of all living things and all things that exist in the universe. The Dao that exists in the form of living things and other things is De (\u5fb7). The combination of Dao and De is known as Taoism which is the foundation of nature. Taoism is calm, unrequited, gentle as water, and eternal. Human immortality is realized when one attains Dao consciousness, and that person becomes a god.

This power is the source of millions of objects in the world. Every object in the universe, whether animate or inanimate, contains Yinyang, which complement each other to achieve balance. In terminology, Yin and Yang are translated as negative and positive. Every object is dualism which consists of positive elements and negative elements. Objects that do not have negative and positive elements, it means empty and empty. Like magnets, magnets have positive and negative elements, both of which are complementary. Magnets without positive elements, negative elements do not materialize. That means that a magnet will not exist if it does not have these two elements. Later Taoism had a strong emphasis on human harmony with the Dao and the universe. The Dao is seen as transcending all things, both human and natural, and at the same time it is also spread within this realm. In Taoism it is said that humans must live according to the ways of nature (Dao), understand its essence, and live in harmony with it. The true Dao cannot be named, nor can it be described in words. The true Dao can only be understood through human spiritual awareness. However, in order to make it easier for people to understand this Dao, the Dao must be explained in words. Dao is literally a \"path\" or \"path\". In order to better understand this \"way\", there are three meanings that can be learned: 1.

This first and fundamental meaning of the Dao can be known, only through a mystical awareness that cannot be explained in words. 2. Tao is the Way of the Universe Dao is transcendent but also immanent. The Dao is the driving force of this universe, that is, it is the rule, rhythm, and driving force of the entire universe, and it is also the governing principle that lies behind all that exists. Dao is a spirit that inhabits all nature, so it becomes a \"thing\" and is immanent. 3. Tao is the Way Humans Arrange Their Life Dao also gives instructions to humans regarding the life that humans should live so that it is in harmony with the way this universe works. This relates to other teachings and ethics of Taoism. The most popular Yin Yang symbol is the Xiantian Taiji (\u5148\u5929\u592a\u6975\u5716) or Yinyang Yu (\u9670\u967d\u9b5a) symbol introduced by Lai Zhide (\u4f86\u77e5\u5fb7; 1525~1604). The history of the study and development of the Yinyang symbol began during the Song dynasty until the 15th century. The other symbols of Taoism are Chentuan (\u9673\u6476) and Zhou Dunyi (\u5468\u6566\u9824), the popularity of these two symbols ranks after the popularity of the Xiantian Taiji symbol. The original symbol of Taoism was the coat of arms Wuji(\u7121\u6975\u5716) by Chentuan in the early Song Dynasty, later advanced by Chou Dunyi who introduced the symbol Taiji (\u592a\u6975\u5716).

According to the Wu-wei theory, one should limit one's activities to what is necessary and what is natural or natural. As in achieving a certain goal, don't overdo it or make any effort at will. In doing this deed, one should take moderation as the guiding principle of life, for human beings have too many desires and too much knowledge. They seek happiness by fulfilling their desires. However, when they try to fulfill too many desires, they get the opposite result. Wu-wei is life lived without tension. Wu-wei is the pure embodiment of gentleness, simplicity, and freedom; an effective, pure ability in which no movement is wasted just to show it off. If Wu-wei is seen from the outside, one can see that he is helpless, because he is never pushy and never looks tense. The secret here lies in the way it seeks out the empty spaces in life and nature and moves through these. Chuang Tzu explains this with his story of a butcher whose knife had not been dull for twenty years. When pressed to explain his secret, the butcher replied, \u201cFrom between the bones at every joint there is always a space. Otherwise, of course there would be no movement. By seeking out this space and passing through it my cleaver lays wide the bones without touching them.\u201d The natural phenomenon most similar to the Tao in the view of Taoists is water.

According to the view of Taoism, human life has been outlined by 'sky'. Humans have their own way. What man has to do is only research that path and follow that trail without trying to impose his narrow views, and without the will to deviate from nature for personal gain. Such an attitude is called Wu Wei, which means not interfering. Wu-wei can also be interpreted as 'not willing'. Humans in the view of Taoism, must eliminate their desires, and follow the course of natural processes without interfering with those processes. According to Taoism, if humans become arrogant and do things beyond their capabilities, then one day he will be reproached which can make him grieve or suffer. Therefore, a sage who knows the Dao and the laws of nature would choose to resign and reject any honors bestowed upon him. He chose to keep a low profile. However, Taoism does not teach that one must get rid of all possessions to achieve inner peace. The thing that needs to be thrown away is the feeling of attachment to the treasure. If wealth is thrown away but there is still attachment to it, then it is in vain. Therefore, get rid of attachment to property from human beings, and property must be used for social purposes.

A good human being is one who is able to follow the course of the universe according to the Dao. If a human had successfully followed the path of the Dao, then he would not have to fear death. Death is a natural process and humans cannot fight nature, therefore humans do not need to be afraid or anxious about death. Death only returns man to the Dao. In living an existing life, humans lead to a natural life without any interfering process. This natural life becomes a basic virtue that triggers the emergence of three other virtues that guide humans in their life, namely meekness, humility, and self-denial. Meekness is a friend of life, on the other hand, hardness and rigidity are friends of death. Humility is the attitude of being able to limit oneself by doing only what is necessary. In the Daode Ching it says, \u201cThere is no greater curse than to be dissatisfied. There is no greater sin than always wanting to have.\u201d Then self-denial is an attitude of considering oneself and human life only as a loan from the universe to humans. Therefore, humans who are wise and want to live a quiet and peaceful life will entrust their entire lives to the Dao or the universe.

Although the title of tianshi was abolished during the Ming and Qing dynasties, the name Zhengyi jiaozhu was also not a gift from the emperor, but for his people it was natural to continue to have Zhang Daoling's descendant as their leader. Second, from an organizational point of view, due to the merger, many origins came from various old and new Fulu sects.

For example, the sects of Longhu, Jingming, Qingwei and others , until now the inheritance is not interrupted. Third, the book that is respected and upheld together is the book \"Zhengyi jing\" \u6b63\u4e00\u7ecf, with the main knowledge being talisman, chanting mantras, qirang zaijiao.

Medicine includes the various health care practices developed to maintain and restore health by preventing and treating disease. Contemporary medicine uses biomedical science, biomedical research, genetics, and medical technology to diagnose, treat, and prevent injuries and disease, usually through drugs or surgery, but also through a variety of therapies, including psychotherapy, external splints and traction, among others. medical devices, biopharmaceuticals, and radiotherapy. Medicine has existed for thousands of years, much of this time being practiced as an art (an area of \u200b\u200bskill and knowledge) and often linked to religious beliefs and local cultural philosophies. For example, a shaman would use medicinal plants and pray for healing or ancient philosophers and doctors would bleed according to the theory of humoralism. In recent centuries, since the emergence of modern science, most medical practices have been a combination of art and science (both basic and applied sciences, under the medical umbrella). Meanwhile, the technique of performing sutures is an art that is learned through practice and knowledge of what happens at the cellular and molecular level in the sutured tissue emerges through science. The pre-scientific forms of medicine are now known as traditional medicine and folk medicine. They remain so commonly used with or in lieu of scientific medicine that they are called alternative medicine.

Systems of medicine and health care practices have developed in various human societies since at least the beginning of human recorded history.

The most developed system of medical science apart from the Western system is the Ayurvedic tradition from India and traditional Chinese medicine.

The art of medicine is the combined application of medical science, intuition and medical judgment to determine the correct diagnosis and treatment plan for the individual patient and treat the patient according to his or her needs. Central to the practice of medicine is the relationship between the patient and the doctor that is built when a person seeks a doctor to treat their health problems. In practice, a doctor must build relationships with patients, collect data (medical history and physical examination with laboratory results or medical imaging), analyze data, make treatment plans (next tests to be undertaken, therapy, referrals), treat patients, monitor, and assess the course of treatment, and can change treatment if necessary. Everything a doctor does is recorded in a medical record, which is a legal document. The relationship between patient and doctor is the main process of medical practice. There are many views on this relationship. The ideal view, as taught in medical school, takes the side of a physician's process of studying the signs, problems, and values \u200b\u200bof patients; therefore the doctor examines the patient, interprets clinical signs, and makes a diagnosis which is then used as an explanation to the patient, and plans treatment or treatment. Basically, a doctor's job is to act as a human biologist. Therefore, a doctor must really understand how the normal state of humans is so that he can determine the extent of the patient's health condition. This process is known as diagnosis.

When meeting with a doctor, the patient will present his complaints to the doctor, who will provide various information about these clinical signs and symptoms. Then the doctor will examine, record everything he finds in the patient, and estimate various possible diagnoses. Together with the patient, the doctor will arrange the next treatment or the next laboratory test if the diagnosis cannot be confirmed. When the diagnosis has been made, the doctor will provide (\"teach\") medical advice. This teaching relationship places the doctor as a teacher (physician in English; comes from Latin which means teacher). The relationship between doctor and patient can be analyzed from an ethical perspective. Many values \u200b\u200band ethical issues can be added to this relationship. Ethical issues are strongly influenced by the level of society, age, culture, and understanding of moral values. For example, in the last 30 years, assertion and demand for the right to patient autonomy has increased in the world of Western medicine. Relationships and practice processes can also be seen from the side of social power relations (as stated by Michel Foucault or economic transactions. The medical profession had a higher status in the last century, and they were trusted to take action in public health.

Relationships are increasingly complex outside the doctor's private practice, such as in hospital wards. In hospitals, relationships are not only between doctors and patients, but also with other patients, nurses, workers from social institutions, and others. A complete medical evaluation consists of a medical history, physical examination, laboratory or imaging results, analysis of data, and determination of the diagnosis, and planning of treatment or treatment. Matters included in the medical history: In the physical examination, the doctor tries to look for signs that can support the process of making the diagnosis. The doctor uses the senses of sight, hearing, touch, and sometimes smell. Four main methods for physical examination: looking (inspection), feeling/touching (palpation), tapping to distinguish characteristic resonance (percussion), hearing (auscultation); kissing is sometimes necessary as for smelling urea in uremia. Physical examination includes: This examination can take only a few minutes if the problem is simple or up to weeks if the patient has problems with several body systems so that referrals to several specialist doctors are needed.

Animist people believe that even inanimate objects have spirits or have a relationship with ancestral spirits. Medical science gradually developed in various separate places, namely Ancient Egypt, Ancient China, Ancient India, Ancient Greece, Persia, and others. Around the 1400s there was a major change, namely the approach of medicine to science. This began to emerge with the rejection\u2014because it was not in accordance with the facts\u2014of various things put forward by figures in the past (compare with Copernicus' rejection of Ptolemaeus's astronomical theory). Some new figures such as Vesalius (an anatomist) paved the way for rejection of the great ancient medical theories such as those of Galenus, Hippocrates, and Avicenna. It is estimated that this happened due to the weakening of the power of the church in society at that time.

Calculation of dates and months in the Julian calendar was refined in 1582 to become the Gregorian calendar. This calendar is then widely used in the world to facilitate communication.

In the early Middle Ages, the most important calculation, and thus one of the main motivations for the study of European mathematics, was the problem of when to celebrate Easter. The First Council of Nicaea, in AD 325, had decided that Easter would fall on the Sunday after the full moon following the spring equinox.

Dionysius never said how he determined the date of Jesus' birth, but he may have used the surviving writings of early Christians such as Clement of Alexandria or Eusebius of Caesarea to help estimate the date, according to Alden Mosshammer, a professor emeritus of history at University of California at San Diego in his book \"The Easter Computus and the Origins of the Christian Era\". Dionysius attempted to establish AD 1 as the year of birth of Jesus Christ, but his estimates are off by several years with modern estimates placing Christ's birth around 4 BC. Dionysius devised his system to replace Diocletian's system, named after Diocletian who was Roman Emperor from AD 284 to AD 305. This system uses the number of years since Diocletian became emperor of Rome. The first year on Dionysius' Easter table, \"Anno Domini 532,\" follows the year \"Anno Diocletiani 247,\" according to Johns Hopkins University's Muse Project. Dionysius made special changes to erase the memory of Diocletian, who had cruelly persecuted Christians. Diocletian published edicts that resulted in the killing or imprisonment of many Christians and the burning of churches and Bibles. The addition of the \"BC\" component occurred two centuries after Dionysius, when the Venerable Bede of Northumbria published \"Ecclesiastical History of the English\" in 731. The work brought the AD system to the attention of more people and expanded it to include years before AD 1.

The application of the Christian system was further strengthened by the emergence of the Gregorian calendar created by Pope Gregory XIII to improve the Julian calendar created by the dictator of the Roman Republic, Julius Caesar with the help of a Greek mathematician and astronomer named Sosigenes in 46 BC. The Julian calendar has month names based on ancient Roman gods and numbers, namely Ianuarius (January), Februarius (February), Martius (March), Aprilis (April), Maius (May), Iunius (June), Quintilis, Sextilis, ( Septem) September, (Octo) October, (Novem) November, and (Decem) December, but the names of the two months were changed when Emperor Augustus ascended the throne and changed the Roman Republic to the Roman Empire in 27 BC. Emperor Augustus changed the month of Quintilis to Julius (July) in honor of his uncle, Julius Caesar who was killed by the Roman senate, and the month of Sextilis became Augustus (August) in honor of himself. After 1500 years of long use, there was a miscalculation in the Julian calendar. In the 1570s, the Julian calendar deviated from the solar date by 10 days. Therefore this calendar system is out of sync with the seasons of the year. It is feared that this calendar will keep Easter far from its proper date.

Saudi Arabia, which originally used the Hijri calendar, in 2016 began using the Gregorian calendar with the Gregorian calendar. Although the year 1 is considered to be the year of Jesus' birth, the historical evidence is too scant to support this. Dionysius Exiguus does not take into account the year 0 as well as the year that the emperor Augustus ruled the Roman Empire. Scholars date the birth of Jesus variously, from 18 BC to 7 BC. Historians don't know the year 0, the year 1 AD is the first year of the Christian system and exactly the year before it is the year 1 BC.

His teachings questioned existing Indo-Iranian religious traditions and formalized a movement that eventually became the dominant religion in Ancient Persia. He spoke Old Avesta as his mother tongue, and lived in the eastern part of the Iranian Plateau, but his exact birthplace is not known. There is no scientific consensus about when he lived. A number of researchers, using linguistic and socio-cultural evidence, date his life to around the 2nd millennium BC. Other researchers place him in the 7th and 6th centuries BC as a nearly contemporary of Cyrus the Great and Darius I. Zoroastrianism later became the official religion of Ancient Persia and its scattered branches from the 6th century BC to the the 7th M. Zoroaster is credited as the author of the Gathas as well as the Yasna Haptanghaiti, namely hymns composed in the dialect of his mother, the Old Avesta, which contain the core of Zoroastrian thought. Most of his life is known from these texts. By modern historiographical standards, there is no definitive proof of when he lived, and the historicization of him was probably part of a fairly widespread trend before the 10th century AD, where many myths and legends were turned into real history.

In a society with an advanced civilization, the belief system in God tends to be monotheism. This type of monotheism is divided into practical monotheism, speculative monotheism, theoretical monotheism, and pure monotheism. Monotheism is practically the belief in one worshiped God, but does not deny the existence of other gods. Speculative monotheism is a belief that believes in the existence of one god which originally consisted of other gods which then merged until there was only one left. Theoretical monotheism is an understanding that believes that God is one in theory, but in practice believes in more than one God. Meanwhile, pure monotheism is an understanding which states that God is one in terms of number and nature in theory, practice, thought and appreciation. There are various forms of monotheistic belief, including: For comparison, see Polytheism, which holds that there are many gods. Dualism teaches that there are two independent divine powers or eternal principles, one is Good, and the other is evil, as ancient Zoroastrianism taught (modern Zoroastrianism is completely monotheistic). This view was more fully taught in the later schools of the Gonistic system, such as Manichaeism. Most monotheists would say that by definition monotheism must be the opposite of polytheism. However, devotees within polytheistic traditions often behave like monotheists. This is because a belief in multiple gods does not imply the worship of multiple gods. Historically, many polytheists believed in the existence of many gods, but they worshiped only one, considered by the believer to be the Supreme God.",

Some people claim that Hinduism never taught polytheism Archived 2009-01-08 on the Wayback Machine.,and such claims could be considered true as one of the views of Hinduism, i.e. the Smarta view which is a monotheistic view which is inclusive of monotheism, as will be discussed later. This Smarta view dominates the view of Hinduism in the West and has confused all Hindus to be seemingly polytheistic. The Smarta division is the only branch of Hinduism that strictly follows this view. Swami Vivekananda, a follower of Ramakrishna, as well as many other figures who introduced Hinduism to the West, were all Smarta followers. Only a Smarta has no problem worshiping Shiva or Vishnu together because he understands them as different aspects of God all leading to the same God. Thus, according to Smarta theology, God can have many aspects and thus, according to this belief, they hold that Vishnu and Shiva are in fact one and the same God. The Smarta theologians, have cited many references to support this view. For example, they interpret verses in Sri Rudram, the most sacred mantra in Shivaism, and Vishnu sahasranama, one of the most sacred prayers in Vaishnavites, to prove this belief. By contrast, a Vaishnavite considers Vishnu as the only one true God, worthy of worship and the worship of other forms as subordinate or simply wrong.",

This belief dominates the view of Hinduism in the west. In contrast, exclusive monotheism claims that all of these gods are false and distinct from a monotheistic God. They are simply the creations of evil forces, or simply a mistake, as Vaishnaism, a school of Hinduism, understands any worship other than Vishnu. Exclusive monotheism is a well-known teaching in the teachings of the Abrahamic religions. Monotheism is thought to have originated from the worship of a single god within a pantheon and the elimination of other gods, as in the case of the worship of Aten during the reign of the Egyptian pharaoh Akhenaten, under the influence of his Eastern wife, Nefertiti. Iconoclasm during the reign of this pharaoh is considered to be the main origin of the destruction of idols in the Abrahamic tradition, which was based on the belief that there is no other God apart from the god they profess. Thus, it really depends here on the dualistic and tacit acknowledgment of the existence of other gods, but only as opponents who must be destroyed because they distract from their main god. Monotheism as inherited by the Israelites in the Exodus experience under Moses is considered, by those who argue that these Israelites were Hyksos, as inheritors of Akhenaten's religious policies, for previously these Jews were polytheists like the -Egyptian.

There is a theory that Judaism was influenced by Zoroastrianism, especially during the Babylonian exile, and after that much of the Old Testament was written and edited. It is assumed that earlier Judaism simply recognized that YHVH was a tribal god (possibly related to Yaw) who was the patron god of Abraham's descendants, or that there were many gods but that their god alone was the most powerful.

Silberman and colleagues, Simon and Schuster, New York (2001). The world classifies Christianity as a monotheistic religion. Christians believe in one God. They acknowledge that this God is one, even though in human understanding God is manifested in three persons: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit (together called the Trinity). In Christian theology, these three persons are not independent but are compatible, meaning that together they have the same character and essence/divine substance and are not in conflict with one another. Nevertheless, there are some minority sects of Christianity, such as the Jehovah's Witnesses, deny the idea of \u200b\u200bTrinity, while others, such as some sects of Mormonism, worship only one god, but are open to the existence of others. Rastafarians, like many other Christians, believe that God is one and also a Trinity, in their case Allah is Haile Selassie. Rastas see themselves, and possibly all individuals, as the Holy Spirit element of the Trinity, with Haile Selassie as an incarnation of both God the Father and God the Son. Haile Selassie is also seen as the head, and the Rastafarians as the body, of God. From the above statements, we can see that like Judaism and Christianity\u2014the Qur'anic interpretation of Allah is a God whose spiritual presence is experienced throughout the entire universe. Islam explains monotheism in a simple way. The Arabic translation of monotheism is (Tawhid). Tauhid means one (derived from the word wahid/ahad). This word implies union, unity or keeping something in order to remain one. The truth of a person in Islam is measured by \"submitting himself totally to the teachings of Allah\".",

During the Vedic era, the gods were considered to be 33 in number and Indra was their chief (brihadaranyaka Upanishad briefly describes the gods as consisting of eight Wasu, eleven Rudra, twelve Adityas, Indra, and Prajapati). As the leader of the Wasu, Indra was also nicknamed Wasawa. In the Vedanta era, Indra became the benchmark for all things that were ruler so that a king could be called \"Manaw\u00e8ndra\" (Manawa Indra, leader of humans) and Rama, the main character of the epic Ramayana, was called \"Raghaw\u00e8ndra\" (Raghawa Indra, Indra from the Raghu clan). Thus the real Indra was also called D\u00e9w\u00e8ndra (Lord Indra, chief of the gods). In the Puranas, Indra is the leader of the gods, the son of Aditi and Kasyapa. His power was overthrown by Bali, the grandson of Hiranyakasipu, the giant who was killed by Lord Vishnu. At Aditi's request, Vishnu incarnated as Aditi's son called Vamana, who was also called Upendra (literally means Indra's younger brother). Upendra punished Bali to restore Indra's power. Due to the generosity of Lord Vishnu, Bali was given a boon that he was entitled to serve as Indra in the next Manvantara. In the Bhagavata Purana (and other Puranas), Indra and the sons of Aditi (gods) clash with the sons of Diti (detya or demons). Sukra, the teacher of the giants, has the knowledge that can revive the dead so that every fallen giant warrior can be revived, while the warriors of the gods cannot live again. The gods were disappointed with this situation, so they asked Lord Vishnu for guidance. On his instructions, the gods negotiated with the giants to find the drink of immortality called amerta in the ocean of milk.",

In the Markandeya Purana it is stated that each manvantara (unit of time) will be led by an Indra. So Indra's position changed as the manvantara changed. The current manvantara is the seventh manvantara, consisting of 71 mahayuga. Indra who is currently in office is called Purandara, and in the next manvantara will be replaced by Bali alias Mahabali. In the book Brahmawaiwarta Purana, after defeating Wretra, Indra became arrogant and asked Wiswakarma, the architect of the gods to build a magnificent residence for him. Indra was dissatisfied with Wiswakarma's work so Indra did not allow him to leave before he was able to complete his work. Wiswakarma asked Lord Brahma for help so that he would be free from Indra's snares. Brahma also asked Vishnu for help, so Vishnu met Indra in the form of a small Brahmin. Indra greeted him without knowing that the brahmana was an incarnation of Vishnu. Vishnu praised the splendor of Indra's palace built by Wiswakarma, and said that Indra had never had such a grand residence before. Not understanding what he meant, Indra also asked about Indra before. Vishnu explains that in every universe, there is one Indra who reigns for 70 yugas so that the number of Indras is innumerable, like particles in dust. Then a group of ants was seen passing by and Vishnu said that they were the reincarnations of Indra in the past. Even now, Indra is aware that the luxury he has is meaningless, so he lets Wiswakarma go. According to Hinduism, there is an era called manvantara. The Manvantara consists of 71 mahayuga, and each mahayuga lasts 4,320,000 years. In every kalpa there are 14 manvantaras so there are 14 Indras.",

It is the successor to the Khmer Empire that once ruled the entire Indochina Peninsula between the 11th and 14th centuries. Cambodia is bordered by Thailand to the west, Laos to the north, Vietnam to the east, and the Gulf of Thailand to the south. The Mekong River and Tonle Sap Lake run through the country. Prior to its independence, the Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia helped Cambodia a lot. War tactics books written by Indonesian military officers are widely used by the Cambodian military. Therefore, prospective officers in the Cambodian military are required to study and be able to speak Indonesian. The development of Cambodian civilization occurred in the 1st century AD. During the 3rd, 4th and 5th centuries AD, the Funan and Chenla states united to establish the Cambodian region. These countries have close ties with China and India. The power of these two countries collapsed when the Khmer Empire was built and ruled in the 9th to 13th centuries. The Khmer Empire survived into the 15th century. The capital of the Khmer Empire was located at Angkor, an area built during the heyday of the Khmer. Angkor Wat, which was also built around this time, became a symbol of Khmer rule. In 1432, the Khmer were overrun by the Thai Kingdom. The Khmer Royal Council moved the capital from Angkor to Lovek, where the Empire gained great advantage because Lovek was a port city. The Khmer defense of Lovek was eventually overrun by the Thais and Vietnamese, and also resulted in the loss of most of the Khmer territory. This incident occurred in 1594.",

In 1867, King Norodom signed an agreement with the French which gave him control over the provinces of Battambang and Siem Reap which became part of Thailand. Eventually, these two areas were granted to Cambodia in 1906 in a border treaty by France and Thailand. Cambodia was made a Protectorate by the French from 1863 to 1953, as part of the Indochina Colony. After the Japanese occupation in the 1940s, Cambodia finally won its independence from France on November 9, 1953. Cambodia became a constitutional kingdom under the leadership of King Norodom Sihanouk. During the Vietnam War in the 1960s, the Kingdom of Cambodia chose to be neutral. This was not allowed by military officials, namely General Lon Nol and Prince Sirik Matak who formed a pro-US alliance to remove Norodom Sihanouk from power. From Beijing, Norodom Sihanouk decided to ally with the Khmer Rouge hordes, aiming to reclaim his throne which had been usurped by Lon Nol. This is what sparked a civil war in Cambodia.

Gods took various forms, usually in the form of humans or animals. They are immortal and have their own personality. They have emotions and intelligence just like humans. Some natural phenomena such as lightning, rain, floods, storms, and so on, including miracles are associated with them as natural regulators. They can also give punishment to creatures that are lower than them. Some gods do not have complete omnipotence so they are worshiped simply. The word \"god\" in Indonesian comes from the word dewa or daiwa (Sanskrit), which comes from the word diw (Indian-Iranian), which comes from the word deiwos or deywos (Proto-Indian-European), which is a derivative of the word diw or dyew which means \"sky, heaven, light, or shine\". The English word god (deity) comes from deit\u00e9 (Middle French), which comes from deus (Latin), which comes from devos or deiuos (Old Latin), which comes from deiwos (Proto-Italian), which ultimately has a similar root to the word \"god\" in Indonesian, namely the word diw or dyew in the Proto-Indian-European language.

The gods are life regulators and intermediaries for God in dealing with his people. These gods are: Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva, Agni, Baruna, Aswin, Kubera, Indra, Ganesha, Yama, Saraswati, Laksmi, Surya, and others. Because the concept of the one and only God is found, the gods in Hinduism are not separate gods. Gods in Hinduism live eternally, have supernatural powers and act as intermediaries for God when giving blessings to their followers. The enemies of the gods are the asuras. According to Hinduism, the gods live in a place called Swargaloka or Swarga, a place in a very beautiful universe, often equated with heaven. The ruler there was Indra, who had the title of king of heaven, or chief of the gods. In Buddhism, gods are beings who are not equal to humans, have supernatural powers, live long lives, but are not immortal.",

They emphasize that true happiness is independence from randomness or flux. So the Cynics rejected the happiness of wealth, strength, health, and prestige. As a school of philosophy, Cynicism is primarily how its adherents live and behave (even Diogenes of Sinope, who presents Cynicism as a philosophy, shows the debate whether Cynicism is a philosophy or a way of life). This school was never a formal school of philosophy; also, has never owned, and can never own, a physical school of philosophy; nor can it ever have a philosophical doctrine. But philosophers at that time believed that Cynicism contained a kind of philosophical project, Plato called this school \"crazy Socrates\". Words such as cynicism, cynicism, have a negative connotation (peioratif) for moodiness, pessimism, doubt, belittlement; contempt for the opinions of others; unsure of ideals and humanity. Cynicism is also considered as a belief that humans are self-centered, hypocritical, insincere, and only good to themselves. The Cynic school of philosophy was first founded by Antisthenes who lived in 445-365 BC, who was a loyal follower of Socrates.

His father, called Herecias, was in charge of the money making shop; he is exiled; and he spent the rest of his life in Athens and Corinth. The relationship between Antithesnes and Diogenes is not very clear, based on reconstructions that many historians believe, Diogenes and his father were accused of tampering with the currency which led to Diogenes' exile, and this event occurred after the death of Antisthesnes. The exile was the catalyst for the most dramatic change in his life. This assumption confirms that there is no relationship between the two. The history that seems most believable is his meeting with Alexander the Great. One day Diogenes was sunbathing when Alexander the Great, eager to see this great philosopher, approached him and asked if there was anything he could do for him, Diogenes replied, \"Get away from my light!\", for Alexander was blocking the sunlight. Diogenes' life is indeed very surprising, he lives in a wine pot which is often called a bath, eats and drinks very simply, drinks from cold mountain water, does not drink wine, does not eat legumes, does not wear shoes, wears only two layers of clothes. in winter without robes.

He exhibited all activities in public: eating, drinking, urinating, defecating, masturbating, and sexual intercourse, especially in the agora, a sacred place outside the confines of worldly activity. In essence, he was nicknamed doggish because of his shameless behavior. Diogenesis had a successor named Crates.

He argued that no one could be happy if happiness was measured by the balance between pleasure and pain, if we started the stages of our life from there, we would only feel miserable instead of happy. According to John Moles, no evidence of Cynic texts has survived, except for the writings of other philosophers, most notably the Stoics, Epicurus, and from the speeches of the Roman Emperor Julian (AD 4), and a number of Christian allegories about Cynicism, as well as the satirical tradition.

The subject matter includes the goals of philosophy, the limits of philosophy, and the methods. Thus, while philosophy typically investigates the nature of existence, the reality of objects, the possibility of knowledge, the nature of truth, and so on. Metaphilosophy is a self-reflective study into the nature, purpose, and method of activity that makes questions of this kind, asking what philosophy is, what kind of questions to ask, how it can pose and answer them, and what can be achieved by doing so. It is considered by some to be a subject prior to and preparation for philosophy, while others see it as inherently part of philosophy, or automatically a part of philosophy while others adopt some combination of these views. Interest in metaphilosophy led to the publication of the journal Metaphilosophy in January 1970. Many sub-disciplines of philosophy have their own 'metaphilosophical' branch, examples of which are meta-aesthetics, meta-epistemology, meta-ethics, and meta-metaphysics (meta-ontology). Although the term metaphilosophy and the explicit attention to metaphilosophy as a distinct domain within philosophy emerged in the 20th century, the topic is perhaps as old as philosophy itself, and can be traced back at least as far as the works of Ancient Greece and the Ancient Indian Nyaya. Some philosophers regard metaphilosophy as a separate subject from philosophy, above or beyond it, while others object to the idea. Timothy Williamson argues that philosophy is \"as automatically a part of philosophy\" as philosophy is of anything else. Nicholas Bunnin and Jiyuan Yu wrote that the separation of first-order studies from second-order studies had lost popularity because philosophers found it difficult to observe the difference.

We run as a rule, worse, not better, if we think a lot about our feet. So let's not talk about that's all but just do it.\" The terms metaphilosophy and philosophy of philosophy have various meanings, sometimes they are considered synonymous, and sometimes they look different. Morris Lazerowitz claims to have coined the term 'metaphilosophy' around 1940 and used it in print in 1942. Lazerowitz proposes that metaphilosophy is 'an inquiry into the nature of philosophy'. Previous usage has been found in translations from French. The term comes from the Greek words meta (\"after\", \"beyond\", \"with\") and philosoph\u00eda (\"love of wisdom\"). The term 'metaphilosophy' was used by Paul Moser in the sense of a 'second level' or more fundamental endeavor than philosophy itself, as suggested by Charles Griswold. \"The distinction between philosophy and metaphilosophy has an analogy in the familiar distinction between mathematics and metamathematics.\" This usage was deemed implausible by Ludwig Wittgenstein, who rejected the analogy between metalanguage and metaphilosophy. As Martin Heidegger put it: \"When we ask, 'What is philosophy?' we are talking about philosophy. By asking this way, we are clearly taking a position above and, therefore, outside of philosophy. But the aim of our question is to enter into philosophy, to live in it, to conduct ourselves in its way, that is, to \"philosophize\".

Others, such as Williamson, prefer the term philosophy to philosophy over metaphilosophy because it avoids the connotations of a second-order discipline that despise philosophy, and instead denotes something that is part of it. Joll suggests that to take metaphilosophy as 'the application of philosophical methods to philosophy itself' is too vague, whereas views that see metaphilosophy as a 'second order' or more abstract discipline, outside of philosophy, are \"narrow and tendentious\". Within the analytical tradition, the term \"metaphilosophy\" is mostly used to denote comments and research on earlier works that contradict original contributions to solving philosophical problems. Ludwig Wittgenstein writes about the nature of philosophical riddles and philosophical understanding. He suggested that philosophical fallacies arise from confusion about the nature of philosophical inquiry. In Philosophical Investigations, Wittgenstein writes that there is no metaphilosophy in the meta-theory of philosophy. CD Broad distinguishes Critical from Speculative philosophy in \"The Subject matter of Philosophy, and its Relation to the Special Sciences,\" in Introduction to Scientific Thought, 1923. Curt Ducasse, in Philosophy as a Science, examines several views of the nature of philosophy, and concludes that philosophy has material different lessons: assessment . Ducasse's views were among the first to be described as 'metaphilosophical'.

Many sub-disciplines of philosophy have their own branches of 'metaphilosophy'. However, some topics in 'metaphilosophy' cut across various subdivisions of philosophy to consider the foundations that are essential to all of its sub-disciplines. Some of them are as follows: Some philosophers (eg existentialists, pragmatists ) think philosophy is ultimately a practical discipline that will help us live meaningful lives by showing who we are, how we relate to the world around us and what we should do. Others (e.g. analytic philosophers) see philosophy as a technical, formal, and wholly theoretical discipline, with goals such as \"the selfless pursuit of knowledge for its own sake\". Other proposed goals of philosophy include discovering the truly fundamental reasons for everything it investigates, making explicit the nature and significance of ordinary and scientific beliefs, and unifying and transcending the insights provided by science and religion. Others suggest that philosophy is a complex discipline because it has 4 or 6 distinct dimensions. Defining philosophy and its own limits is problematic; Nigel Warburton called it \"incredibly difficult\". There is no direct definition, and the most interesting definitions are controversial. As Bertrand Russell wrote: \"We can note one characteristic feature of philosophy. If someone asks what mathematics is, we can give it a dictionary definition, say number science, for the sake of argument. So far, this is an uncontroversial statement... Definitions can be given in this way in any field where a body of knowledge must exist. But philosophy cannot be so defined.

There is not just one method that philosophers use to answer philosophical questions. More recently, some philosophers have questioned intuition as a basic tool in philosophical inquiry, from Socrates to contemporary philosophy of language. In Rethinking Intuition various thinkers discard intuition as a valid source of knowledge and thus question 'a priori' philosophy. Experimental philosophy is a form of philosophical inquiry that uses at least part of empirical research\u2014especially opinion polls\u2014to answer persistent philosophical questions. This is in contrast to the methods found in analytic philosophy, in which some say a philosopher will sometimes begin by appealing to his or her intuition about a problem and then form an argument with that intuition as a premise. However, disagreement about what experimental philosophy can achieve is widespread and several philosophers have offered criticism. One claim is that the empirical data collected by experimental philosophers can have an indirect effect on philosophical questions by enabling a better understanding of the underlying psychological processes that lead to philosophical intuition. Some analytic philosophers such as Timothy Williamson have resisted the movement against 'armchair' philosophy\u2014that is, philosophical inquiry sustained by intuition\u2014by interpreting \"intuition\" (which they believe to be fallacious) as simply referring to general cognition. faculty: If one were to question 'intuition', they would say, harboring a skeptical attitude toward general cognitive faculties\u2014the consequences of which seem philosophically unappealing.",

This city appears in the epic story of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata and was ruled by the Panca Pandavas. The city/kingdom is located on the banks of the Yamuna river, close to the present-day capital of India, Delhi. Before being known as Indraprastha, this city/kingdom was known as Kandawaprastha. According to the Mahabharata book, it is said that Kandawaprastha was the capital of a large kingdom in India in ancient times, and was ruled by the ancestors of the Pandavas and Kauravas, such as Emperor Pururawa, Nahusa, and Yayati. But the city became barren due to the curse of the sages, to punish the Buddha's son. When it was given to the Pandavas, Kandawaprastha was a barren city. Seeing the situation, Sri Krishna called Indra, the leader of the Gods, to help Yudhishthira improve the state of the country. Lord Indra brought forth Wiswakarman, the architect of the Gods who designed the magnificent city. With a ceremony, Wiswakarman succeeded in expelling all the diseases in the country and re-fertilizing the arid region. According to Krishna's promise, Kandawaprastha will be named Indraprastha if Indra is able to change the state of Kandawaprastha. Slowly the city became a prosperous city and crowds of people from neighboring countries migrated to the new country. The city of Indraprastha became a big city. After Yudistira ascended the throne, the city/kingdom of Indraprastha still received supervision from Hastinapura. Indraprastha is said to be 50,000 years old. Legend has it that Indraprastha is located in the region of Purani Choot today. A village called Indraprat existed in Delhi until the beginning of the 20th century, then it was evicted and the city of New Delhi was built on it. Excavations in the hilly region of Indraprastha, the capital of the Pandavas, as shown in Purana Qila found evidence that the area had been inhabited for almost 2,500 years.",

Indraprastha was a major city for centuries, from the time of the Mauryan Empire to the Gupta Kingdom in India, but was less well known for the founding of cities like Pataliputra, in the southeastern watershed, which became the source of two of India's most powerful kingdoms. Indraprastha was invaded by the Huns after the fall of the Gupta Kingdom. A Hindu king named Dhilon is said to have built the city of Ancient Delhi, close to Indraprastha. This history is known as the story or play Babad Alas Wanamarta. Korawa, who felt that he had succeeded in killing the Pandavas in the Bale Sigalagala story, was shocked when he found out that the Pandavas were still alive. Prabu Duryudana, who did not want the kingdom of Astina or Hastina, was asked by the Pandavas as the legitimate rulers to find various ways to kill the Pandavas again. To soften this intention, the Pandavas were given an area that was still a forest called the Wanamarta forest (Wana means forest). The forest is known for its awe, so haunted that the terms \"People Come, People Die, Animals Come, Animals Die\" (Jalma Mara, Jalma Mati, Sato Mara, Sato Mati) are used to describe its awe. The Pandavas had difficulty clearing the Wanamarta forest because they were controlled by five spirits whose faces were similar to the Pandavas. The five spirits are Yudistira who is similar to King Puntadewa, Dandungwacana who is similar to Bima, Dananjaya who is similar to Arjuna, Nakula and Sadewa who are similar to the twins Pinten and Tansen. The five rulers of Wanamarta do not want their peace to be disturbed. Arjuna, who had Jayengkaton oil, applied it to each Pandawa's eye so that he could see the five spirits of the ruler of Wanamarta. Finally the Pandavas were able to defeat the five rulers of the Wanamarta forest and all five of them incarnated into the bodies of the Pandavas so that the Pandavas had the same name as the rulers of the Wanamarta forest and immediately the Wanamarta forest turned into an extraordinary magnificent kingdom named Indraprastha or Amarta.",

He is widely regarded as the chief contributor of Ashkenazi Jews to Torah studies. Famous as the author of a comprehensive commentary or commentary on the Talmud, as well as a comprehensive commentary on the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible) He is considered the \"father\" of all subsequent Talmudic exegesis (i.e., Baalei Tosafot) and \"Tanach\" (i.e., Ramban, Ibn Ezra, Ohr HaChaim, etc.) Noted for his ability to convey the basic meaning of a text in a succinct fashion and fluent. Hence Rashi's writings appeal to learned scholars as well as beginning students. His work continues to be central to contemporary Jewish studies. Comments dances or commentaries on the Talmud, which comprise almost the entire Babylonian Talmud (30 tracts in total), have been included in every edition of the Talmud since it was first printed by Daniel Bomberg in the 1520s. His commentary on the Tanakh \u2014 especially on the Chumash (\"Five Books of Moses\") \u2014 is an important tool for students of all levels. The later commentaries also formed the basis of more than 300 \"supercommentaries\" analyzing Rashi's choice of language and quotations, written by some of the greatest names in rabbinic literature. Rashi's family name \"Yitzhaki\" is derived from her father's name, Yitzhak. His name's acronym is often fancifully developed as \"Rabban Shel YIsrael\" meaning \"Rabbi of Israel\", or as \"Rabbenu SheYichyeh\" (\"Our Rabb, let him live\").

From his father's side, Rashi is claimed to be the 33rd descendant of Yochanan Hasandlar, who is the 4th descendant of Gamaliel the Elder, who is said to be a descendant of King David. In his numerous works, Rashi himself never claims this. The main early rabbinic source on his genealogy, Response No. 29 by Solomon Luria, also makes no such claim. Rashi died on 13 July 1105 (29 Tammuz 4865) at the age of 65. He is buried in Troyes, France. The location of his burial is recorded in the Seder ha-Dorot (Seder Hadoros), but gradually the exact location was forgotten. Several years ago, a University of Paris (Sorbonne) professor discovered an ancient map showing the location of a tomb, now an open-air park in the city of Troyes. Following this discovery, French Jews erected a large monument in the center of the garden, a large black and white globe with prominent Hebrew letters, Shin (\u05e9) (i.e. for \"Shlomo\", Rashi's given name). On the monument's granite base is carved Rabbi Shlomo Yitzchaki \u2014 Commentator and Guide. Rashi had no sons, but had three daughters, Miriam, Yocheved, and Rachel, all married to Talmudic scholars. There is a legend that Rashi's daughters wore tefillin. Although some Ashkenazi Jewish women in medieval times wore tefillin, there is no evidence that Rashi's daughters did. Rashi's commentary on the Tanakh \u2014 and especially his commentary on the Chumash \u2014 is an important complement to any Talmudic study at any level. Drawing from it Midrashik, Talmudic and Aggadic literature (including literature that is now no longer found), as well as his knowledge of grammar, halakhah, and how things happened, Rashi explained the \"simple\" meaning of a text so that an intelligent five-year-old could understand it.",

Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi writes that \"Rashi's commentary on Torah is the 'wine of the Torah', which opens the heart and reveals one's essential love and fear of God.\" Rashi wrote the first comprehensive commentary or commentary on the Talmud. Rashi's interpretations, drawn from his knowledge of the entire contents of the Talmud, attempt to provide a complete explanation of the words or the logical structure of each Talmudic passage. Unlike other commentators, Rashi does not paraphrase or skip certain parts of a text, but instead elaborates phrase by phrase. Often he would provide punctuation for unpunctuated texts, for example explaining \"Is this a question\"; \"He said this while being surprised\", \"He repeated this to give approval\", and so on. Rashi's commentary on the Talmud continues to form a key basis of contemporary rabbinical research and interpretation. Without Rashi's commentary, the Talmud is considered a \"closed book\". With his commentary, any learner who has been introduced by his teacher to study, will be able to continue learning on his own, deciphering the language and its meaning with the help of Rashi. The semi-cursive typeface used to print Rashi's commentaries in both the Talmud and the Tanakh is often called \"Hebrew Rashi\" or \"Rashi script.\" This is not to say that Rashi himself used the script in his script: the typeface is based on Sephardic Jewish handwriting from the 15th century. What came to be called the \"Rashi script\" was used by early Hebrew typographers such as the Soncino family and Daniel Bomberg, a Christian printing house in Venice, in their commentary editions (such as Mikraot Gedolot and the Talmud, where Rashi's commentary is predominant) to differentiate between rabbinical interpretations of the main text, which is printed with a square typeface.",

The Javanese version of Salya is married to Setyawati and has five children, namely Erawati, Surtikanti, Banowati, Burisrawa, and Rukmarata. Salya's three daughters each married Baladewa, Karna and Duryudana. Among Salya's five children, only Burisrawa has an ugly face like a giant, while the others are beautiful and handsome. This is a curse because when she was young, Salya killed her own giant father-in-law out of disgust. His in-laws named Bagawan Bagaspati.

Duryudana as brother-in-law asked for Baladewa's help to marry Subhadra to Burisrawa, not Arjuna. Baladeva is affected. He also put stringent conditions on Arjuna if he wanted to marry Subhadra, his sister. It turned out that Arjuna succeeded in fulfilling all the requirements put forward by Baladewa. Krishna, who is also Subhadra's brother, asked Baladewa to be fair. Finally, Baladewa also determines the marriage between Subhadra and Arjuna. This made Burisrawa go home full of shame.

So a competition was held for anyone who wanted to marry Dewaki.

The center of the study of geography is the relationship between humans and their environment. In general, geography is divided into two branches of science, namely physical geography and human geography. After 1945, geography was more directed to social sciences and prioritized the study of human geography. Geography has important concepts that are used to understand the relationship, form, and function of natural events and social events. Erastothenes was the first to use the term geography. The word geography comes from a combination of words in Greek, namely the words geo and graphein. Geo means earth and graphein means writing or painting, so geography is defined as writing about the earth. In a broader sense, geography is defined as the study of the earth. The earth in question is not only related to its physical form, but includes all natural phenomena and processes that occur along with the symptoms and processes of life. The symptoms and processes of life also discuss the life of the inhabitants of the earth, namely plants, animals and humans. The term geography became known and spread widely among scholars in the 1st century AD. Knowledge of geography has been known since ancient Greece. At that time, mythology still had a lot of influence on knowledge about the earth. The influence of mythology diminished after natural sciences began to develop from the 6th century BC. The basis of natural sciences and exact sciences began to form knowledge about the earth. The investigation of the earth began to make use of logic. In the pre-Christian era, philosophers and historians became the shapers of views and understanding of geography. Explanations about geography are still historical, while explanations about history are geographical.",

In pre-Christian times, knowledge of geography was only given to things that could be measured using mathematics. Explanations of space on earth are mostly drawn by travelers. The concept given is based on historical events experienced directly or through direct observation. In addition, the explanation of geography also begins to discuss the symptoms and characteristics of nature and humans as natural inhabitants. The explanation given by travelers is still in character to compare their origin area and other areas which have clear differences. In the late Middle Ages, accounts of geography were still the result of travel reports. This report is divided into land travel reports and sea travel reports. Knowledge of geography is obtained from the travel records of traders who trade between countries and between continents. In addition, knowledge of geography was also obtained through war troops who expanded into other countries or kingdoms. A road record that gives quite a lot of information about geography is the travelogue of Via Appia. This record describes the overland travel route between Rome and Capua in 950 AD. Another record that also provides information about geography is the Silk Road travelogue. This note describes the overland route from China to the Middle East during the Middle Ages. These travel notes were then disseminated to various countries or kingdoms, resulting in various activities aimed at discovering new areas that were not yet known at all. During the renaissance, knowledge of geography experienced rapid development because of the renewal movement in the fields of art and philosophy.

This search for profits is done by forming colonies or trading. The travelers also have a purpose related to religion. While trading or forming colonies, they also spread the religion they believe in to new areas. This goal is considered a sacred duty in the context of developing religious teachings. In addition, knowledge about new areas can also be obtained due to war. The desire to seek economic profit and the spread of religion can lead to social conflicts in various different interests. This difference in interests then creates a conflict that triggers a war to fight for the influence of power. The nature of geography writing is still descriptive in nature even though geographical discoveries have been made with economic, religious and power goals. In addition, the explanations given have not been written by taking into account the observed symptoms. Travelers also travel to explore new areas to serve as an adventure. The results of these adventures are then used to increase knowledge about the earth. At this time there was also rapid development of the mathematical concept of geography. Scholars began to gain latitude as the influence of the church began to wane. Scholars in the natural sciences began to make discoveries that contradicted the church's interpretation of the Bible. Geographical knowledge began to be studied in depth since the discoveries by natural science scholars in the 17th century AD. Influential figures were Isaac Newton (1629-1695), Robert Boyle (1627-1691), and Christiaan Huygens (1629- 1695).

In addition, geography is also starting to be seen as knowledge that can be used practically. On the other hand, the understanding of human geography experienced a decline among scholars in the early and mid-19th century AD. The decline in knowledge occurred in Western Europe, especially in England and Berlin. In England, the science of human geography did not develop after Alexander Maconochie resigned from his job as a human geography scientist. At the University of Berlin, human geography did not progress. The cause was the absence of a successor from a geographer named Carl Ritter who died in 1859. At the end of the 19th century AD, the science of geography was more focused on geological knowledge and scientific methods related to geology. The studies carried out prioritize climate, plants and animals, as well as natural landscapes. In the United States, geography is experiencing rapid development among scientists of applied science. Landscapes and water resources began to be studied by John Wesley Powell (1834-1902). This knowledge is then used to determine the best use of land in a place. Resource conservation also began to be considered and studied by George Perkins Marsh (1801-1882). Marsh expressed his views on resource conservation in the introduction to his book Man and Nature, or Physical Geography as Modified by Human Action (1864). Marsh developed the thoughts of Alexander von Humboldt and Ritter to express his thoughts on human influence on natural destruction.

Geographers then use a mathematical understanding of spatial relationships to derive new insights about geography. in particular the geographical location of cities and their interactions. In addition, there were developments in human geography. Investigations into human geography no longer have a specific purpose but use scientific research. The approach used in research is neoclassical economic theories with the concepts of Marxism, feminism, post-colonialism and post-modernism. At this time, geography has been used to solve various problems faced by humans. Geography as a scientific field then began to be combined with various other scientific disciplines. In addition, geographic research has also used statistical methods and quantitative methods and utilized the use of computer tools to process and analyze data. Geographical data procurement has also used satellite imagery so that the information obtained is more precise and accurate. The use of satellite imagery in geographic research studies was pioneered by geographers from the United States and Sweden in 1960 by applying quantitative methods. Satellite imagery is used in physical geography and other branches of geography with the help of computer tools. The use of satellite imagery is then applied in various developed countries. Geography has two objects of discussion, namely material objects and formal objects. The material object of geography is the phenomenon of the geosphere which includes all inanimate objects and living things on the earth and its environment. Discussion of the geosphere consists of five layers, namely the atmosphere, lithosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and anthroposphere. The atmosphere, lithosphere, and hydrosphere discuss inanimate matter on earth. The atmosphere discusses the air that envelops the earth, the lithosphere discusses the earth's crust, while the hydrosphere discusses water. Biosphere and antrosphere discuss living things.",

This perspective is then accompanied by a way of thinking and analyzing the material. The approach used to create a perspective on material objects is through analysis. Analysis that can be applied in geography is spatial analysis, environmental analysis, and regional analysis. Location is the concept of the existence of an object on earth related to a place or location of an area. The concept of location is divided into absolute location and relative location. Absolute location can be known by looking at latitude and longitude, while relative location is a location that changes places. Absolute location conditions are fixed and guided by earth astronomy. Latitude is used to determine climate differences, while longitude is used to determine time differences. In geographic studies, relative location is used more than absolute location. Relative location is used to determine geographic location. The concept of distance is used in social, economic and political life. Humans use the concept of distance to obtain various advantages. In geography, the concept of distance is divided into absolute distance and relative distance. The difference between absolute distance and relative distance is in the units used. Absolute distance is expressed in meters or kilometers, while relative distance is expressed in units of time. In geography, morphology is the concept of the shape of the earth's surface. This form is obtained through natural processes. Morphology links between natural processes and their relationship with human activities.

Patterns can also be formed through interactions between the environment around humans and other environments. The discussion of patterns in geography relates to the distribution of natural phenomena on earth. Agglomeration is a concept of population grouping. The grouping is based on the activities carried out by humans in an area or area. Use value relates to the benefits provided by an area on earth to living things. This utility value is relative and varies in each region. Use value in an area is distinguished into an advantage and a disadvantage. The development of useful value is useful for increasing the welfare of a region. Interdependence is the concept of interdependence between one region and another. Each region can influence and be influenced by other regions because of interactions to meet needs. The interactions that occur later form communication, trade and migration between regions. Area differentiation is related to comparisons between regions which are known through the differences that exist. Each region has a uniqueness that distinguishes it from other regions. Room linkages provide an explanation of the level of linkages between regions due to interactions. The type of interaction that occurs is a causal relationship in each region. Spatial analysis is a unique approach in geography because it is the study of the diversity of the earth's surface by examining each of its spatial aspects. Aspects of the earth's surface include location factors, natural conditions, and socio-cultural conditions of the people. In studying these aspects, a geographer is very concerned about the factors of location, distribution (spread), interrelation and interaction. One example of this spatial approach is a piece of land that is expensive because the soil is fertile, and is located by the roadside.",

In the analysis of the geographical environment examines the symptoms of interaction, and the interrelationships between physical (natural) and non-physical (social) components. The ecological approach conducts analysis by looking at changes in biotic and abiotic components in the balance of an ecosystem in a region. For example, a pasture abandoned by a herd of grazing animals will lead to changes in land use, and competition for occupants. Regional complex analysis compares various regions on earth by taking into account the spatial and environmental aspects of each region in a comprehensive manner. For example, the polar region is certainly very different from the characteristics of the equatorial region. The principle of distribution is the earliest principle used to study geographic phenomena and facts. The use of this principle is based on the uneven distribution of various geographical phenomena on earth. The forms of phenomena that use the principle of distribution are landscapes, plants, animals and humans. A phenomenon can be explained in a directed way through the principle of distribution. In addition, the principle of distribution can also explain the relationship between phenomena. The principle of relatedness is a continuation of the principle of distribution. Phenomena whose distribution patterns and facts are known, are linked to one another. The principle of interrelatedness is based on the fact that humans and nature have an interrelated relationship. This relationship can occur between humans and humans, nature and nature, or nature and humans.

In the principle of chorology, analysis of the distribution of geographic symptoms and problems is carried out by observing aspects that influence interaction. The principles of chorology are applied to modern geography. Ptolemy's world map reconstructed from Ptolemy's Geographia (c. 150) in the 15th century, indicating \"Sinae\" (China) on the extreme right, outside the islands of \"Taprobane\" (Sri Lanka, large), and \"Aurea Chersonesus\" (Southeast Asia ). Ptolemy also designed, and provided instructions on how to make maps of the inhabited world (oikoumen\u00e8), and of the Roman provinces. In the second part of his Geographia he gives a list of the topography required, and annotations for the maps. His Oikoumen\u00e8 spans 180 degrees of longitude from the Canary Islands in the Atlantic Ocean to China, and about 80 degrees of latitude from the Arctic, east India to deep into Africa; Ptolemy realized that he knew only a quarter of the world . Spatial relations are key to this synoptic science, and it uses maps as its main tool. Classical cartography is combined with a more modern geographic analysis approach to produce a computer-based Geographic Information System (GIS). Geographers use four approaches: Geographical aspects are based on the structure of the environment. Based on the structure of the environment, geography can be divided into physical aspects and non-physical aspects. The physical aspects of geography include topological, biotic and non-biotic aspects. While the non-physical aspect prioritizes the study of human behavior. Non-physical aspects include social aspects, economic aspects, cultural aspects, and political aspects.

The branch of non-physical geography is also called anthropogeography which focuses as a social science, the non-physical aspects that cause world phenomena. Study how humans adapt to their territory, and other humans, and at the macroscopic transformation of how humans play a role in the world. Can be divided into: economic geography, political geography (including geopolitics), social geography (including urban geography), feminist geography, and military geography. Related topics: Countries of the world - countries - nations - states - associations of individuals - provinces - counties - cities - districts. During the era of environmental determinism, geography was not a science of spatial relations, but of how humans and their environment interact. Although understanding of environmental determinism has not developed, there is still a strong tradition among geographers to study the relationship between humans and nature. There are two fields in human-environmental geography: cultural ecology, and politics, and disaster-risk research. Human characteristics that must fulfill their life needs, must make use of nature or natural exploitation in order to fulfill the needs of life. This branch of geography is a relatively new one. Developed around the 1980s by European geographers, especially from the Netherlands. When the university collaboration between the two countries was carried out, a number of geographers from the Netherlands participated in the lecturer transplantation program at UGM. The result was the birth of a new study program called the Regional Development Planning Study Program, and now better known as the Regional Development Study Program.",

        "paragraph": "Before becoming a separate discipline that combined Geography and Regional Planning, this project was known as Rural and Regional Development Planning (RRDP). In addition, it can be explained that regional planning and development can be related to social sciences, especially related to social phenomena that occur in society, so that they are very in touch with existing social concepts and theories. Cultural ecology emerged as a result of Carl Sauer's work in geography, and thought in anthropology. Cultural ecology studies how humans adapt to their natural environment. The science of sustainability (sustainability) then grows out of this tradition. Political ecology arose when some geographers used aspects of critical geography to look at the relationship of natural forces, and how they affect humans. For example, the influential study by Michael Watts argued that famine in the Sahel was caused by changes in the region's political and economic system as a result of colonialism, and the spread of capitalist practices. Research on disasters was started by Gilbert F. Withe, who tried to understand why people live in floodplains that are prone to disasters. Since then, the field has developed into a multi-disciplinary field, studying natural disasters (such as earthquakes) and technological disasters (such as nuclear reactor leaks). Geographers who study disasters are interested in the dynamics of disasters, and how humans and society deal with them. This branch seeks to explain how cultures from different parts of the world developed, and became what they are today. The study of the earth's surface is one of the keys to this field - many conclusions are drawn about the influence of ancient societies on the environment, and beyond. \"Historical Geography\" is, of course, the trade-off of geography and history. But in the United States, it has a more specific meaning. This name was coined by Carl Ortwin Sauer of the University of California, Berkeley with his program of reorganizing cultural geography (some say all geography) across all regions, beginning in the early 20th century.",

        "paragraph": "For Sauer, the face of the earth and the culture on it can only be understood if all its influences (physical, cultural, economic, political, environmental) are studied according to history. Sauer emphasized area studies as the only way to get specific to a region of the earth. Sauer's philosophy was a major shaper of geographical thought in America in the mid-20th century. Until now regional studies is still part of the geography department on campuses in the US. But many geographers think this will harm the science of geography itself in the long term: the reason is that there is too much data collection, and classification, and too little analysis, and explanation. These studies became more region specific as later generations of geographers struggled to find proper names for these. Perhaps this is what caused the 1950s crisis in geography which nearly destroyed it as an academic discipline. Remote sensing is the science of obtaining information about objects or phenomena on the earth's surface without direct contact with the object or phenomenon being studied. Observation and collection of information is carried out using certain sensors. The sensors used can capture and record reflections of light or other energy sources and then convert them into data that can be explained, analyzed and applied in real terms. The concept of remote sensing is very similar to how the human eye works. The sensors used in remote sensing are mounted on platforms in the form of satellites or airplanes. Satellites are used for remote sensing from outer space, while airplanes are used for sensing inside the Earth's atmosphere. The results of remote sensing with satellites are called satellite images, while the results of sensing with aircraft are called aerial photographs. Remote sensing is obtained through recording media of objects or phenomena that utilize energy originating from electromagnetic waves, and manifests the recording results in the form of images.",

        "paragraph": "The definition of 'without direct contact' here can be interpreted narrowly, and broadly. In a narrow sense, it means that there is no contact between the object and the analyst, for example when satellite image data is processed and transformed into a surface temperature distribution map at the time of recording. Broadly speaking this means that contact is possible in the form of 'ground truth' activities, namely the collection of field samples to serve as the basis for modeling through interpolation, and extrapolation over a much wider area, and at a higher level of detail. Initially remote sensing was viewed less as part of geography than cartography. Nevertheless, gradually it is realized that remote sensing is the only major tool in geography that is able to provide a synoptic overview\u2014a brief but comprehensive view\u2014of an area as a starting point for further study. Remote sensing is also capable of producing various kinds of spatial information in an ecological and regional context which characterizes geographic studies. In addition, in terms of percentage, remote sensing education in the United States, Australia and Europe is mostly provided by geography science institutions (departments, schools or faculties). In terms of the methods used, there are manual or visual remote sensing methods and digital remote sensing methods. Manual remote sensing utilizes printed images (aerial photographs, scanned images from aircraft and satellite scanners) through manual/visual analysis and interpretation. Digital remote sensing uses images in digital format, for example digital camera shots, scanned aerial photographs that have been printed, and scanned by satellite sensors, and analyzes them with the help of a computer. Both manual and digital methods produce maps, and reports. Maps resulting from the manual method can be converted into digital thematic maps through a digitization process (often termed digitization).",

        "paragraph": "The manual method is sometimes also done with the help of a computer, namely through an interpretation process on the monitor screen (on-screen digitization), which directly generates a digital map. The digital image analysis method generates digital thematic maps directly. These digital maps can be laid out and printed to become cartographic products (called cartographic data bases), but can also be input into a geographic information system as a geographic database. These maps henceforth become the point of departure for geographers in carrying out their geographical studies. Cartography or mapping studies the representation of the earth's surface with abstract symbols. You could say, without much controversy, cartography is the cause of the widespread study of geography. Most geographers admit that their interest in geography began when they were fascinated by maps in their childhood. although other sub-disciplines of geography still rely on maps to display the results of their analysis, mapmaking itself is still too abstract to be considered as a separate science. Cartography developed from a collection of drawing techniques to become part of a science. A cartographer must understand cognitive psychology, and ergonomics to create appropriate symbols to represent information about the earth that others can understand effectively, and behavioral psychology to influence readers to understand the information they create. They also have to study geodesy, and beyond simple mathematics to understand how the shape of the earth affects the distortion or distortion of the projection onto a plane. Geographic Information System addresses the problem of storing information relating to the existence of an object or phenomenon on earth. The entire process of data management up to the results of analysis on Geographic Information Systems is done via computer. Geographic Information System consists of a collection of software, hardware, geographic data, users and applications.",

        "paragraph": "The required geographic data is in the form of spatial data and attribute data. Spatial data relates to the position or geographic location of an object on the earth's surface, while attribute data provides an explanation in the form of numerical information, photographs or narratives. Spatial data can be obtained from analog map graphics, aerial photographs, satellite imagery, field surveys, theodolite measurements, or measurements using the Global Position System. Meanwhile, attribute data can be obtained through statistics, field measurements, or censuses. Geographical quantitative methods discusses the numerical methods that are typical (or at least those that are widely found) in geography. In addition to spatial analysis, you may find cluster analysis, discriminant analysis, and non-parametric statistical tests in geographic studies. Urban and territorial planning uses geography to help learn how to develop (or not develop) land according to certain criteria, such as security, beauty, economic opportunity, protection of natural or cultural heritage, etc. Urban planning, both small towns and cities, or rural planning might be considered applied geography even though it might seem like more of an art, and history lesson. Some of the problems faced by regional planners include the exodus of rural and urban communities, and Smart Growth. In the 1950s, the regional science movement emerged, led by Walter Isard to provide a more quantitative, and analytical basis for geographic problems, in response to the qualitative approach to traditional geography courses. Regional science contains knowledge of how the spatial dimension plays an important role, such as regional economics, resource management, location theory, urban and regional planning, transportation and communication, human geography, population distribution, earth's ecology, and environmental quality. Geography can be utilized in three fields, namely subjectivism, logical objectivism and ethical and aesthetic values.",

The benefits of geography in the field of logical objectivism are seen more through empirical knowledge obtained from experimental results and direct measurements. In this case, geography is used to see the overall geographic location of a particular area. In the field of ethics and aesthetics, geography is useful for carrying out mutually beneficial and non-harmful interactions between humans and their environment. Ethics and aesthetics in geography can occur through the use of areas that do not cause natural disasters that can endanger humans as users of the area. In Indonesia, only five state universities open Geography study programs as pure sciences, namely the University of Indonesia (UI), Gadjah Mada University (UGM), Semarang State University (UNNES), Padang State University (UNP), and State University. Malang (UM), and one private tertiary institution (Muhammadiyah University of Surakarta). Meanwhile, the Geography Education study program is in 45 tertiary institutions. UGM, Geography has developed further so that it has become a separate Faculty since 1963, namely the Faculty of Geography. Currently, he has a higher education level from D3 (diploma) Remote Sensing, and GIS, S1, S2, and S3. The UGM Faculty of Geography also studies regional planning and development. At UI, Geography is a major of the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences (MIPA). Geography is studied as an applied part of the pure sciences parallel to Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Statistics and Biology. The Faculty of Geography of UMS was founded by a number of alumni and lecturers of the Faculty of Geography UGM.

The word Bh\u0101ratayuddha is a Sanskrit word meaning \"War of Bharata's lineage\". This war is the climax of the Mahabharata story, which is a famous epic from India that has been adapted in Java as a work of art in the form of kakawin and wayang. The term Bharatayuddha is taken from the title of a kakawin manuscript in Old Javanese written in 1157 by Empu Sedah on the orders of Maharaja Jayabhaya, king of the Kadiri Kingdom. In fact, the book of Bharatayuddha was written during the time of Kediri to symbolize the state of civil war between the Kingdom of Kediri and Jenggala, who are both descendants of King Erlangga. The state of the civil war was described as if it was written in Byasa's Mahabarata Book, namely the war between the Pandavas and the Kauravas who were actually descendants of Byasa the writer. The story of Kakawin Bharatayuddha was later adapted into New Javanese under the title Serat Bratayuda by the poet Yasadipura I during the Surakarta Kasunanan era. In Yogyakarta, the story of Bharatayuddha was rewritten under the title Serat Purwakandha during the reign of Sri Sultan Hamengkubuwana V. Its writing began on October 29, 1847 to July 30, 1848. Similar to the Indian version of the Mahabharata, Bharatayuddha was the peak of the dispute between the Pandawa family led by Puntadewa ( or Yudhishthira) against their cousins, namely the Kauravas led by Duryodhana. Both the Pandavas and the Kauravas are descendants of Bharata, who is described in the Mahabharata as a Cakrawartin (royal king), ruler of the South Asian land (India and its surroundings). However, the version of the Javanese puppet shows that the Bharatayuddha war is an event that has been determined by the gods, even before the Pandavas and Kauravas were born.",

In other words, according to the Javanese tradition, the Mahabharata story is considered to have taken place on the island of Java. The seeds of discord between the Pandavas and Korawas started when their parents were both young. Pandu, the father of the Pandavas, one day brought home three daughters from three countries, named Kunti, Gandari and Madri. One of them was dedicated to Dhritarashtra, his blind brother. Dhritarastra chose the three daughters by lifting them one by one. In the end, Gandari was chosen, who had the heaviest weight, because Dhritarastra thought that in the future Gandari would have many children, just like Dretarastra's dream. This made the princess from the Plasajenar Kingdom offended and hurt. Gandari felt he was nothing more than a trophy. He also vowed that his descendants would become the sworn enemy of the Pandu children. Gandari and his younger brother, named Shakuni, educate their one hundred children (Korawa) to always be hostile to Pandu's children, numbering five people (Pandawa). When Pandu died, his children suffered even more. The Kauravas are always targeting their lives. The following stories are not much different from the Mahabharata version, including the attempt to kill the Pandavas in a burning palace, to the seizure of the Amarta Kingdom\u2014the kingdom founded by Yudistira\u2014through a game of dice. As a result of the defeat in the gambling, the Pandavas had to undergo exile in the forest for 12 years, plus a year of disguised as commoners in the Kingdom of Wirata. But after the sentence ended, the Kauravas refused to restore the rights of the Pandavas.

The book is called Jitabsara or Jitapsara, which contains scenarios (Jw. : grip) of the course of the battle in Bharatayuddha, including the order of who will be the victim. This book was written by Batara Penyarikan, as a recorder of what Batara Guru (king of heaven) discussed with Batara Narada regarding this scenario. Kresna, the king of Dwarawati who became an adviser to the Pandavas, managed to overhear the discussion and writing of the book by changing his form into a white bee (Jw: Klanceng Putih). When it came to the part where King Baladewa (Krishna's older brother) was fighting with Antareja (Bima's son), the White Clanceng spilled the ink used, so that part or chapter was canceled. Klanceng Putih then transformed into a Speech Spirit, which is the subtle form (soul) of Batara Kresna. Sukma Wicara protested against the planned fight between Prabu Baladewa and Antareja, because Baladewa would definitely lose to Antareja. Apart from that, Sukma Wicara asked to be allowed to have the Jitapsara Book. Batara Guru gave up the Jitapsara book into the possession of Krishna, as long as he always kept its contents secret, and was willing to exchange it for the Wijayakusuma Flower, which is Krishna's heirloom flower which can be used to revive the dead. Apart from that, Batara Guru also asked Kresna to arrange the settlement of the Baladewa and Antareja problems. Krishna agreed.

The course of the Javanese wayang version of the Bharatayuddha war is slightly different from the Mahabharata version of the Kurukshetra war. According to the Javanese version, the battle was arranged in such a way that only certain figures who were appointed went to war, while the others waited their turn to go forward. For example, if in the Mahabharata version, Duryodhana often meets and engages in battle against Bimasena, then in the wayang they only meet once, namely in the last act when Duryodhana dies at the hands of Bima. On the Pandawa side, who was in charge of organizing the war strategy was Kresna. He has the right to decide who should go forward, and who should step back. meanwhile on the Korawa side everything was arranged by Duryodhana's advisors, namely Bisma, Drona (Drona), and Salya.

Because the story of Bharatayuddha which is spread in Indonesia is influenced by a side story that is not found in the original book (a book from India in Sanskrit), there may be many differences according to each region. Nonetheless, the gist of the story is the same. It is said, Bharatayuddha begins with the appointment of the great senapati or war leader of both sides. The Pandavas appointed Resi Seta (Sweta) as war leader with companions on the right wing of North Arya and left wing of Arya Wratsangka. The three of them are famous for their toughness and come from the Wirata Kingdom which supports the Pandavas. The Pandavas used the Brajatikswa war strategy, which means sharp weapons.

Even though he was not a member of the army and was outside the line of battle, he had violated the rules of war by intending to kill Resi Seta. Rukmarata shoots Resi Seta but the arrow does not injure the target. After seeing who shot him, Resi Seta then urged the opposing troops towards Rukmarata. After Rukmarata's chariot was in the middle of a battle, Resi Seta immediately hit Kyai Death's mace (beater), until it shattered into pieces. Rukmarata, crown prince of Mandaraka died instantly. In that battle North Arya died at the hands of Prabu Salya while Arya Wratsangka was killed by Reverend Durna. Bisma, armed with Aji Nagakruraya, Aji Dahana, the Naracabala bow, the arrows of Kyai Cundarawa, and the weapons of Kyai Salukat faced Resi Seta who was armed with the mace of Kyai Lukitapati, the messenger of death to those who approached him. The fight between the two is said to be very balanced and exciting, until finally Bisma can kill Resi Seta. The first round of Bharatayuddha ended with the joy of the Korawas because of the death of the Pandawa war leader. After Resi Seta died, the Pandavas then appointed Trustajumena (Drestadyumna) as their war leader in the Bharatayuddha war. Meanwhile, Bhishma remained the leader of the Korawa war. In this round the two sides fought with the same tactic, namely Garudanglayang (flying Garuda). In this battle two twin Korawa members, namely Wikataboma and Bomawikata, were killed after their heads were pitted against Bima.

Hephaestus made a golden throne, when Hera sat on it, the throne would not let Hera go. The other gods asked Hephaestus to return to Olympus and release Hera, but Hephaestus refused and said, \"I have no mother.\" Dionysus then went to him and gave him wine until Hephaestus became drunk. Dionysus then brought Hephaestus back to Olympus on a donkey and accompanied by revelers. This scene is found in many pottery paintings in Attica and Corinth. In the paintings, the presence of dancers and Dionysus' troupe guiding the donkey indicates that the procession was part of the dithurambos celebration which was the forerunner of the satirical drama in Athens in the fifth century.

The name Srikandi is the Indonesian version of \u015aikha\u1e47\u1e0din in Sanskrit. The feminine form is \u015aikha\u1e47\u1e0din\u012b. Literally, the word \u015aikhandin or \u015aikhandini means \"having a tassel\" or \"having a crest\". In the Mahabharata, in a previous life Srikandi was born as a woman named Amba. The story of Amba is contained in the first volume of the Mahabharata, namely Adiparwa, and in the fifth volume of the Mahabharata, Udyogaparwa. In Adiparwa it is told that Bisma\u2014a prince from Hastinapura, the capital of the Kuru Kingdom\u2014brought Amba from a competition in the Kasi Kingdom, to marry Wicitrawirya, his half sister. Arriving in Hastinapura, Amba confessed that she had already chosen Raja Salwa as her future husband. Because Bhishma did not want Amba to marry forcefully, he sent Amba back so he could marry King Salwa. However, King Salwa, who felt his pride had been stepped on by Bisma, did not want to marry Amba. Amba returns to Bisma's residence to marry her, but Bhishma refuses because she vows to remain celibate forever.",

Amba asked Parasurama, one of Bisma's teachers, for help. But Parasurama was unable to force Bisma to marry Amba, even though he resorted to violence. Finally Amba decided to pray to the gods to find a way to kill Bhishma. According to C. Rajagopalachari's rewritten Mahabharata, Lord Subramanya gave him a puspamala and said that anyone who wishes to use it will become the killer of Bhishma. Amba is also looking for people who are willing to use it, but no one dares even though there is a guarantee of success from the god. After being rejected by various knights, finally Amba arrived at King Drupada's palace, and got the same result. Desperately, Amba threw the puspamala over the palace gates and no one dared to touch it. From Drupada's palace, Amba went and prayed to Lord Shiva with the wish to be the cause of Bhishma's death. Amba's request was granted by the god. However, as a woman who had never received military training, Amba asked Shiva about a way to kill Bisma. Lord Shiva replied that the killing did not occur in Amba's life at that time, but in Amba's next life. The god said that Amba would be reincarnated to be the one who caused Bhishma's death. After hearing the god's answer, Amba confidently took his own life. Amba was born as Srikandi, the son of King Drupada. In the Mahabharata, Srikandi is an androgynous figure. The story of her gender determination takes place in various versions. In one version it is said that when Srikandi was young, she found a puspamala (a gift from Amba) hanging above the gate of her palace.",

In the middle of the forest, Srikandi prays and changes gender to male. According to another version, he ran away from Panchala, then met a yaksa who then changed his gender to Srikandi. It is said that when he was not blessed with offspring, King Drupada wandered into the forest. There he found a baby girl. When he was picked up, a magical voice echoed from the sky and ordered Drupada to raise the baby like a boy. The child was also given the name Srikandi. As an adult, Srikandi was married to Raja Dasharna's daughter. However, the princess complained to her father that the Srikandi she married was a woman. When the king acts to confirm the truth, Srikandi panics and flees into the forest. There he met a yaksa who agreed to change sex with him. The Yaksa king also knew about this, so he cursed that the yaksa would remain a woman until Srikandi died. In various versions, the gender change causes Srikandi to become eunuchs; in other versions it is not. In some versions, Amba was indeed born as a boy named Srikandi. Sometimes told as a gentleman, sometimes as an eunuch. In another version, Srikandi is indeed a man but has a transgender status, because of Shiva's grace that causes Amba to still remember her previous life.

Before the 10th day of the battle, the Pandavas came to Bisma at night to find out his weakness. Bhishma said that he was reluctant to fight with a woman, or someone with a ladylike name. Besides that, he always stays away from the battlefield whenever Heroine approaches him. Knowing that Bhishma would act in this way towards Srikandi, Arjuna devised a trick to hide behind Srikandi and attack Bhishma with a devastating arrow. On the 10th day of the battle, many warriors from the Korawa army attacked and injured Srikandi, some of whom also confronted the five Pandavas. Drona confronted Arjuna, Duryodana confronted Bima, Salya confronted Yudistira, Wrekasura confronted Nakula, and Uluka confronted Sadewa. First of all, Ashwatthama attacks Srikandi but Drupada fends him off, then Dursasana attacks Srikandi but Drestadyumna fights him off. Lastly, Shakuni attacked and stabbed Srikandi but Virata stopped him. Later, the injured Srikandi finally boarded Arjuna's chariot. Together, they drove towards Bhishma. Seeing Srikandi appear before him, Bhishma lowered his weapon, then Arjuna, who was hiding behind Srikandi, immediately released a barrage of arrow attacks. Thus, only with Srikandi's help, Arjuna was able to deal a death blow to Bhishma, who was virtually invincible to the end. In the epic Mahabharata, it is said that Srikandi continued to survive until the war ended on the 18th day, which was marked by the defeat of Duryodhana in a duel against Bima. Before dying, Duryodhana appointed Aswatama as the leader of the rest of the Korawa warriors, to launch a revenge attack on the Pandawa camp. In the Sauptikaparwa book, it is told that Aswatama carried out the guerrilla while the Pandawa army was sleeping, and succeeded in killing many knights.",

But in general, the meaning of a map is a sheet of all or part of the earth's surface on a flat plane that is reduced using a certain scale. A map is a two-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional space. The science of making maps is called cartography. Many maps have a scale, which determines how large objects on the map actually are. A collection of several maps is called an atlas. Maps have several functions in various fields, including: Maps are a tool for conveying spatial information. Based on this function, a map should be equipped with various components/elements that aim to make it easier for users to read/use the map. Some components of map completeness that are generally found on maps are, for example: Reflecting the content as well as the type of map. Title writing is usually at the top center, top right, or bottom. However, as much as possible put it on the top right. The legend is a description of the symbols which is the key to understanding the map. In general, north is indicated by an arrow pointing up on the map.

Postmodernism is often associated with deconstruction and poststructuralism because its use as a term gained significant popularity at the same time as poststructuralism, namely in the twentieth century. Postmodernism is an understanding that developed after the modern era with its modernism. Postmodernism is not a single understanding or a theory, but rather an umbrella for various scattered theories and it is difficult to find a single common ground. Many figures give the meaning of postmodernism as a continuation of modernism. But the continuation became very mixed. For Lyotard and Geldner, postmodernism is a complete break from modernism. For Derrida, Foucault and Baudrillard, postmodernism is a radical form of modernity which eventually \"turns itself off\" because of the difficulty of homogenizing various theories. For David Graffin, postmodernism is a correction of some aspects of modernism. In addition, for Giddens, postmodernism is a form of modernism that has become self-aware and has become wise. Finally, for Habermas, postmodernism is an unfinished stage of modernism. Based on the origin of the word, postmodernism, comes from English which means understanding (-ism) which developed after (post) modern.

Another form of the word culture is culture which comes from the Latin cultura. Culture is a way of life that develops and is shared by a group of people, and is passed down from generation to generation. Culture is made up of many complex elements, including religious and political systems, customs, languages, tools, clothing, buildings, and works of art. Language, like culture, is an inseparable part of human beings so that many people tend to think that it is genetically inherited. One can communicate with people of different cultures and adjust for the differences between them, thus proving that culture can be learned. Culture is a whole way of life. Culture is complex, abstract, and broad. Many aspects of culture also determine communicative behavior. These socio-cultural elements are scattered and include many human social activities. Some of the reasons why people experience difficulties when communicating with people from other cultures are seen in the definition of culture: Culture is a complex set of values \u200b\u200bpolarized by an image that bears a view of its own privileges.

The term for that opinion is cultural-determinism. Herskovits views culture as something that is passed down from one generation to another, which is then referred to as superorganic. Meanwhile, according to Andreas Eppink, culture contains the whole notion of social values, social norms, knowledge, as well as all social, religious, and other structures, in addition to all intellectual and artistic statements that characterize a society. According to Edward Burnett Tylor, culture is that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, customs, and any other capabilities acquired by a person as a member of society. Selo Soemardjan and Soelaiman Soemardi stated that culture is a means of creation, taste and creation of society. Meanwhile, M.

Based on these forms, culture has several elements or components, according to anthropologist Cateora, namely: The main elements of culture include: Technology concerns ways or techniques of producing, using, and maintaining all tools and equipment. Technology appears in the ways in which humans organize society, in ways of expressing a sense of beauty, or in producing artistic results. Small, nomadic communities or rural communities who live from agriculture are familiar with at least eight kinds of traditional technologies (also called systems of equipment and elements of physical culture), namely means of production, weapons, containers, tools for starting a fire, food. clothing, shelter and housing, and means of transportation Scholars' attention to this livelihood system has focused on traditional livelihood issues, including hunting and gathering, livestock raising, cultivating crops, and fishing. The kinship system is a very important part of the social structure. Meyer Fortes suggests that the kinship system of a society can be used to describe the social structure of the community concerned. Kinship are social units consisting of several families who are related by blood or marriage. Kinship members consist of father, mother, children, in-laws, grandchildren, brothers, sisters, uncles, aunts, grandparents, and so on. In socio-anthropological studies, there are several types of kinship groups, from relatively small to large numbers, such as the grabineal family, clan, fatri, and half of the community.

Language is a tool or cultural embodiment that humans use to communicate or interact with each other, either through writing, orally, or gestures (sign language), with the aim of conveying the intentions of the heart or will to the interlocutor or other people. Through language, humans can adjust to the customs, behavior, manners of society, and at the same time easily assimilate themselves with all forms of society. Language has several functions that can be divided into general functions, and special functions. The function of language in general is as a tool for expression, communication, and a tool for integration and social adaptation, while the function of language in particular is to establish relationships in daily life, to create art (literature), to study ancient texts, and to exploit science and technology. Art refers to the value of beauty (aesthetics) that comes from the expression of human desire for beauty that is enjoyed with the eyes or ears. As creatures with high taste, humans produce various styles of art, ranging from simple to complex artistic manifestations. Sometimes knowledge, understanding, and human physical endurance in mastering and uncovering the secrets of nature are very limited.

Such an order must not violate the French Constitution or the Civil Code, and neither party has the right to request that an order be annulled in the French Council of State. Orders must be ratified by Parliament before they can be turned into legislative Act. Special orders known as d\u00e9cret-loi, literally \"acts-decisions\" or \"laws\", usually considered an illegal practice under the 3rd and 4th Republics, were eventually abolished and replaced by ordinances under the 1958 Constitution Except for the reserved powers of the President (as stated in Article 16 of the 1958 Constitution, so far exercised only once), the executive can issue decisions in areas provided by the constitution as the responsibility of parliament only if the law permits it to do so. In other cases, the order is illegal and, if anyone demands an annulment of the order, it will be overturned by the Council of State. There is a procedure for the prime minister to issue regulations in such areas, but this procedure requires the express approval of the parliament (see Article 38 of the 1958 Constitution). Decrees issued by the Prime Minister take two forms: Sometimes, people call d\u00e9crets en Conseil d'\u00c9tat; not as d\u00e9crets du Conseil d'\u00c9tat.",

Decrees may be classified as: Only the prime minister can issue regulations or application decrees. Presidential Decrees are generally nominations or extraordinary acts where law mandates presidential decrees, such as the dissolving of the French National Assembly, the calling of elections for a new legislature, and the awarding of the title of Marshal of France. Decisions are published in the Journal Officiel de la R\u00e9publique Fran\u00e7aise or in the French Gazette. Decrees (Latin: decretum) in the use of the Catholic Church's canon law have various meanings. Every papal bull, brief, or motu proprio is a decree insofar as these documents are legislative acts. In this sense, the term is quite ancient. The Roman congregation was previously authorized to issue decrees in matters under their special jurisdiction but was prohibited from continuing to do so under Pope Benedict XV in 1917. Each ecclesiastical province as well as each diocese may issue decrees in its periodic synods within the scope of authority. While in a general sense all documents promulgated by an ecumenical council can be called decrees. In a special sense some of these documents, such as those of the Second Vatican Council, are more properly called constitutions or declarations. Canon 29 of the 1983 Code of Canon Law defines general decrees: General decrees, by which a competent legislator makes general provisions for a community capable of accepting a law, are true and regulated laws by the provisions of the canon of law. The Holy See uses decrees from the pope such as papal bulls, papal briefs or motu proprio as legislative acts.

Decrees lose effect from the start if they are not confirmed within 60 days of their publication. However the Council can regulate by law legal relations arising from unconfirmed decisions.\" The effectiveness of 60 days immediately borne fruit, giving rights or hopes whose legal basis was precarious, especially when the law of conversion was never interfered with.

Both terms are usually translated as decree and imposition. According to the 1993 constitution of the Russian Federation, ukaz is a presidential decree Such a Ukaze has the force of law, nonetheless i may not change the Russian constitution or existing statutes, and may be superseded by laws passed by the Federal Assembly. The Russian government can also issue decrees, which are officially called postanovlyeniya (Russian: \u041f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f) or rasnoryazhyeniya (Russian: \u0420\u0430\u0441\u043f\u043e\u0440\u044f\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f) and may not conflict with the constitution/laws or presidential decrees.

        "paragraph": "One of the important amendments made in the constitution with law No.6771 is related to presidential decrees. In the United Kingdom, the Orders-in-Council (English: decrees in council) is one of the principal pieces of legislation whose authority derives from the Royal Prerogative, promulgated by the Privy Council on behalf of the King; or secondary legislation, promulgated by the Minister of the Crown using powers conferred by an Act of Parliament or other primary legislation. Both are subject to judicial review, the former with a few exceptions. In United States law usage, during the 19th and early 20th centuries, an edict was an order from an equality court to determine the rights of parties to a lawsuit, according to fairness and good conscience. Since the 1938 merger of procedural law and justice in federal courts under the federal rules of civil procedure, the term judgment (a parallel term in common law) has generally replaced decree. This is now also true in most state courts. The term decree is widely treated as synonymous with judgment. A decision is often a final decision, but there are also interim decisions. The final decree fully and finally governs the entire litigation, determines all the questions raised by the case, and leaves nothing out that requires further judicial action; it can also be appealed. Interlocutory decisions are interim decisions or preliminary decisions that are not final and do not fully determine a lawsuit, so some further processing is required before the final decree can be entered. Usually not appealed, although preliminary orders by federal courts can be appealed even if they are interlocutory. Executive orders, which are instructions from the President to the executive branch of government, are decisions in a general sense that have the force of law, although they cannot override statutory or constitutional statutes and are subject to judicial review.",

It is said that he was one of the ministers in the government of Dhritarashtra. This character is told in the story of the attempted assassination of the Pandavas, the main character of the Mahabharata. Purocana's name is mentioned in Adiparwa, the first volume of the Mahabharata. It is said that he was recruited by Duryodhana to build a flammable palace, or laksagreha. The palace was planned to be burned after the Pandavas were persuaded to stay in it. This idea was first coined by Duryodhana's uncle, Shakuni, who was jealous of the Pandavas. Duryodhana and Shakuni also asked Purocana's help as a firelighter to burn the laksagreha. According to Hindu mythology, in a previous life (reincarnation), Purocana was born as Prahasta, a giant warrior who was accomplished and mighty, and was one of the governors/commanders trusted by King Ravana, an antagonist whose story is found in the Ramayana. So in his two reincarnations, he has lived the life of the evil figure's right-hand man. In the Mahabharata, Adiparwa's first book, it is told that there was a dispute in the Kuru Dynasty, between the sons of Dretarastra (Korawa) led by Duryodana, and the sons of Pandu (Pandavas) led by Yudistira. In an attempt to eliminate the Pandavas, Duryodhana plans to kill them in a fire, and make it appear that the fire was an accident. So he ordered Purocana to make a palace out of combustible materials, with the main constituent being shellac (a kind of resin, or wax). The construction site is in Waranawata. Then after conspiring with Duryodhana and Shakuni, Dhritarastra persuaded the Pandavas and their mother (Kunti) to take a vacation to Waranawata, as well as witness the festival that was taking place there.",

In the middle of the river, Resi Parasara was captivated by Satyawati's beauty. Satyawati then conversed with Resi Parasara, telling him that he had an illness that caused his body to stink. Satyawati's father advised that any man who could cure his illness could become a husband. Hearing this, Resi Parasara said that he was willing to cure Satyawati's illness.

Hindus view Krishna Dwaipayana as the character who divided the Vedas into four parts (Caturveda), and because of this he also has the name Weda Wyasa which means \"Divider of the Vedas\". The word Wyasa means \"to split\", \"to split\", \"to distinguish\". In the process of codifying the Vedas, Wyasa was assisted by four of his students, namely Pulaha, Jaimini, Samantu, and Wesampayana. It has been debated whether Wyasa was the name of a person or the class of scholars who divided the Vedas. The Vishnu Purana has an interesting theory about Wyasa. According to the Hindu view, the universe is a cycle, existing and non-repeating. Each cycle is presided over by several Manus, one for each Manvantara, who have four ages, called Caturyuga (four Yugas). Dwaparayuga is the third Yuga. The Puranas (Book 3, Chanto 3) say: Apart from being known as the person who divided the Vedas into four parts, Vyasa is also known as the author (recorder) of the history of the Mahabharata, but he is also an important figure in the chronicles he composed. His mother (Satyawati) married Santanu, King of Hastinapura. From their marriage, Citr\u0101nggada and Wicitrawirya were born. Citr\u0101nggada died in a battle, while Wicitrawirya died due to illness. Since the two princes had died childless, Satyawati summoned Vyasa to perform a yadnya (sacred ceremony) to beget children. The two Wicitrawirya widows, namely Ambika and Ambalika, were asked to face Byasa alone for a ceremony. According to the rules of the ceremony, first Ambika faced Vyasa. Because he was afraid to see Vyasa's great face, he closed his eyes. Because Ambika blindfolded her during the ceremony, Vyasa says that Ambika's child will be born blind. Then Ambalika turned to Vyasa. Previously, Satyawati reminded Ambika not to close her eyes so that her child would not be born blind like what happened to Ambika.",

Because the two children were physically unwell, Satyawati asked Vyasa to perform the ceremony one more time. This time, Ambika and Ambalika did not want to face Vyasa, but they ordered a maid of honor to represent them. The ladies-in-waiting remained calm during the ceremony, so their child was born healthy, and was named Widura. When Gandari was upset because she had not yet given birth, while Kunti had already given birth to Pandu, her womb was beaten. Then, a lump of flesh was born by Gandari. With Vyasa's help, the meat was cut into a hundred pieces. Then each part is put in a jug and planted in the ground. A year later, the jug was taken back. From it came the baby who was then raised as the son of Dhritarashtra. Vyasa lived in a forest in the Kurukshetra region, and was very close to the location of Bharatayuddha, so he knew in detail how things were on the battlefield of Bharatayuddha, because it happened before his own eyes. After the battle ended, Aswatama ran and took refuge in Vyasa's hostel. Soon Arjuna and the Pandavas followed him. There they fight. Both Arjuna and Aswatama took out the sacred Brahmastra weapon. Because Vyasa prevented them, their fight stopped. At one point, Resi Byasa's wish arose to compile a history of the Bharata family.

Nearly two-thirds of the entire collection is by French painters, and more than 1,200 works by Northern European painters. Italian paintings dominate the collections belonging to Francis I and Louis XIV, some are works of art that have not been returned since the time of Napoleon, and some are purchased. The collection belonged to Francis I, mostly obtained from famous Italian painters such as Raphael and Michelangelo, and Leonardo da Vinci brought to his court. After the French Revolution, the royal collection became the centerpiece of the Louvre. When the d'Orsay train station was converted into the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay in 1986, the museum collection was divided, and works created after 1848 were transferred to the new museum. Artwork produced by French and Northern European painters was housed in the Richelieu and Cour Carr\u00e9e wings; while Spanish and Italian painters were placed on the first floor of the Denon wing. Some of the museum's finest works have been digitized by the French Museums Research and Restoration Center. The Print and Drawing Arts Department focuses more on works done on paper. The origin of the museum's collection is the works contained in the royal collection (Cabinet du Roi) totaling 8,600 pieces, which were increased by purchases made by the state, such as the purchase of 1,200 from Fillipo Baldinucci's collection in 1806, and donations. The department opened on 5 August 1797 with 415 pieces in the collection on display at the Galerie d'Apollon. The collection is divided into three sections: core, Cabinet du Roi, 14,000 copper plate printing, and a donation from Edmond de Rothschild, including 40,000 prints, 3,000 drawings, and 5,000 picture books.",

Medical terms related to blood begin with the word hemo- or hemato- which comes from the Greek haima which means blood. Blood is a suspension of cells and cytoplasmic fragments in a liquid called Plasma. Overall blood can be considered as a connective tissue in a broad sense, because basically it consists of elements of cells and intercellular substance in the form of plasma. The main function of blood is to transport oxygen needed by cells throughout the body. Blood also supplies body tissues with nutrients, transports waste products of metabolism, and contains various building blocks for the immune system which aims to defend the body from various diseases. Human blood is red, between bright red when it is rich in oxygen to dark red when it is deficient in oxygen. The red color of blood is caused by hemoglobin, a respiratory protein, which is found in red blood cells and contains iron in the heme form, to which oxygen molecules bind. In insects, blood (or better known as hemolymph) is not involved in oxygen circulation. Oxygen in insects is circulated through the tracheal system in the form of channels that deliver air directly to body tissues. Insect blood transports substances to body tissues and removes metabolic waste materials. In other animals, the main function of blood is to transport oxygen from the lungs or gills to the body tissues. The blood contains hemoglobin which functions as a binder of oxygen. In some invertebrates or small invertebrates, oxygen permeates directly into the blood plasma because the oxygen-carrying proteins are freely dissolved.",

Humans have a closed circulatory system which means blood flows in blood vessels and is circulated by the heart. Blood is pumped by the heart to the lungs to release metabolic waste in the form of carbon dioxide and absorb oxygen through the pulmonary arteries, then brought back to the heart via the pulmonary veins. After that the blood is delivered throughout the body by the aortic blood vessels. Blood carries oxygen throughout the body through fine blood vessels called capillaries. Blood then returns to the heart via the superior vena cava and inferior vena cava. Blood also transports metabolic waste materials, drugs and foreign chemicals to the liver to be broken down and taken to the kidneys to be excreted as urine.

The incident began after Wena became a tyrannical king, he was hunted down and eventually died. Having no offspring, the rishis squeezed Wena's body in a ceremony and hoped that a miracle would come. When Wena's right thigh was squeezed, a scary black dwarf creature appeared, which was Wena's bad side. When his right hand was squeezed, a handsome boy appeared. His birth was celebrated with the appearance of a bow, arrows and staff. The child that appeared was called Pertu. Her partner, Arcisa, also emerged from Wena's body.

Knowledge includes, but is not limited to descriptions, hypotheses, concepts, theories, principles and procedures that are Bayesian Probability correct or useful. In another sense, knowledge is a variety of symptoms encountered and obtained by humans through the observation of reason. Knowledge arises when a person uses his mind to recognize certain objects or events that have never been seen or felt before. For example, when someone tastes a new dish that he is familiar with, he will gain knowledge about the shape, taste, and aroma of the dish. Knowledge is information that has been combined with understanding and the potential to act; which then sticks in someone's mind. In general, knowledge has the ability to predict something as a result of recognizing a pattern. Where information and data only have the ability to inform or even cause confusion, then knowledge has the ability to direct action. This is called the potential to act. Knowledge possessed by a person, of course, comes from various sources. Here are the sources of knowledge: In the view of the philosophers, reason is the source of knowledge. This view arises from the fact that knowledge is not formed by soul and matter. Therefore, knowledge must be sourced from a substance that is not material in terms of substance or actualization. The degree of this source of knowledge must be higher than that of the soul. This is based on the view that the soul in its actualization is still bound by matter. This substance is then referred to as reason. Especially in the subject matter of Knowledge Management, there are two main types of knowledge when viewed from their explicitity: Implicit knowledge is knowledge that is still embedded in the form of one's experience and contains factors that are not real such as personal beliefs, perspectives, and principles.",

The ability to speak, design, or operate complex machines or tools requires knowledge that cannot always be seen explicitly, nor is it so easy to transfer it to others explicitly. A simple example of implicit knowledge is the ability to ride a bicycle. Common knowledge of how to ride a bicycle is that in order to balance, if the bicycle turns to the left, then point the steering wheel to the right. To turn right, first turn the steering wheel to the left a little, then when the bike is leaning to the right, turn the steering wheel to the right. But knowing that alone is not enough for a beginner to be able to steer a bicycle. A person who has implicit knowledge is usually unaware that he actually has it and also how that knowledge can benefit others. To get it, learning and skills are needed, but not necessarily in written forms. Implicit knowledge often contains customs and culture of which we are not even aware. Explicit knowledge is knowledge that has been documented or stored in a tangible form in the form of media or the like. It has been articulated in formal language and can be disseminated relatively easily. Information stored in encyclopedias (including Wikipedia) is a great example of explicit knowledge. The most common forms of explicit knowledge are instructions for use, procedures, and how-to videos. Knowledge can also be mediated audio-visually. Art work and product design can also be seen as a form of explicit knowledge which is an externalization of human skills, motives and knowledge.

After eating it, he turned into a sea god. His appearance also changed. His legs turned into fish tails and fins appeared on his body. As a result, since then, Glaukos has had to live at sea. Glaukos was initially displeased with the change in his appearance, but the other sea gods welcomed him and accepted him as a new member of the sea god ranks. Glaukos also learned the art of divination from the other sea gods. Glaukos fell in love with a nymph named Skilla. But Skilla was afraid of Glaukos' appearance and always stayed away from him. Glaukos also asked for help from Kirke the witch. Kirke herself actually loves Glaukos and tries to convince him to forget Skilla. However, Glaukos is already in love with Skilla.

Acne is a skin disease with a large number of sufferers. No one in the world goes through their life without a pimple on their skin. \"The possible cause is hormonal changes that stimulate the oil glands in the skin. Other hormonal changes that can trigger acne are menstruation, pregnancy, use of birth control pills, and stress. Acne does not always appear because it is dirty, but rather is caused by factors from within the body. Acne is an abnormal condition of the skin due to excessive interference with the production of oil glands (sebaceous glands) which causes blockage of the hair follicle ducts and skin pores. The most common causes of acne are hormones, piles of oil or sebum on the skin collaborate with bacteria. Genetic factors also affect each individual's sebum production by around 50-90%. Generally, acne is caused by an excess of oil glands due to the active production of androgen hormones. Acne occurs because the excess oil glands mix with dead skin cells. When the skin cells mix with the increased amount of dust or dirt, the mixture is thick and sticky. it can form plugs that become black or white spots. Many people think that acne only affects the face, but acne can also attack other parts of the body, such as the back, chest and upper arms. To complicate matters, a bacteria normally present on the skin, called P. acne, tends to multiply in the clogged sebaceous glands, which produce substances that irritate the surrounding area. The glands continue to swell, and may burst. then spread the inflammation to the skin of the surrounding area. This is what causes cystic acne the most likely type, which leaves long-term pigmentation and scars like smallpox that are permanent.",

The foundation contained in the powder causes the powder to easily clog the pores. Consumption of corticosteroid drugs, both oral (drinking) and topical (topical), which causes a decrease in the body's resistance, also increases the potential for acne to develop due to increased activity of pathogenic bacteria. Drugs that can cause acne are lithium, steroids, and anticonvulsants. The surface of a cell phone can be a fertile medium for the growth of bacteria. To prevent this, clean the surface of the phone regularly with alcohol, and try not to hold the cell phone to your cheek when calling. In fact, stress doesn't directly cause acne. The problem is, there are certain hormones that are released when someone is stressed, which allows the growth of acne. Not only that, stress makes the person have an eating pattern that tends to consume lots of sweet and fatty foods, as an \"escape\" from stress. Acne can also be caused by hormonal disorders, anything that results in hormonal imbalances will trigger acne, both stress (physical and psychological), use of birth control pills, certain diseases such as polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and even pregnancy. Apart from dehydration, the skin can be dry due to lack of fluids, so this is one of the benefits of drinking water. If the skin is experiencing dryness, especially around the face, then this is also the cause of the presence of acne on the face.

In the field of philosophy, epistemology includes discussions about the origin, sources, scope, value validity, and truth of knowledge. Epistemology studies the nature of knowledge, justification, and the rationality of beliefs. Epistemology has become widely discussed in various fields, epistemology is centered into four areas, namely 1) Philosophical analysis related to the nature of knowledge and how this is related to conceptions such as truth, belief, and justification, 2) Various problems of skepticism, 3) Sources and scope of knowledge and justification for belief, and 4) Criteria for knowledge and justification. Epistemology addresses questions such as, \"What makes justifiable truths justifiable?\", \"What does it mean to say that someone knows something?\", and the fundamental question, \"How do we know that we know?\". The term 'Epistemology' was introduced to the philosophical field by the Scottish philosopher James Frederick Ferrier in 1854. However, according to Brett Warren, King James VI of Scotland had previously taken this philosophical concept by heart and personified it, with the term Epistemon, in 1591. In a In a philosophical debate, King James VI of Scotland wrote the character Epistemon as the personification of a philosophical concept to respond to a debate by arguing whether the perceptions developed by the ancient religion of witchcraft should be punished in the presence of Christian society. King James' argument shows that through the character of Epistemon, who bases his argument on theological ideas regarding reasoning and beliefs that develop in society, meanwhile his opponent Philomathes takes a philosophical stance on legal aspects in society, but seeks to gain greater knowledge of Epistemon, the Greek term for scientist.",

So epistemology is \"the theory of knowledge\" or the theory of knowledge. Using the term, epistemology is a branch of philosophy of science that examines and discusses the nature of science or knowledge about knowledge (scientific knowledge). The term terminologically, the word epistemology in English: \"epistemology\" which is the part of philosophy that deals with knowledge. Epistemology in Webster's New International Dictionary online, epistemology is defined as a study or theory regarding the nature and basis of knowledge, especially with reference to its limits and validity. Meanwhile, in terms of Indonesian terminology, the word epistemology in the online Big Indonesian Dictionary (KBBI) is defined as a branch of philosophy concerning the basis and limits of knowledge.

In the Jena period (1794-1799), this term was used by thinkers named Johann Fichte and Bernard Bolzano for their various projects.

It was very different, however, in that it dispensed with the notion of positioning myself in favor of a total tendency towards the 'arrhythmization' of the field of science itself. Then the word \"epistemology\" first appeared in 1847, in a review in New York's Eclectic Magazine. It was first used as a translation of the word Wissenschaftslehre as it appears in the philosophical novel by the German writer Jean Paul. James Frederick Ferrier was a Scottish philosopher. Ferrier first discussed epistemology in the Anglophone philosophical school in Scotland in 1854, the application of which was carried out as a study in the Institutes of Metaphysics namely the application of epistemology as a model of 'ontology', he determined that epistemology is a branch of philosophy which aims to find the meaning of knowledge, and called it ' the true beginning' of philosophy. In mathematics, it is known that 2 + 2 = 4, but there are also ways to know how to add two numbers, and to know people (for example, yourself), places (for example, a village), objects (for example, a car), or activities (for example, , addition). Some philosophers think there is an important distinction between \"knowing that\" (knowing concepts), \"knowing how\" (understanding operations), and \"proximity-to-knowledge\" (knowing by relationships), with an epistemology primarily concerned with the former. While these distinctions are not explicit in English, they are explicitly defined in other languages \u200b\u200b(Note: some languages \u200b\u200brelated to English manage to retain this word, for example in Scottish: \"wit\" and \"ken\").

This verb seems to be the most appropriate in terms of describing \"episteme\" in one of the modern European languages, hence in German terms it is called \"Erkenntnistheorie\". This theory of linguistic interpretation and meaning remains controversial today. In his paper On Denoting and later book Problems of Philosophy Bertrand Russell emphasized the difference between \"knowledge by information\" and \"knowledge by proximity\". Gilbert Ryle is also credited with emphasizing the difference between knowing how and knowing that in The Concept of Mind. In Personal Knowledge, Michael Polanyi argues about the epistemological relevance of knowledge and how knowledge is; Using the example of the balance involved in riding a bicycle, he shows that theoretical knowledge of the physics involved in maintaining a state of balance cannot be a substitute for practical knowledge of how to ride, and that it is important to understand how these two things happen and work.

On the basis of this basic philosophy, other branches of science were born, such as mathematics, logic or logic, medicine, and others. Epistemology is the origin of the word \"epist\u0113m\u0113\" in Greek which means knowledge. This flow is broadly divided into two main streams namely idealism and realism. First, idealism or known as rationalism is a school that refers to the role of reason, ideas, categories, and forms as a source of knowledge. Second, realism, also known as empiricism, is a school that refers to the role of the senses, be it sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste, as sources as well as tools for acquiring knowledge. The leaders of these schools of thought sometimes defend the beliefs of their thinkers and are sometimes very exclusive in uncovering the truth. The ancient Greek century was dominated by three thought leaders namely Socrates, Plato and Aristotle using the method of inductive critical dialectical maieutics. The Socratic method, also known as the dialectical method (maieutika tekhne) or the midwifery method, originated with Socrates (470-399 BC) who was a Greek philosopher in the 5th century BC and was later shown in dialogues written by his student Plato. Socrates achieved notoriety for engaging others in conversations whose purpose was to define broad (universal) ideas such as virtue, beauty, justice, courage, and friendship by discussing ambiguity and complexity. A thing can be given an understanding by making observations of related behavior. So, he gave rise to general knowledge as true knowledge, and specific knowledge as knowledge of relative truth. The arrival of Plato (428-347 BC) announced the Socratic method so that it became a theory of ideas, namely Plato's version of Dinge an sich theory.",

He studies epistemology by trying to understand what must be known, and how knowledge (as opposed to mere correct opinion) is good for those who know. So, according to Aristotle, knowledge is the result of an observation, many and changeable. So next came Aristotle (382-322 BC), he developed from Plato into a theory of science. According to Aristotle, knowledge is the result of an activity of human observation carried out by observing reality and releasing universal elements from particulars. This becomes an abstraction in which humans leave the field of the senses and pass through the level of conjecture until they finally get a true episteme. Only then can epistemological logic be realized thanks to his work called To Organom, containing the theory of the deductive syllogistic method. Aristotle's five logical presentations in the manual are called Organoms covering Categories, About Interpretation, Prior Analysis, Posterior Analysis (Bayes Analysis), Topics, and About Sophisticated Refutations. Then comes the decadence of logic. The development of logic always goes hand in hand with the development of science which has created complex thinking activities that must be considered at every step. Ren\u00e9 Descartes, who is considered the founder of modern Western philosophy, expressed the view that organisms are machines built on top of discrete parts that still have a dominant conceptual framework. The physical universe, including living organisms, is a machine for Descartes, and can in principle be fully understood by analyzing its smallest parts. The mechanistic view of contemporary economics is characterized by the fragmentational and reductionist methods, which are emblematic of much of the social sciences. Living systems consist of humans and their natural resources in constant interaction with each other, most of which are living organisms.",

        "paragraph": "A fragmented mechanical worldview denies complete living systems and emphasizes the importance of a lifestyle in harmony with the ecological and social environment. The view of science in the Eastern world is more concerned with ecological and social harmony, harmony and unity between humans and the external environment. Humans as living beings are individuals as one small part of the world (microcosm) which is in a very broad universe (macrocosm). The Eastern worldview sees the world from a relationship and integration perspective. Organisms are self-regulating systems, meaning that their structure and functional arrangements are determined not by the environment, but by the system itself. For example, the system determines its scale trend based on the principle of internal control that is not affected by the environment. The view of living systems as networks brings a new perspective called natural hierarchy. The development and progress of science that has been achieved has given birth to several other scientific disciplines that have emerged from the main philosophy, which consists of three main components, namely Ontology (Theory of nature), Epistemology (Scientific Theory) and Axiology (Theory of value). Rationalism is a stream that emphasizes reason as a source of knowledge. Rationalism is a school of philosophy of science which states that truth can be obtained only through the results of proof, logic and analysis of facts. All sources of knowledge in rationalism come from reason or must be rational. The development of rational thinking patterns in learning is obtained through the learning process with learning methods that use scientific stages, namely observing, collecting data, determining hypotheses, analyzing data, drawing conclusions, communicating what has been obtained. The main thinker of this school is Rene Descartes (1596-1650), a modern philosophical thinker. In his famous words, namely Cogito Ergo Sum \"I think, therefore I exist\".",

Then he revived thought in Western philosophy by saying that truth is an act of reason. Because with reason, one can reach the truth, which means one should not believe in things beyond human reason. To reach the truth, three innate ideas are needed, including the idea of \u200b\u200bthought, the idea of \u200b\u200bGod as a perfect being, and the idea of \u200b\u200bvastness. It is these 3 categories of innate ideas that become the axioms of knowledge in the philosophy of rationalism whose truth is beyond doubt. Empiricism is a school that holds that human knowledge is obtained through an experience or observation of the senses. Indra is obtained from the empirical nature and collected in humans to become an experience. As for the empiricists, among others: John Locke (1632-1704) made the basis of empiricism as a thinking process. In 1669, in his book entitled Essay Concerning Human Understanding with the main premise, it was stated that all knowledge is obtained through experience. Locke's thinking contradicts the innate ideas as a source of knowledge put forward by Descartes so that he rejects the existence of these innate ideas. According to Locke's view, experience is divided into two, namely: external experience in the form of sensation and inner experience in the form of reflection or reflection. Through the association process of the two experiences, a more complex idea will be formed. David Hume (1711-1776), a British thinker who continued the tradition of empiricism. Hume argued that simple ideas are copies of simple sensations or of simple ideas or complex impressions. The empirical thoughts he put forward were radical. He interprets the substance of knowledge as a repetition of experience so that the whole knowledge is a total experience. David Hume's views tend to be skeptical because he only recognizes the results of knowledge by the senses broadly.",

The figures of this school include August Comte, who has a view that the history of the development of human thought can be grouped into three stages, namely: 1) The theological stage, in which humans still believe in absolute knowledge or knowledge. Humans at this stage are still controlled by superstitions so that subjects and objects are not distinguished. 2) Metaphysical Stage, namely human thought trying to understand and think about reality, but has not been able to prove it with facts. 3) The Positive Stage, which is marked by human thinking to find laws and mutual relations through facts. Therefore, at this stage human knowledge can develop and be proven through facts. Comte argued, positivism is a worldview in understanding the world based on science. This arrangement of levels can be continuously developed so that each new science will depend on the previous stage. Positivists believe that there is little (if any) difference between the social sciences and the natural sciences, because society and social life operate according to rules, and so does nature. Skepticism is a school of thought that emphasizes doctrine as indeterminate knowledge, a method of deferred judgment, structured doubt, or the characteristics of skeptical criticism. Whereas in philosophy, skepticism can refer to methods of inquiry that emphasize critical scrutiny, prudence, and intellectual rigor. Skepticism begins with the claim that one does not know the propositions one normally thinks one knows. Claiming that the senses are deceptive or misleading. However, in modern times it has developed into methodical (systematic) skepticism which requires evidence before an experience is acknowledged as true.",

In other words, the truth of knowledge should be associated with benefits and as a means for an action. The truth of knowledge must be carried out by a planned action. Often, people who have a pragmatic nature, an action that is carried out will be expected to be achieved immediately without thinking without a certain time process, so that the results of the truth are sometimes wrong or miss. The thinkers who introduced pragmatism included: Charles Sanders Peirce (1839-1914), known as the \"inventor\" or pioneer of pragmatism from America. Peirce was also a logician who reintroduced semiotics as part of linguistics. Pierce stated that the most important essence of pragmatism is that any statement has a benefit (meaning), that statement must have a practical bearing, planned. The truth of the knowledge described is something that is obtained regarding the results that can be witnessed and observed. John Dewey (1859-1952), known as a major influential figure in modern pragmatist thought. The pragmatic thinking developed by Dewey is also known as experimentalism. This naming comes from his thinking which states that human growth is the goal of education. He calls it growth because he thinks that everything in this world is always changing. John Dewey's pragmatic thinking became one of the thoughts that influenced the start of mass education. William James (1824-1910), known as the father of pragmatism. James argues that pragmatism is an attempt to unite science and philosophy so that it is more scientific and useful for practical life. Then, it develops and applies to life its life-sustaining uses.

The benefits of studying epistemology in influencing scientific progress and civilization. This is due to the fact that epistemology helps in building both modern and traditional societies without overriding the key role of epistemology in preventing civilization stagnation, new creations, and original findings. Three reasons to be considered in studying epistemology include strategic, cultural, and educational. First, strategic consideration of epistemology is in order to understand the importance of science for humans both in terms of the benefits and acquisition of knowledge. Second, cultural considerations of epistemology are in order to be able to understand and express the meaning contained in cultural expressions, both cultural meanings in the form of writing, speech and symbols. Third, educational consideration of epistemology is a conscious effort in a central view, where education is characterized by a process starting from establishing a vision and mission, curriculum, learning outcomes to be achieved, determining subjects to be studied, to evaluating learning outcomes. From this process will guide, sharpen, and assist in understanding science in a structured way. Operationally and explicitly, the concept of epistemology is studied in the application of the scientific method. The scientific method methodologically includes thoughts, patterns, techniques, and stages as a basis for developing existing knowledge or acquiring new knowledge. As for the procedure for obtaining and developing it, the scientific method, namely: a) The preparation of knowledge results includes a logical frame of mind with consistent arguments, b) Deduction from the frame of mind is described based on hypotheses, c) Statements from hypotheses are verified, then tested for factual truth.",

Some of the Indian legends involving Jamadagni are the tale of the struggle over a magic cow and the execution of Renuka, Jamadagni's wife. The story of the struggle for a magic cow involving Jamadagni and Kartawirya Arjuna is similar to the legend about the dispute between King Wiswamitra and Rishi Wasista. Once upon a time, King Kartawirya Arjuna and his troops from the Hehaya Kingdom came to visit the Jamadagni hostel. The sage served him with great reverence. When Kartawirya Arjuna asked Jamadagni to give him the magic cow Kamadhenu who was in the hostel, Jamadagni firmly refused. Because he had the ambition to own the Kamadhenu cow, Kartawirya Arjuna took the path of violence. The cow was taken by force. Parasurama became angry when he learned that Kartawirya Arjuna was going to take his father's cow. Parasurama took the ax that Shiva had given him, then cut off Kartawirya Arjuna's thousand arms, then beheaded him. One morning, Renuka failed to provide water for the ceremony to be held by Jamadagni. Jamadagni requested that his son punish his mother. Apart from Parasurama, all of Jamadagni's sons were unwilling to punish their mother. Finally Jamadagni cursed them to stone. After Parasurama succeeded in beheading his mother, his father gave Parasurama the opportunity to ask for two boons. This opportunity was utilized as well as possible by Parasurama. First, Parasurama requested that his brothers be turned back into humans. Second, Parasurama requested that his mother be revived. There are several versions regarding Jamadagni's death.

Angola's area is almost twice the size of the island of Borneo; is ranked 22nd in the world (after Niger and before Mali). The country is one of the world's major coffee producers and is one of the richest countries in Africa thanks to its natural resources, especially iron ore, diamonds and copper. The early settlers of this area were the Khoisan hunter-gatherer tribe. They were massively replaced by the Bantu during the Bantu migration. In present-day Angola, Portugal made a stop in 1483 on the Congo River, where the Congo, Ndongo and Lunda States were located. The country of the Congo stretched from modern Gabon in the north to the Kwanza River in the south. In 1575 Portugal established a Portuguese colony in Luanda based on the slave trade. The Portuguese gradually took control of the coastline throughout the 16th century through a series of treaties and wars. They formed the Angolan colony. The Dutch occupied Luanda between 1641-48, giving impetus to anti-Portuguese states. In 1648 Portugal retook Luanda and began a process of military conquest in the Congo and Ndongo states that ended with a Portuguese victory in 1671.

South African troops allied with UNITA and invaded Angola in August 1975 to ensure that there was no encroachment (by the newly independent Angolan state) on Namibia, then still under South African occupation (Hodges, 2001, 11). The Soviet Union began assisting the MPLA and providing much of the economic support, while Cuban troops arrived to support the MPLA in October 1975, putting them in control of the capital, Luanda, and keeping South African forces at bay. The MPLA declared itself to be the de facto government of the country when formal independence was declared in November, with Agostinho Neto as first president. In 1976, the FNLA was defeated by combined MPLA and Cuban forces, leaving UNITA (backed by the United States and South Africa) and the Marxist MPLA fighting for power. Conflict broke out, fueled by Cold War geopolitics and by the ability of the two parties to access Angola's natural resources.

However, pantheism is characterized by various doctrines in terms of the relationship between reality and divinity. The concept of pantheistic has existed for thousands of years, and pantheistic elements have been recognized in various religious traditions. The term pantheism was coined by the mathematician Joseph Raphson in 1697, and since then has been used to describe the beliefs of various people and organizations. Pantheism was popularized in Western culture as a theological and philosophical view based on the book by 17th century philosopher Baruch Spinoza, \"Ethics\".

Spinoza held the monist view, according to which the two were identical, and monism was a fundamental part of his philosophy. He is described as a \"man intoxicated with God,\" and uses the word God to describe the unity of all substance. This view influenced philosophers such as Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, who said, \"You are either a Spinozist or you are not a philosopher at all.\" Spinoza has been hailed as one of the great rationalists of 17th century philosophy and one of the most important thinkers of Western philosophy. Although the term \"pantheism\" was not coined until after his death, he is considered to be the most famous proponent of the concept. Ethics is the main source of the spread of pantheism in the West. Heinrich Heine, in his Concerning the History of Religion and Philosophy in Germany (1833\u20131836), writes that \"I do not remember where I read that Herder once exploded with rage at his constant fascination with Spinoza, \"If only Goethe had taken some Latin book besides Spinoza!\" But this did not apply only to Goethe; quite a number of his friends, who later became famous as poets also paid homage to pantheism in their youth, and this doctrine developed actively in German art before attaining supremacy as a philosophical theory.\" Johann Wolfgang von Goethe rejected the Jacobi belief in God as \"the hollow sentiments of the child's brain\" (Goethe 15/1:446) and, in \"Studie nach Spinoza\" (1785/86), argued for the identity of being and the whole.",

A generation earlier, Giordano Bruno conveyed a similar message to mankind. Bruno was however only a beautiful episode in the history of human thought, while Spinoza was one of his strongest strengths. Bruno was both a rhapsodist and a poet, surrounded by artistic emotion; however, Spinoza, was spiritus purus and, in his methods, the prototype of the philosopher.\" The first known use of the term \"pantheism\" in Latin (\"pantheismus\") was by the English mathematician Joseph Raphson in his work De Spatio Reali seu Ente Infinito, published in 1697. Raphson distinguished between \"panhylists\" atheists (from the Greek root pan, \"all\", and hyle, \"matter\"), who believed that everything was material, and Spinozan \"pantheist\" who believed in \"a certain universal substance, matter and intelligence, which constitutes all existing things from its own essence.\" Raphson argued that the universe was immeasurable by human comprehension capacity, and he believed that humans could never comprehend it.

During the early 19th century, pantheism was the perspective shared by many prominent writers and philosophers, drawing on figures such as William Wordsworth and Samuel Coleridge in England; Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Schelling and Hegel in Germany; Knut Hamsun in Norway; and Walt Whitman, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau in the United States. Seeing as a growing threat by the Vatican, in 1864, pantheism was officially condemned by Pope Pius IX in the Syllabus of Errors.

The Stoics too were pantheists, from Zeno of Citium to the king-philosopher Marcus Aurelius. During the pre-Christian Roman Empire, Stoicism was one of the three dominant philosophical schools, along with Epicureanism and Neoplatonism. The early Taoism of Laozi and Zhuangzi is also sometimes considered pantheistic although it is closer to Panentheism. Cheondoism, which emerged during the Korean Joseon Dynasty, and Won Buddhism are also considered pantheistic. The Canadian Realist Society believes that a conscious universe is a reality. This is also an alternative view of Pantheism. In a letter written to Eduard B\u00fcsching (25 October 1929), in reply after B\u00fcsching sent Albert Einstein a copy of his book Es gibt keinen Gott (\"There is no God\"), Einstein wrote, \"We Spinoza followers see our God in miracles, regularity and the validity of all that exists and is in his soul Beseeltheit] as it manifests itself in men and animals.\" According to Einstein, B\u00fcsching's book only discusses the concept of personal God and not God in the perspective of impersonal pantheism.",

What is certain is that a belief in the rationality and clarity of the world, akin to a religious feeling, lies behind all scientific work of a higher order. . . . ] This firm belief, this deeply feeling bound faith, in the superior thought which expresses itself in the world of experience, represents my conception of God. In common parlance this could be described as \"pantheistic\" (Spinoza). In the late 20th century, some scholars suggested that pantheism was the theology underlying Neopaganism, and pantheists began to form organizations devoted to pantheism and treat it as a separate religion.

According to some pantheists, there are elements of pantheism in some forms of Christianity. Ideas similar to pantheism also exist in East/South Asian religions before the 18th century (especially Sikhism, Hinduism, Confucianism and Taoism). While there is no evidence that these religions influenced Spinoza's work, there is evidence that these views influenced other contemporary philosophers, such as Leibniz, and later Voltaire. In Hinduism, the pantheistic view coexists with thepantheistic, polytheistic, monotheistic and atheistic views. In Sikhism, the stories attributed to Guru Nanak show that he believed God to be omnipresent in the physical world, and the Sikh tradition usually depicts God as a perpetuating force in the physical world, present in all material forms, each created as a manifestation from God.

The word migraine comes from the Greek \u1f21\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03b1 (hemikrania), ie \"pain on one side of the head\", from \u1f21\u03bc\u03b9- (hemi-), \"half\", and \u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03bf\u03bd (kranion), \"skull\". Signs of migraine headaches are unilateral (only on one half of the head), throbbing, and lasting from 2 to 72 hours. Accompanying symptoms include nausea, vomiting, photophobia (increased sensitivity to light), phonophobia (increased sensitivity to sound) and the pain gets worse with physical activity. About a third of migraine headache sufferers experience an aura: a kind of visual, sensory, speech, or movement/motor disturbance that signals that the headache is coming soon. Migraines are believed to occur as a result of a combination of environmental and genetic factors. Approximately two-thirds of cases occur in people who are already married. Fluctuating hormone levels can also play a role: migraines are slightly more common in teenage boys than in prepubertal women, but in adults, they are about two to three times more common in women than men. Migraine tendencies usually diminish during pregnancy. The exact mechanism of migraine is not known. However, there is a belief that the disease is caused by neurovascular disorders. The main theory is that there is a relationship with increased cerebral cortex arousal and abnormal control of pain nerve cells in the trigeminal nucleus of the brainstem. The recommended basic management is simple analgesics such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen for headaches, antiemetics for nausea, and avoidance of migraine triggers.",

More than 10% of the world's population suffer from migraines at some point in their lives. Migraines usually occur with severe and recurring headaches that prevent a person from carrying out normal activities, which are associated with autonomic symptoms. Approximately 15-30% of migraine patients have migraine with aura and patients who have migraine with aura also often have migraine without aura. The degree of pain, the duration of the headache, and the frequency of attacks vary. Migraines that last for more than 72 hours are called status migraineosus. There are four possible phases before the appearance of a migraine: Prodromal or precursor symptoms of migraine in ~60% of patients which begin two hours or two days before the onset of pain or aura symptoms These symptoms can present in a variety of phenomena including: mood, irritability, depression or euphoria, weakness, craving for certain foods, stiff muscles (especially in the neck), constipation/constipation or diarrhea, and increased sensitivity to smells or loud noises. These symptoms can appear in migraines with or without aura. Aura is a focal neurological phenomenon that appears before or during a headache. These symptoms last for more than a few minutes and usually last less than 60 minutes. The symptoms can be visual, sensory or motor and most patients experience more than one. The visual effect is most common and occurs in more than 99% of cases and specifically in more than half of the cases.

Sensory aura is the second most common appearance in 30-40% of patients who experience aura. Often accompanied by a prickling feeling that starts in one hand and arm and then spreads to the nose-mouth area on the same side. Numbness usually occurs after the tingling has ended along with loss of position sense. Other symptoms of the aura phase include speech or language disturbances, a feeling of spinning and, less commonly, motor disturbances. Motor symptoms indicate that the migraine that occurs is of the hemiplegic type, the feeling of weakness usually lasts more than one hour unlike other auras. Auras rarely occur without a headache, known as a silent migraine. Simply put, these headaches are unilateral, throbbing, and range from mild to severe in intensity. Usually the pain occurs gradually and gets worse with increasing physical activity. However, in more than 40% of cases, the headaches that occur are bilateral, usually accompanied by neck pain. Bilateral headaches are only common in migraine patients without aura. Sometimes, the pain is especially felt in the back and top of the head. In adults, the pain usually lasts from 4 to 72 hours while in children, it often lasts less than 1 hour.

In basilar migraine, migraine with neurological symptoms related to the brainstem or with neurological symptoms on both sides of the body, the usual effects include: a spinning sensation, lightheadedness, and confusion. Nausea occurs in almost 90% of patients, and vomiting occurs in a third. Therefore most patients want to be in a dark and quiet room. Other symptoms that may accompany it: blurred vision, stuffy nose, diarrhea, frequent urination, paleness, or sweating. Swollen or tender scalp can also occur, as can neck stiffness. General symptoms are less common in elderly patients. Migraine effects may last for several days after the core headache ends; this effect is called a posdromal migraine. Many patients report pain in the migraine affected area, some patients also report not being able to think normally for several days after the headache ends. Patients may experience fatigue or \"hung over\" and headaches, cognitive impairment, gastrointestinal symptoms, mood swings, and weakness.

There are rarely single gene disorders that cause migraines. One result of this disorder is known as familial hemiplegic migraine, a type of migraine with aura, which is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. These disorders are associated with variants of the gene coding for a protein involved in ion transport. Other genetic disorders that cause migraines are CADASIL syndrome or Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with subcortical infarction and leukoencephalopathy. Migraines are caused by a trigger, some patients report having an effect in a few cases while the majority are caused by other factors. Many things have been cited as triggers, but the strength and significance of the relationship is still uncertain. Triggers can appear up to 24 hours before symptoms start. Commonly cited triggers include stress, hunger, and fatigue (these things do contribute to tension headaches). Migraines are more common during menstruation. Other hormonal influences, including menarche, use of oral contraceptives, pregnancy, perimenopause, and menopause, also play a role. These hormonal influences appear to play a greater role in migraine without aura. Migraines usually don't occur during the second and third trimesters or during menopause after that.

Migraine is believed to be a neurovascular disorder based on supporting evidence using a mechanism that starts in the brain and then spreads into the blood vessels. Some researchers think that neuronal mechanisms play a larger role, but others think that blood vessels play a key role. Others feel both are likely important. High levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin, also known as 5-hydroxytryptamine, are also believed to play a role. Diffuse cortical depression or Le\u00e3o diffuse depression is a burst of neuronal activity followed by a period of inactivity that is seen in migraine patients with aura. There are many explanations for this depression, including activation of NMDA receptors that cause calcium to enter cells. After a burst of activity, blood is pumped into the cerebral cortex in the affected area and then decreases within two to six hours. It is believed that when depolarization flows down the brain, the pain-sensing nerves in the head and neck are triggered. The exact mechanism of the headaches that occur during migraines is unknown. Some evidence supports a major role for central nervous system structures (such as the brainstem and diencephalon) while other data support a role for peripheral activation (eg via sensory nerves enveloping the vessels of the head and neck).

Patients who experience four of the following five symptoms: throbbing headache, lasting 4\u201372 hours, pain on one side of the head, nausea, or symptoms that interfere with the person's activities of life, then the probability of a diagnosis of migraine is 92% . Patients who experience less than three of these symptoms only have a 17% chance. Migraine was first comprehensively classified in 1988. The International Headache Society created an up-to-date classification of headaches in 2004. Based on this classification, migraine is a primary headache accompanied by, among other things, tension-type headaches and cluster headaches. . Migraine is divided into seven subclasses (some of which are still divided into more subdivisions): The diagnosis of abdominal migraine is highly controversial. Some evidence suggests that recurrent abdominal pain over a period of time without a headache is also a type of migraine. Or at least a precursor of migraines.

Pressure headaches usually appear on both sides, don't throb, and are less disabling. Migraine prevention treatments include: medication, nutritional supplements, lifestyle changes, and surgery. Prevention is recommended for those who experience headaches more than two days a week, cannot tolerate medication to relieve an acute attack, or have severe attacks that are difficult to control. The goal is to reduce the frequency, pain, and/or duration of migraines, as well as to increase the effectiveness of failed therapies. Another reason for prevention is to avoid overuse headaches. This condition is a common problem that can cause chronic daily headaches. Drugs to prevent migraines are considered effective if they can reduce the frequency or severity of migraine attacks by at least 50%. Guidelines fairly consistently rank topiramate, divalproex/sodium valproate, propranolol, and metoprolol as having the highest level of evidence.

Medical devices, such as biofeedback and neurostimulators, have many advantages in preventing migraines, especially when various anti-migraine drugs are contraindicated or in conditions of overuse.

Neurostimulation using a neurostimulator in the form of an implant such as a pacemaker to treat chronic migraines that are difficult to cure gives satisfactory results in severe cases. Migraine surgery, which involves decompression of certain nerves around the head and neck, is also an option for certain people who don't improve after treatment. There are three important aspects of treatment: avoidance of triggers, control of acute symptoms, and pharmacological prevention. Treatment is more effective when used in the early stages of an attack. Frequent drug use can lead to medication overuse headaches, a condition in which the headaches become worse and more frequent. This can occur with the use of triptans, ergotamines, and analgesics, especially narcotic analgesics.

Trepanation is believed to work by \"breeding evil spirits out\". William Harvey recommended trepanation as a treatment for migraines in the 17th century. After many migraine treatment methods were tried, in 1868 found the use of a substance that finally proved effective. This substance was an ergot from which ergotamine was isolated in 1918. Metisergides were developed in 1959 and the first triptan, sumatriptan, was developed in 1988. In the 20th century with better research designs, effective preventive methods could be found and confirmed. Migraines are a significant source of both medical costs and lost productivity. It is estimated that migraine is the most expensive neurological disorder in the European Union, costing more than 27 billion Euros per year. In the United States, the direct costs associated with migraines are estimated at 17 billion USD. Nearly one-tenth of this fee is for triptans. Indirect costs due to migraines are around 15 billion USD, of which abandoned work is the largest component. Among those who attended their jobs with migraines, job effectiveness decreased by about a third. Negative impacts also often occur in the patient's family. Calcitonin gene linked peptide (CGRP) was found to play a role in the pathogenesis of migraine-associated pain. CGRP receptor antagonists, such as olcepepant and telcagepant, have been studied in both in vitro and in clinical studies for the treatment of migraine.",

In many cultures, black is often associated as a bad thing. For example, the term black magic or dark eyes. However, there were also positive effects from using black, such as showing firmness. Black is also strong so it is not easily soiled by other colors. The light that hits the black plane tends to be absorbed to the maximum. Black is the predominant color but can also mean darkness. Black is the standard for writing letters on white paper. Because of this, black ink is often sold separately by printer manufacturers, because it runs out more often than other colors. Black is also used to increase color value in the CMYK process color system. The addition of black is done according to the desired percentage. In fine arts, black is often used in the presentation of works, bearing in mind that black which is paired with other colors can strengthen the impression of that color. In addition, black is often used as a paint for rooms that cannot reflect light at all, for example, in a photographic darkroom or cinema. Black is traditionally a negative color, especially in the West. Black is usually associated with evil, death, sorrow, witchcraft, Satanism, misfortune, etc. In Japanese culture, black represents the night, the unknown, the supernatural and death.

Intercourse may be preceded by fondling which causes arousal in the partner, causes the penis to experience an erection, and natural lubrication of the vagina. To initiate intercourse, the erect penis is inserted into the vagina and one partner or both partners move their thighs to make the penis move back and forth in the vagina and produce friction, without fully extending the penis. Thus, they stimulate themselves and their partners until orgasm and ejaculation are obtained. Penile penetration is also known as \"intromission\" or by the Latin name \"immissio penis\". The term \"penetration\" is used to describe the condition when the male genitalia is inserted into the vagina. This is not always a mandatory ritual to achieve pleasure and enjoyment in sex. Sexual activity without penetration is usually carried out by teenagers by masturbating so that sperm is released. Copulation is the basic method of human reproduction. During ejaculation, which is commonly accompanied by orgasm in men, a series of muscle contractions occur which send semen containing the male gametes known as sperm cells or spermatozoa into the vaginal space.",

Mineralogy is a part of geology that specifically studies minerals. Mineralogy is also part of the earth sciences. The scientific scope in mineralogy includes physical, chemical, optical and mechanical properties of minerals. Mineralogy can be divided into two scientific branches, namely physical mineralogy and optical mineralogy. Physical mineralogy specifically deals with the arrangement of crystals in minerals. In the science of physical mineralogy. The main study is mineral crystallography. The study of mineral crystallography is based on an understanding of elemental chemistry, stoichiometry, geometry and vectors. The primacy of mineral crystallography in physical mineralogy is caused by the condition of each mineral which is crystalline. Because of this, minerals have crystalline properties that can be described and projected. This depiction and projection is done in the form of a graphic presentation. This presentation enforces the laws of the crystallization mechanism. Soil mineralogy discusses solid minerals in the form of crystals with boundaries in the form of flat planes. Certain minerals have certain flat plane features. The main discussion in soil mineralogy is rock. Meanwhile, soil organic matter is not discussed in soil mineralogy. The formation of metamorphic rocks is the result of crystallization within the Earth's crust. These metamorphic rocks range between 3\u201320 kilometers below the Earth's surface. Most of the formation of metamorphic rocks do not go through a liquid phase and immediately become solid.

The main factor is the change in physical and chemical conditions in the Earth's crust. This process of metamorphism does not involve weathering and diagenesis. The minerals contained in metamorphic rocks can originate from the original rock or result from metamorphism. Minerals due to metamorphism can be divided into three types. First, the common minerals in igneous and metamorphic rocks include biotite, hornblende, pyroxene, olivine and iron ore. Second, common minerals in sedimentary and metamorphic rocks include quartz, muscovite, clay minerals, calcite and dolomite. Third, minerals that only exist in metamorphic rocks include garnet, andalusite, cyanite, sillimanite, staautolite, cordierite, epidote and chlorite. Clay minerals at the beginning of the development of mineralogy are defined as minerals with fine textured grains. The grain diameter is smaller than 2 \u03bcm. Observations of its structure can no longer be done using an ordinary microscope. In its development, clay minerals are no longer interpreted based on the diameter of the grains, but on the shape of the layers which are like a pile of paper. The definition of clay minerals then turns into minerals that have a layered structure with an aluminosilika structure as a constituent of the framework. Grain mineralogy analysis is an analysis that aims to determine the mineral composition or mineral content in a grain-shaped mineral. The grain mineraological analysis process uses samples in the form of sand grains, sediment deposits, soil and rocks that have previously undergone preparation. The preparation process is carried out by panning method until it becomes concentrate. A binocular microscope is used as a tool for making observations. Another method that can be used is the X-ray fluorescence method. This method is widely used in mineralogy and other scientific fields.",

In addition, the results of his observations are also more accurate and less destructive. Mineralogy, especially physical mineralogy, is an early part of studying geology. Understanding mineralogy facilitates understanding of petrology. The learning outcomes from petrology serve as basic knowledge in studying geology, particularly related to the identification of geological conditions, processes and evolution. This geological knowledge can be applied to both the surface and the subsurface of the Earth. In a processing plant, knowledge of the mineralogy of a mineral is very important. This is because a mineral, especially in the form of ore, does not have standard procedures in terms of processing and refining it into metal. This level of importance is even more important in complex ores, because these ore types contain more than one type of metallic mineral. Initially, mineralogy focused more on the classification system of rock-forming minerals. Advances in experimental techniques (such as neutron defraction) and computational capabilities have made it possible to simulate the behavior of crystals on the atomic scale with great accuracy, this science has expanded to include more general problems in inorganic chemistry and solid physics. Despite this, the field continues to focus on the crystal structures commonly found in rock-forming minerals (such as perovskites, clay minerals and silicate skeletons). In particular, this field has achieved advances regarding the relationship between mineral structure and its uses in nature, a notable example being the accurate calculations and predictions of the elastic properties of minerals, which has opened up deep knowledge of the seismic behavior of rocks and depth-related unconformities on seismiograms of the Earth's mantle. . Thus, in terms of the relationship between atomic-scale phenomena and macro-characteristics, mineralogy (as is generally known today) is probably more related to materials science than any other science.

The term communism is often confused with International Communism. Communism or Marxism is the basic ideology commonly used by communist parties around the world. Meanwhile, international communism is an ideological blend originating from Lenin's thoughts, so it can also be called \"Marxism\u2013Leninism\". In communism, social change must start from taking over the means of production through the role of the communist party. In summary, the logic is that social change begins with the workers, or better known as the proletariat (see: The Holy Family), but the organization of workers can only succeed through party struggle. The party needs the role of the Politburo as a think-tank. It can be summarized that social change can only be successful if it is initiated by the Politburo. Communism as anti-capitalism uses the communist party system as a means of taking over power and strongly opposes the ownership of accumulated capital in individuals. In principle, everything is represented as belonging to the people and therefore, all means of production must be controlled by the state for the people's prosperity evenly. Communism introduces the use of a representative democratic system carried out by communist party elites. Therefore it greatly limits direct democracy to people who are not members of the communist party. Therefore, in communism, individual rights are not recognized as found in liberalism.

Arjuna rushed to get his weapon, but the weapon was kept in a room where Yudistira and Draupadi were enjoying their night. For the sake of his obligation, Arjuna is willing to enter the room to take weapons, regardless of Yudistira and Draupadi who are making out in the room. For these actions, Arjuna was sentenced to undergo exile for one year. Arjuna spent his exile exploring the corners of Bharatawarsha or the mainland of Ancient India. When he reached the Ganges, Arjuna met Ulupi, the daughter of Naga Korawya from the dragon palace or Nagaloka. Arjuna was captivated by Ulupi's beauty and married her. From the results of his marriage, he was blessed with a son named Irawan. After that, he continued his journey to the Himalayan region. After visiting the sacred rivers that were there, he turned south. He reached a land called Manipura. The king of that country was named Citrasena. He had a very beautiful daughter named Citr\u0101nggad\u0101. Arjuna fell in love with the princess and wanted to marry her, but Citrasena put forward a condition that if her daughter gave birth to a son, then her daughter must be the successor to the throne of Manipura because Citrasena did not have a son.",

After leaving Manipura, he continued his journey to the south. He reached the ocean flanking Bharatawarsha to the south, after which he turned north. He walked along the western coast of Bharatawarsha. In his wanderings, Arjuna arrived at Prabasa beach (Prabasatirta) located near Dwaraka, which is now known as Gujarat. There he disguised himself as a recluse to approach Krishna's younger brother, Subadra, unnoticed by anyone. With the attention of Baladewa, Arjuna got a proper resting place in the Subadra park. Although the plan to let the two young men live together was opposed by Krishna, Baladewa assured that bad events would not happen. Arjuna stayed for several months in Dwaraka, and Subadra had served all his needs during that time. When the right time comes, Arjuna expresses his love for Subadra. This statement was welcomed by Subadra. With the train that had been prepared by Krishna, they went to Indraprastha to have a wedding. Baladewa was angry when he heard the news that Subhadra had run away with Arjuna. Krishna assured that Subadra left of his own volition, and Subadra himself drove the train to Indraprastha, not Arjuna. Krishna also reminded Baladewa that he had previously refused to allow the two couples to live together, but this proposal was opposed by Baladewa. After Baladewa came to his senses, he made the decision to organize a lavish wedding ceremony for Arjuna and Subhadra at Indraprastha.",

The story begins with the adventures of Arjuna and Krishna on the banks of the Yamuna river. At the edge of the forest is a dense forest called Kandawa. There they met Agni, the god of fire. Agni said that kandawa forest should have been destroyed by fire, but Indra always rained it down to protect his friend Taksaka, who lived in the forest. So, Agni begged Krishna and Arjuna to help him destroy the Kandawa forest. Krishna and Arjuna agreed to help Agni, but first they requested that Agni provide both of them with powerful weapons to ward off any disturbance that would arise. Then Agni called Baruna, the god of the ocean. Baruna gave a sacred bow named Gandiwa, a chariot with four horses decorated with a flag with the monkey symbol, as well as a tube filled with an unlimited number of arrows to Arjuna. For Kresna, Baruna gave Cakra Sudarsana. With these weapons, they both kept Agni able to sleep in the Kandawa forest until it was exhausted. In the process of burning the Kandawa forest, Arjuna rescues an asura who is adept at designing buildings, his name is Mayasura. In return for the favor, Mayasura promised that he would build a palace for Yudistira, Arjuna's brother. Because Mayasura was a skilled architect, it was easy for him to build a grand hall as well as a magnificent palace for the Pandavas in Indraprastha.

The dejected angels returned to heaven, and reported their failure to Indra. Indra came down to Arjuna's ascetic place disguised as a priest.

Arjuna apologized because he had dared to do the challenge. Shiva was not angry with Arjuna, on the contrary he was amazed.

At the beginning of the battle, Arjuna is still overshadowed by Bisma's affections so he is still reluctant to kill her. This angered Krishna repeatedly, and Arjuna promised that one day he would kill Bisma. In the battle on the tenth day, Arjuna succeeded in killing Bisma, and this effort was carried out with the help of Srikandi. After Arjuna's son Abhimanyu died on the thirteenth day, Arjuna fought with Jayadratha to take revenge for his son's death.

Contemporary religious practice of satanism began with the founding of the atheist Church of Satan in the United States in 1966, although there are several historical precedents. Prior to public practice, Satanism existed in the accusations of various Christian groups against perceived ideological opponents rather than self-identity. Satanism, and the concept of the devil, have also been used by artists and entertainers for symbolic expression. Accusations that various groups have practiced satanism have been made throughout most of Christian history. During the Middle Ages, the inherent inquisition of the Catholic Church alleged that various heretical Christian sects and groups, such as the Knights Temple and the Cathars, performed secret satanic rituals. In the following Early Modern period, widespread belief in satanic witch conspiracies resulted in mass trials of alleged witches throughout Europe and the North American colonies. The accusation that a satanic conspiracy was active, and behind events such as the Protestant (and conversely, the Protestant claim that the Pope is the Antichrist) and the French Revolution continued to be perpetrated in Christendom during the eighteenth through the twentieth centuries. The idea of \u200b\u200ba widespread satanic conspiracy reached new heights with the influential Taxil hoax in France in the 1890s, which claimed that Freemasonry worshiped Satan, Lucifer, and Baphomet in their rituals. In the 1980s and 1990s, satanic ritual abuse hysteria spread across the United States and Britain, amid fears that satanic groups regularly sexually abused and killed children in their rituals.

The Satanic groups that emerged after the 1960s varied greatly, but the two main trends are theistic satanism and atheistic satanism. Theistic Satanists venerate Satan as a supernatural god, and see him not as omnipotent but as a patriarch. Atheist Satanists, on the other hand, consider Satan to be a symbol of certain human nature. Contemporary religious Satanism is largely an American phenomenon, ideas spreading elsewhere with the effects of globalization and the Internet. The internet spreads awareness of other cults, and is also a major battleground for cults' strife. Satanism began to reach Central and Eastern Europe in the 1990s, with the fall of the Soviet Union, and most notably in Poland and Lithuania, predominantly Roman Catholic countries. Satanists, that is, followers of the teachings of Satanism, have existed and carried out their activities at every stage of history and in every civilization, from ancient Egypt to ancient Greece, and from the Middle Ages to the present day. Between the 14th and 16th centuries, sorcerers and those who rejected religion both worshiped the devil. After the 1880s, in France, England, Germany, and simultaneously in various other countries in Europe and America, satanism was organized in associations and spread among people seeking other faiths and religions. Satanic worship continued into the 19th century, first as traditional Satanism, then in the smaller cults that it splintered from. Cruel ceremonies performed by sorcerers and godless people, child and adult sacrifice to satan, Black Mass celebrations and other traditional Satanic ceremonies have been passed down secretly from generation to generation.",

Historians tracing the origins of this goat-headed figure have uncovered several important clues to Satanic activity. The second most important satanic symbol is the pentagram, which is a five-pointed star inside a circle. There are two other secret societies besides the Satanists that use the Baphomet and the pentagram as symbols. The first was the Knights Templars of Jerusalem, an association accused by the Catholic Church of being a devil worshiper, which was disbanded in 1311. The other is the Masonic society, which has aroused curiosity over the years because of its secrecy and strange ceremonies. Many historians, who have investigated the matter, believe that there is a connection between the Knights of Jerusalem Monastery and Masonic societies. According to them, the two groups continued each other. After the Knights of Jerusalem Monastery banned by the Church, the association continued its existence in secret and eventually turned into Masonry. What is certain about Freemasonry is an association which is highly confidential, has an organizational structure, with members in all corners of the world. Accounts given by experts such as Leo Taxil, who was once a Mason but has left the society, say that Masons revere Baphomet very much and perform ceremonies that resemble those of Satanic worship. Another fact that raises suspicion is that many followers of Satanism later become members of Masonic organizations or Free Masons.

Satan is a term for creatures that try to destroy human life. Satan can take the form of jinn and humans. They work tirelessly day and night to mislead people from God's way so that mankind becomes their followers, so that they become their companions to live in hell later.

Atheistic flow (Atheist) is a belief system that does not recognize the existence of God or Gods to be worshipped. Satanists do not even believe in the existence of Satan as a real being. Even though they are called devil worshipers, they do not recognize the existence of satan. For satanists, Satan is only a symbol expressing hostility to their religion and hard-hearted principles. One of the famous streams of Atheistic Satanism is the Church of Satan (the Church of Satan) which was founded by Anton Szandor LaVey (Anton LaVey), and because of its name this sect is called the LaVeyan sect.

Satanists do not believe in God, angels, heaven or hell, the devil, devils, evil spirits, good spirits, fairies or other supernatural beings. Satanism is atheistic and Autodeist: \u201cWe worship ourselves. ...Satanism is materialist ... satanism is the opposite of religion\u201d. (Vexen Crabtree \u201cA Description of Satanism\u201d). So in essence, Satanism is the thoughts and beliefs of material philosophy. In the book Satanism: The Feared Religion (religion that is feared), which is published by the church of Satan, the meaning of Satan for adherents of Satanism is \"Satan is a symbol of man who lives as guided by his arrogance and physical nature\" (Peter H Gilmore, Satanism: The Feared Religion , Marrimac book, 1992). As for the expression of human physical nature, it actually describes the essence of Satanism. Satanists believe that humans are basically wild animals. This principle of belief is emphasized in various satanic texts. For example, the church of Satan often uses the term \"bodily animal\" to describe humans. This point of view lies at the basis of satanic tendencies to vicious behavior. For example, Satanists consider attacks, bloodshed, rape to be true. Because for them this is the natural behavior of wild animals. For Satanists, a human being is a beast living according to his desires. Which was the thing he had to do. The document entitled \u201cA Description of Satanism\u201d, published by the church of Satan, has this to say: \u201cAll humans and animals come from the same source in pure biology. Satanism is the belief that humans are nothing more than higher animals: we have no special place in creation, other than having been lucky to have evolved and survived\u201d (Vexen Crabtree, \u201cA Description of Satanism\u201d).",

Aleister Crowley is a pioneer of modern satanism, who has the nickname \"The Beast\". Aleister was born in Worwickshire. Since childhood he left school and became a member of the \"Secret Order of The Golden Dawn\". Crowley had been trying to contact Satan since 1898, when he was a member of the Order of the Golden Dawn. Then in 1900, Crowley associated with the British elite society, while spreading his knowledge of devil worship, to Masonic political leaders, aristocrats and royalty. Crowley was a true Occultist, and he had no other occupation. He was very interested in the ideology of satanism and Freemasonry. In his book entitled \"Confession\", he admits to being a member of the Freemasons at the Anglo Saxon Loji, Paris. He also added how he became the master of London's oldest and most respected lodge. Loji Studholme (1591), of which Tony Blair (former prime minister of England) was reported as a current member. Crowley, along with Albert Pike, had a great passion for satanic ideology. In his book \u201cWitchcraft\u201d, Crowley wrote: \u201cThe Devil is this snake, Satan, he lives and is loved, he is light and his zodiac sign is Capricorn, goat hopping, goat head\u201d.

Horus ...\u201d\" At that time, before the issue on aliens (extraterrestrials) and UFOs, and on the shape and form of aliens, Crowley has drawn sketches of the creatures that have contacted him. Her name is \"Lam\" messenger of Horus. Where Lam gave instructions to Crowley to sit at the table for three days straight. When Crowley did, his body was taken over and his hands began to write automatically, messages from the devil. Then these writings became a book entitled \"The Book Of The Law\" (Book of Law) in 1904. \"\"The new era of Horus will soon begin, but before that the earth must be bathed in blood\" \"let my servants be few and hidden, they will rule over the crowd and the visible\u201d (Lam, horus messenger). This book lays down simple laws of conduct, namely: \u201cDo whatever you will\u201d will become the whole law. \u201cLove is law..

Crowley even claimed that the formation of the O.T.O was to rebuild free masonry, to its German illuminati roots. Crowley really wanted to join the Devil. That misleading knowledge, was directly given by Satan to Crowley, which was then continued and spread by his followers, to mislead humanity. As described above, that Crowley's teaching is \"Do whatever you want!!\". This ideology is so that satan can destroy the order of religious rules, so that humans are truly astray without rules. The goal is to dominate humans and become leaders who lead people astray. Crowley taught, that a person can become a genius in music, if they want to preach and propagate the teachings of Satanism. Many musicians and rock stars became famous, after preaching the teachings of Satanism by Aleister Crowley. One of them is Ozzy Osbourne, he spread the teachings of Crowley (Satanism) through songs and music to young people. Even Osbourne made a song called \"Mr. Crowley\", because he really admired it. In the next chapter, we will discuss their actions in the world of the music industry. As for the other big plan, as part of Satan's plan to lead people astray through Crowley is to bring about a drug revolution, opening the door for society to lead him to evil spirits.

The capital city is Kuala Lumpur, while Putrajaya is the seat of the federal government. The population of this country reached 32,730,000 in 2020. The country is separated into two regions \u2014 Peninsular Malaysia and East Malaysia \u2014 by the Natuna Islands, an Indonesian territory in the Natuna Sea which lies to the south of the South China Sea. Malaysia is bordered by Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, Brunei and the Philippines. This country is located near the equator and has a tropical climate. Malaysia's head of state is a king or a sultan who is elected in turn every 5 years from among the kings of the states he governs. The King of Malaysia usually uses the title Sri Paduka Baginda Yang di-Pertuan Agong and his government is headed by a Prime Minister. Malaysia's governance model is similar to Westminster's parliamentary system. Malaysia did not exist as a federal state until 1963. Prior to this, a series of colonies were founded by the United Kingdom in the late 18th century, and the western part of modern Malaysia consisted of several separate kingdoms. The group of colonies was known as British Malaya until its dissolution in 1946, when it was reconstituted as the Union of Malaya. As opposition grew, the group was reconstituted again as the Federation of Malaya in 1948 and subsequently achieved independence on 31 August 1957. On 16 September 1963, in accordance with United Nations General Assembly Resolution 1514, in the process of decolonization, Singapore, Sarawak, Borneo North or what is now better known as Sabah turned into a state of a newly formed federation called Malaysia including the Federation of Malaya.",

Rapid growth in the 1980s and 1990s, averaging 8% from 1991 to 1997, has turned Malaysia into a newly industrialized country. International trade plays an important role in its economy because Malaysia is one of the three countries that control the Malacca Strait. At one time, Malaysia was the world's largest producer of tin, rubber and palm oil. The manufacturing industry has a major influence on the economy of this country. Malaysia is also considered as one of the 18 most biodiverse countries in the world. Malays make up the largest part of the Malaysian population. There are also sizable ethnic (\"race\") Chinese Malaysians and Malaysian Indians. Malay and Islam are the official state languages \u200b\u200band religions respectively.

Going even further back, a British ethnologist, George Samuel Windsor Earl, in volume IV of the Journal of the Indian Archipelago and East Asia in 1850 proposed to name the Indonesian archipelago as Melayunesia or Indunesia, although he preferred the latter. Archaeological remains were found all over the country. The Semang people have deep ancestry in the Malay Peninsula, dating back to the first settlements in Africa, more than 50,000 years ago. The Senoi also exist, as a mixed group; almost part of their genealogy comes from the Semang line of ancestors and partly from Indochina.

The arrival of Chola succeeded in dampening the majesty of Sriwijaya, which gave great influence to Kedah and Pattani and even reached Ligor. The Buddhist government of Ligor immediately returned to control Kedah. Its king, Chandrabhanu, used this place as a base to invade Sri Lanka in the 11th century, an event carved on stone inscriptions at Nagapattinum in Tamil Nadu and in the Sri Lankan epic, the Mahavamsa.

To avoid persecution, Parameswara sailed to Temasek to get the protection of Temagi, a Malay prince from Pattani who was appointed by the King of Siam as regent of Temasek. A few days later, Parameswara killed Temagi and appointed himself regent. About five years later, he left Temasek due to threats from Siam. During this period, Temasek was also attacked by a Javanese fleet from Majapahit. He later headed north to found a new settlement.

In 1826, Britain established Crown Colonies in the Straits Settlements, consolidating its possessions in Malaya: Penang, Malacca, Singapore, and the island of Labuan. Penang was established in 1786 by Captain Francis Light as a commercial post awarded by the Sultan of Kedah. The Straits Settlements were initially managed under the British East India Company in Calcutta, before Penang, and then Singapore became the crown colony management center, until 1867, when management responsibility was transferred to the Colonial Office in London. During the 19th century, many Malay states tried to get British help to resolve their internal conflicts.

Over a long time, Malaya became the world's largest producer of tin, rubber and palm oil. These three commodities, along with other raw materials, set the better tempo for Malaysia's economy well into the 20th century. Instead of relying on the ethnic Malays as a source of labour, the British brought in Chinese and Indians to work in the mines, plantations and to fill the professional skills gap. Although many of them returned to their home countries after the contracts were fulfilled, some of them stayed in Malaysia. As Malaya moved toward independence, the government began implementing five-year economic planning, starting with the First Malaya Five Year Plan in 1955. When Malaysia was founded, the planning terms were replaced and numbered, starting with the First Malaysia Plan in 1965. In the 1970s, Malaysia began emulate the economies of the Four Asian Tigers (Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore) and commit to a transformation from an economy dependent on mining and agriculture to one based on manufacturing. With Japanese investment, heavy industries began to open up and a few years later, Malaysian exports became the country's primary growth engine. Malaysia consistently received more than 7% GDP growth accompanied by low inflation in the 1980s and 1990s. Basically, Malaysia's growth depends on the export of electronic materials such as computer chips and so on. As a result, Malaysia felt intense pressure during the economic crisis in 1998 and the slump in the information technology sector in 2001. KDNK in 2001 only increased by 0.3% due to an 11% reduction in export figures but a large package of fiscal incentives mitigated the impact .",

Its main objective was to remove the link between race and economic functioning, and the first five-year plan began to implement NEP as the Second Malaysia Plan. The success or failure of the NEP is a matter of debate, although it officially ended in 1990 and was replaced by the National Development Policy (NDP). Recently much debate has emerged about the outcome and relevance of the NEP. Some argue that the NEP has clearly succeeded in creating upper-middle class Malay entrepreneurs and professionals. Despite some improvements in the general economic strength of the Malays, the Malaysian government maintains a policy of discrimination favoring the Malays over other ethnic groups - including prioritizing employment, education, scholarships, trade, access to cheap housing and assisted savings. This special treatment fuels jealousy and hatred among non-Malays and Malays. Chinese domination of the state's economic sector that is owned by local parties has been largely surrendered to benefit Bumiputra/Malays in many strategic/important industries such as the distribution of petroleum derivatives, transportation, agriculture, and others. Most of the professionals per capita are still predominantly Indian-Malaysians. The rapid economic boom led to all sorts of supply problems. The meager workforce was soon filled with a steady stream of millions of immigrant workers, many of whom were illegal. Cash-capital-rich PLC and a consortium of banks immediately benefited from the expansion and accelerated start-up of large infrastructure projects. This ended when the 1997 Asian financial crisis hit in the fall of 1997, delivering a major shock to the Malaysian economy. Like other countries affected by the crisis, there was a speculative short selling of Malaysia's currency, the ringgit. Foreign investment fell to dangerous levels, as capital evaporated out of the country, the value of the ringgit fell from MYR 2.50 per USD to MYR 4.80 per USD.",

After the controversial arrest of finance minister Anwar Ibrahim, a National Economic Action Council was formed to anticipate the monetary crisis. Bank Negara Malaysia maintains capital controls and pegs the Malaysian ringgit exchange rate at 3.80 to the US dollar. However, Malaysia rejected economic aid packages from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, moves that surprised foreign analysts. In March, 2005, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) published a paper on Malaysia's resources and recovery measures, written by Jomo K.S. from the department of applied economics, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur. The paper concludes that the controls imposed by the Malaysian government have neither exacerbated nor aided recovery. The biggest factor was the increasing number of electronic component exports, which was caused by the increasing demand for components in the United States, which was caused by fears of the impact of the arrival of the year 2000 (Y2K) on older computers and other digital devices. However, post-Y2K waning in 2001 did not affect Malaysia as much as many other countries. This provides clearer evidence that there are other causes and effects that may be more appropriate for recovery. One possibility is that currency speculators went bankrupt financially after falling in their attack on the Hong Kong dollar in August 1998 and after the Russian ruble collapsed. (See George Soros) Regardless of cause and effect claims, economic rejuvenation also rolled on with massive budget deficits and government spending in the years following the crisis. Then, Malaysia enjoyed a faster economic recovery compared to its neighbors. However, in many ways the country has not recovered to pre-crisis levels.",

The current account is in structural surplus, providing a cushion for capital flotation. Current asset prices, a fraction of their pre-crisis highs. Malaysia has a number of stable macroeconomic elements (where inflation and unemployment rates remain below 3%), healthy foreign exchange reserves, and low external debt. This enabled Malaysia not to experience the same crisis as the Asian financial crisis in 1997. However, the long-term prospects are not looking good due to the lack of change in the legal entity sector, especially the sector dealing with high and competitive corporate debt. The pegged exchange rate was reopened in July 2005 to a supervised floating exchange rate after an hour of China's introduction of the same. In the same week, the ringgit strengthened 1 percent against other major currencies and is expected to appreciate further. But by December 2005, hopes of further appreciation were muted as capital flows exceeded USD 10 billion. In September 2005, Howard J. Davies, director of the London School of Economics, told a meeting in Kuala Lumpur, warning Malaysian officials that if they wanted flexible capital markets to return, they would have to lift the ban on short selling.

According to Hindu teachings, the four ages form a cycle, just like the cycle of the four seasons. The cycle begins with Satyayuga, leading to Kaliyuga. After Kaliyuga ends, a new Satyayuga begins. The changing times from Satyayuga (golden age) to Kaliyuga (dark age) is the fact that the teachings of truth and awareness as religious people will gradually decrease, as humanity increases and times change. Where in the end humans will feel that in an old age, when the earth is old, when moral decay and cultural shifts have gotten worse, it is time for the end of the world. If compared to the Ox of Dharma (a symbol of the development of morality), the four cycles of Yuga (Caturyuga) are like an ox that stands on four legs, where each age changes, the ox's leg also decreases by one, a symbol of morality that decreases with each age. The Satyayuga Age is like an ox standing on four legs, morality is steady. Meanwhile, the Treta Yuga was like an ox standing on three legs. Masa Dwaparayuga with two legs, and Masa Yuga with only one leg. At that time, morality could no longer stand firm. The cycle begins with the golden age (Satyayuga) and ends with the dark age (Kaliyuga). After the dark age ends, a new golden age begins, just as winter changes to spring, and this cycle lasts for thousands of years.",

That is the cycle of time from Satyayuga to Kaliyuga, and Kaliyuga will return to Satyayuga. The period from Satyayuga to Kaliyuga is called 1 Mahayuga. After Mahayuga lasted 71 times, a period called Manvantara was reached. After 14 Manvantaras take place, a period called Kalpa is reached. According to Hindu teachings, when this period is reached, the universe is destroyed. In accordance with the character of each era, there are things that take precedence, namely: In Caturyuga, each era that takes place has a period of time. According to one traditional calculation, each era has a different period of time, and when combined, they form a period called 1 Mahayuga. Briefly explained as follows: This time period is the basis for famous calculations, as described in the Bhagawadgita book compiled by Om Visnupada A.C.B. Swami Prabhupada. According to the book, the Kali Yuga period began \u00b1 5,000 years ago (supposedly when King Yudistira ascended the throne and Kresna died, namely 3102 BC) and will continue for approximately 432,000 years. Sri Yukteswar has another calculation. According to Sri Yukteswar, in his book The Holy Science, Satyayuga lasted 4,800 years, Tretayuga lasted 3,600 years, Dwaparayuga lasted 2,400 years, and Kaliyuga lasted 1,200 years. According to Sri Yukteswar, Kaliyuga began in 499 BC, and since 1699 AD, this world has gone through the Dwaparayuga period again. The cycle referred to by Sri Yukteswar is a cycle that goes backwards, not back to the beginning.",

The study of glaciology also includes aspects of other sciences such as geophysics, geology, physical geography, geomorphology, climatology, meteorology, hydrology, biology and ecology. Glaciers are one of the natural phenomena that are extensively reviewed by glaciologists. Structural glaciology is a branch of glaciology that specifically deals with the structure of glaciers. The scope of the discussion is an understanding of the process of distribution and movement of ice debris in the glacier. The formation of the glacial structure is related to the transport of ice debris as a result of internal deformation. The study of glaciology, especially the study of ice masses, is a complex study because it requires an understanding of various processes of dynamics, thermodynamics and long-term behavior of ice sheets. On the other hand, this study was difficult to carry out because the environmental conditions were very cold and dark for a very long time. Remote sensing has provided useful results in glaciological studies, especially in the study of ice masses. Since the 1950s, radar systems have been developed as a remote sensing method for measuring ice thickness. One of the radar systems that is widely used in remote sensing in glaciology is radio echo sounding. The working principle utilizes electromagnetic waves that can penetrate the ice layer. Radio echo sounding is used to obtain information about the electromagnetic properties of different interfaces. These interfaces include ice cubes, ice water, and ice on sea water. The resulting sound echoes back into the radar.",

The delivery speed is around 0.5 nanoseconds to a few microseconds. Radio echo sounding is used to investigate the characteristics of bedrock down to the thickest permafrost zone. The maximum thickness of the ice it reaches is 4,755 meters. Prior to the 1980s, glaciology was not considered important in international policy studies on climate change. The initial study that started to tie the knot was a project called the Vostok Ice Core which had been under way since the 1970s. The study was conducted at a Soviet Union station located at a remote point in the arctic part of East Antarctica. The Soviet Union and France then collaborated on this study in the mid-1980s. Then in 1987, the two countries published the results of their collaboration regarding the relationship between stable water isotopes and greenhouse gas concentrations. These greenhouse gases include methane and carbon dioxide. The identification process is carried out in air bubbles in the ice core. The isotope ratios in the ice make it clear that there is a clear relationship between the concentration of greenhouse gases and the temperature of the air above the ice sheet. At a depth of 2 kilometers in the ice core, the signal conditions of the glacial-interglacial cycle for about 110 thousand years were recorded. The results of deep-sea sediment records have provided information that temperature signals do not only respond to changes in the geometry of the Earth's orbit. The temperature signal is also getting stronger due to the presence of greenhouse gases. This is why the United Nations launched the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 1988. This scientific panel then produces regular reports that provide summaries of the current state of knowledge about the climate system.",

        "paragraph": "page editor logged out learn more Vertigo (from Latin vert\u014d \"spinning motion\") is a form of headache in which the sufferer experiences an undue perception of movement (usually spinning or gliding) caused by a disturbance in the vestibular system. Vertigo is often accompanied by symptoms of nausea and vomiting and the inability of the sufferer to maintain body balance, which causes the sufferer to have difficulty standing or walking. Vertigo is divided into three types. The first type is known as objective where the sufferer feels the objects around him are moving. The second type is known as subjective where sufferers feel they are moving when they are still. The third type is known as pseudovertigo, in which the patient feels a spinning sensation in his head. The word vertigo comes from the Latin vertere which means to rotate (2). The definition of vertigo is: a sensation of movement or a sense of movement from the body or the surrounding environment, may be accompanied by other symptoms, especially from the autonomic network due to disturbances in the body's balance organs. accompanied by spinning or the environment feels spinning even though the person's body is not moving. This disorder occurs due to balance disorders either central or peripheral, abnormalities in the ear often cause vertigo. To determine the abnormalities that cause vertigo, ENT-KL doctors will usually perform an ENG (electronistagmography) examination. Sufferers feel as if they are moving or rotating; or the sufferer feels as if the objects around him are moving or rotating. Pathogological vertigo can be of various types. There is a temporary or persistent, functional or structural impairment of the vestibular value or visual value, or the system's proprioceptive system or from the integrative center through a mechanism also causes \"incompatibility\".",

        "paragraph": "In other words, many things must be considered before determining the diagnosis of vertigo. Evaluation of vertigo has two fundamental objectives, namely: determining the localization of its source of origin and determining its etiology/cause. Before starting treatment, the nature and cause of vertigo must be determined. Abnormal eye movements indicate an abnormal function of the inner ear or the nerves that connect it to the brain. Nystagmus is rapid eye movement from left to right or up and down. The direction of the movement can help in making the diagnosis. Nystagmus can be stimulated by moving the patient's head suddenly or by dripping cold water into the ear. To test balance, the patient is asked to stand and then walk in a straight line, first with eyes open, then with eyes closed. Hearing tests can often determine the presence of ear disorders that affect balance and hearing. Other tests are a CT scan or MRI of the head, which can show bone abnormalities or tumors pressing on nerves. If an infection is suspected, a sample of fluid from the ear or sinuses or from spine. If it is suspected that there is a decrease in blood flow to the brain, then an angiogram will be examined, to see if there is a blockage in the blood vessels leading to the brain. Vertigo is divided into several types, but in general based on the involvement of the vestibule, vertigo is divided into 2 types, namely direct/vestibular vertigo and indirect/non-vestibular vertigo. It is characterized by: a lesion in the peripheral parts of the vestibular apparatus such as: the vestibular organs or the vestibulocochlear nerve. Patients feel that the surrounding environment is spinning (oscillopsia), it feels up and down like being on a ship. Vestibular vertigo is often accompanied by autonomic symptoms such as nausea and vomiting and nystagmus. There are also vestibular lesions in the central part, for example, lesions in the vestibular nuclei in the brainstem.",

        "paragraph": "Central vestibular lesions can also cause direct vertigo, but are generally milder than peripheral lesions. Autonomic symptoms also tend to be minimal or even absent. BPV is by far the most common cause of vertigo. It results from free-floating calcium carbonate crystals that inadvertently enter the long arms of the posterior semicircular canal. Normally these crystals are attached to the utricular macula. With a change in position, the crystals move in the endolymph and displace the cupula, causing vertigo. It is a type of epidemic disease and can affect several members of the same family at once. This disease is more common in spring or early summer. These risk factors suggest that the disease is a viral infection and pathological studies reveal atrophy of one or more of the vestibular nerve trunks, which most closely corresponds to an infectious or postinfectious process. Based on pathological findings, the underlying cause of this disease is an increase in endolymph volume associated with distention of the entire endolymphatic system (endolymphatic hydrops). Rupture of the labyrinth membrane may explain the sudden characteristic of the episodes in this syndrome. Nonvestibular vertigo is often difficult for patients to describe clearly. Patients usually complain of feeling dizzy, empty in the head, and dark in the eyes. Oscillopsia and autonomic symptoms were never found. Lesions in the central nervous system can cause pathological nystagmus. Nonvestibular vertigo can be caused by lesions in the nonvestibular parts of the balance regulatory system or it can be caused by errors in information processing in the central nervous system (eg, due to cerebellar lesions). Orthostatic hypotension and aortic stenosis can be causes of nonvestibular vertigo. Migraine-induced vertigo is due to vasospasm or inherited metabolic defects.

The area that is now the Republic of Iraq was anciently called Mesopotamia, which in Greek means \"(area) between the rivers\". With long tracts of land and narrow crescent-shaped and fertile soil, this area is also called the \"Fertile Crescent\".The name Mesopotamia was used by ancient Greek and Latin writers, such as Polybius (2nd century BC) and Strabo (60 BC-20 AD) This fertile land has given rise to many glorious ancient civilizations and collectively known as the Mesopotamian civilization.It is the earliest civilization in West Asia and one of the oldest in the world.According to Christian and Jewish beliefs such as That is to say, in the Old Testament, there is an attempt to link Abraham's family (later called the \"Fathers of the Faith\" and recognized by the world's three monotheistic religions, Islam, Christianity, and Judaism) with Mesopotamia. In the book of Genesis 11:31 it is said, at one time Abraham's family moved from Ur Ka\u015bdim to Haran before finally moving to Canaan (Areas of Israel and Palestine today). The location of Ur Ka\u015bdim is usually referred to as Tell el-Muqayyar, the site of the ruins of the ancient city of Ur from the Sumerian period. Meanwhile, Haran was located in the northern part of Mesopotamia, on the banks of the Euphrates River. The regional toponymy of Mesopotamia comes from the Ancient Greek roots \u03bc\u03ad\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2 (mesos) \"middle\" and \u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03b1\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2 (potamos) \"river\" and literally means \"(land) between the rivers\".

This toponymy was used even earlier by the Greeks as evidenced by the Anabasis of Alexandria, which was written at the end of the 2nd century AD, but specifically refers to sources from the time of Alexander the Great. In the Anabasis, Mesopotamia is used to refer to the region extending east of the Euphrates River in northern Syria. The Aramaic term biritum / birit Narim is related to a similar geographic concept. Later, the term Mesopotamia was more generally applied to all the lands between the Euphrates and Tigris rivers, thus incorporating not only parts of Syria but also almost all of Iraq and southeastern Turkey. The steppe plains west of the Euphrates and the western part of the Zagros Mountains are also often included under the broader term Mesopotamia. A further distinction is usually made between upper or northern Mesopotamia and lower or southern Mesopotamia. Northern Mesopotamia also known as the Jezirah, is the area between the Euphrates and Tigris to Baghdad. Southern Mesopotamia comprises southern Iraq, Kuwait, and western Iran. In modern academic usage, the term Mesopotamia also has a chronological connotation. Often used to refer to this area up to the time of the Muslim Conquest. Names such as Syria, Jezirah, and Iraq were used to describe the region after this time. It has been argued that this euphemism is a Eurocentric term applied to this area during the encroachment of 19th century Westerners. Mesopotamia encompasses the area between the Euphrates and Tigris rivers, which both originate in the Armenian Highlands. The two rivers also receive additional water supplies from many tributaries, and the entire network of these rivers drains a vast mountainous area.",

The region's climate is semi-arid with vast expanses of desert in the north and 15,000 square kilometers (5,800 square miles) of swampy, muddy, and bubbling terrain in the south. Far to the south, the Euphrates and Tigris join and empty into the Persian Gulf. The arid environment extends from the rain-fed agricultural areas in the north to the south where irrigated agriculture is essential if one is to expect the acquisition of an energy surplus generated over the energy invested (Energy Returned On Energy Invested, EROEI). Irrigation is facilitated by high groundwater levels and melting snow from the high peaks of the Zagros Mountains in the north and from the highlands of Armenia, the source of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers for which the country is named. The benefits of irrigation depend on being able to deploy sufficient manpower to construct and maintain the canals. Thus, it is this factor that since the beginning of time has helped the growth of urban settlements and a centralized system of political power. Agriculture throughout Mesopotamia was supported by nomadic cattle herding. Nomads living in tents herded sheep and goats (and later camels) from the pastures along the rivers in the dry summer months, to the seasonal pastures along the border with the desert in the cold winter months. wet. The Mesopotamian region was generally deprived of stones for building materials, precious metals, and wood, and thus depended throughout its history on the long-distance trade in agricultural produce to obtain these scarce goods from outside the region. In the marshy areas of the south, there existed an elaborate culture of fishing with transport vessels since prehistoric times, which added to the cultural diversity of Mesopotamia.",

The need for labor has over time resulted in population increases that push the limits of ecological carrying capacity, and when the region experiences a period of climatic chaos, the collapse of the central government and population decline can occur. On the other hand, the military's vulnerability to attacks from fringe tribes from the hill regions or pastures has resulted in a collapse of commerce and the neglect of irrigation networks for a time. Likewise, the centralizing tendencies that existed in the city-states were only centralized government over all of Mesopotamia. When enforced, it tends to be short-lived, and the regional spirit is also fragmented as a whole power into smaller ethnic or regional units. This kind of tendency still continues in Iraq until now. The history of Mesopotamia begins with the growth of a civilization, which is believed to be the center of the oldest civilization in the world, by the Sumerians. The Sumerians built several famous ancient cities, namely Ur, Ereck, Kish, etc. The presence of an imperialistic figure from another nation who also inhabited the Mesopotamia region, the Akkadians, led by Sargon the Great, apparently carried out a political conquest, but not a cultural conquest. In many ways, the Sumerian and Akkadian cultures even acculturated, so that this era of leadership is often called the Sumerian-Akkadian volume. Sumerian interference cannot be underestimated, when the Akkadians were pressured by the Gutti people, the Sumerians who supported the Akkadians, so that they could still rule in the \"land between the two rivers\". Several other accounts can be put forward to show the relationship between Abraham and Mesopotamia.

Likewise with Jacob, Abraham's grandson, he was told to go to Padan-Aram to get a wife there (Genesis 28:2). In the Greek Septuagint translation, these last two names are called Mesopotamia. Apart from the explicit indications in the Bible, other information can be found which indicates a strong Mesopotamian influence. The parallels between the stories of Enkidu/Shamhat and Adam/Eve have long been recognized by researchers. The story of the Garden of Eden and the famous story of the Flood, which are told at the beginning of the book of Genesis, are actually heavily influenced by Mesopotamian literature. Usually three works of Mesopotamian literature are designated, namely the Enuma Elis (from 17th century BC), the Epic of Gilgamesh (20th century BC), and Athrahasis (18-17th century BC). These texts are quite well-known and widespread because they are found in various versions and languages, such as Akkadian, Sumerian, Hittite, and Assyrian versions. The similarities between Mesopotamian literature and Biblical texts are so striking that it is often concluded that there is a dependency between the two. Since the Mesopotamian texts date from a much older period than the Biblical texts, it is not surprising that it can be concluded that the Biblical text depended on this Mesopotamian literature. Israeli writers seem to have taken and used these Mesopotamian texts to express their beliefs, and at the same time adapted them to them, especially in the area of \u200b\u200bmonotheism. One possible Mesopotamian influence in the book of Genesis is that Mesopotamian stories were brought to Palestine and then spread during the large-scale migration of people from Mesopotamia which was caused by the somewhat chaotic situation around the 19th century BC.

This can be known through an analysis of legal texts in force at Nuzi, which date back to the 15th century BC. The story of Abraham coming to a foreign land and claiming his wife as his sister (Genesis 12:10-20) often confuses people. Now, however, with the discovery of texts belonging to the Horites in northern Mesopotamia, close to Haran, this can be understood better. In Hori society, the strongest marriage bond is when one wife simultaneously obtains sister status legally. Because of this, it often happens that after the wedding another ceremony is held to adopt the wife as a sister. This is legalized with two documents. First, documents regarding marriage. Second, related to her appointment as a sister. Matthias Henze points out that Nebuchadnezzar's madness in the Book of Daniel refers to the Epic of Gilgamesh. He claims that the author used elements from Enkidu's description to paint a sarcastic and mocking portrait of the Babylonian king. One of the most valuable legacies of the Ancient Mesopotamian civilization for mankind is a collection of laws commonly called the Codex Hammurabi. The collection of laws in the form of black stone blocks was discovered in Susa in 1901 during an expedition by French archaeologists under the leadership of M de Morgan. At the top of the beam, which is now in the Louvre Museum, Paris, there is a relief depicting King Hammurabi of Ancient Babylon (1728-1686 BC) receiving law from the god Shamash, the sun god who is also the patron god of justice.",

The dependence between the two sets of laws cannot be determined with certainty, but an indirect effect seems very plausible. The Codex Hammurabi, which consists of 282 chapters plus the Prologue and Epilogue, influences not only the body of laws contained in the Bible, but also the legal system in later periods. What's interesting and perhaps makes us (should) be ashamed is that this collection of laws also reminds us that since the 18th century BC, in Mesopotamia there has been a great leader who truly has the awareness that humans must be treated fairly as humans. The Ancient Mesopotamians held ceremonies every month. The theme of the ceremonies and celebrations for each month was determined by at least six main factors: Hunting was popular with the Assyrian kings. Boxing and wrestling are frequently featured in the fine arts, and some form of playing polo is apparently a popular sport, with players sitting on people's shoulders rather than horses. They also play majore, a game similar to rugby, but played with a wooden ball. They also played a board game similar to senet and backgammon, and which is known today as the \"Royal Game of Ur.\" Cultivation of food crops assisted by irrigation systems spread from the Zagros mountains southwards along with the Samara civilization and the Hadji Muhammed civilization from around 5,000 BC. The Sumerian temples served as banks and developed the first large-scale systems of loans and credit, but it was the Babylonians who developed the first commercial banking systems.

Ensi is the word used to refer to the person in charge of managing the work of all kinds of agricultural enterprises on the shrine grounds. Commoners were known to be the group that most often worked in agriculture as sharecroppers, especially on land belonging to temples or palaces. The geographical conditions of southern Mesopotamia only allow agriculture to be carried out if it is managed with good irrigation and drainage. This fact had a major impact on the evolution of early Mesopotamian civilization. The need for irrigation prompted the Sumerians, and later the Akkadians, to build their cities along the banks of the Tigris and Euphrates and their tributaries. Major cities, such as Ur and Uruk, were located around tributaries of the Euphrates River, while other cities, notably Lagash, were founded near tributaries of the Tigris. Rivers also have other uses as a source of supply for fish (either as food or as fertilizer), reed, and clay (for building materials). Thanks to irrigation, the food supply in Mesopotamia was comparable to that of the Canadian prairies. The Tigris and Euphrates River basins form the northeastern part of the Fertile Crescent stretch which also includes the Jordan River valley and the Nile River valley. If getting closer to the river makes the land fertile and good for planting, on the other hand the farther the distance from the river makes the land dry and most of it uninhabitable. That is why the development of irrigation was so important to the inhabitants of Mesopotamia. Other Mesopotamian innovations were controlling the flow of water with dams and the use of aqueducts.",

The inhabitants of Mesopotamia were counted among the first people to make beer and wine. The involvement of skill in farming in Mesopotamia meant that farmers did not depend on slaves to complete the work of their fields, but there were some exceptions. The high risk of employing slaves (slaves running away or rebelling) made many farmers avoid them. Although the rivers supported the life of the people of Mesopotamia, they also destroyed it with floods that often overflowed and destroyed entire cities. The unpredictable Mesopotamian weather often worked against farmers; food crops were often damaged by weather so people needed to maintain reserve food sources such as cattle and sheep. Over time, the southernmost areas of Mesopotamia suffered from the increasing salinity of the soil, resulting in the gradual abandonment of cities and the concentration of power in even more northern Akkadia. The geography of Mesopotamia greatly influenced the political developments in that region. Between the rivers and streams, the Sumerians founded the first cities with their irrigation canals separated from each other by large, open expanses of desert or swamp, where nomadic tribes roamed. Communication between isolated cities is difficult and sometimes dangerous to do. Therefore, each Sumerian city became an independent city-state and staunchly defended its independence. Occasionally one city would try to conquer and unite cities of its own territory, but such attempts were met with resistance and failed for centuries.

The Akkadian Empire was the first empire that was able to survive beyond a generation and see the peaceful succession of kings. The lifespan of this empire was relatively short, as it was conquered by the Babylonians after surviving for generations. The Mesopotamians believed that their kings and queens descended from the citizens of the City of the Gods, but unlike the Ancient Egyptians, they never believed their kings were true gods. Most of the kings called themselves \"king of the universe\" or \"great king\". Another title that is commonly used is \"shepherd\", because kings must pay attention to the lives of their people. As it grew into an empire, Assyria's territory was divided into regions called provinces. Each province was named after its main city, such as Nineveh, Samaria, Damascus, and Arpad. All provinces are headed by their respective governors whose job is to ensure that everyone pays their taxes. The governors are also obliged to raise troops to go to war and distribute labor when there is a temple construction. A governor is also responsible for enforcing laws in the province he or she presides over. This method made it easier to control a large empire. Although previously just a small country in Sumer, Babylon grew rapidly during the reign of Hammurabi. He was known as the \"creator of the rule of law,\" and soon Babylon became one of the main cities in Mesopotamia. Babylon was later called Babylonia, which means \"archway of the gods.\" The city is also one of the greatest centers of learning in history.

The Late Early Dynastic III (2600\u20132350 BC) Stele of Vultures, which commemorates Eannatum of Lagash's victory over the neighboring rival city of Umma, is the oldest monument in the world extolling an act of massacre. From that time onwards, warfare was made a part of the Mesopotamian political system. Occasionally a neutral city can act as a mediator for two cities that are fighting each other. This situation encouraged the formation of inter-city unions which later developed into regional states. When empires formed, they also went to war but more often against foreign countries. King Sargon for example, conquered all the cities in Sumer, some cities in Mari, and then went to war against northern Syria.

Surface surveys in archeology have also made it possible to make studies of the urban layout of early Mesopotamian cities.

According to Apollodorus, an ancient Greek writer, Anaximanders (610-546 BC) was 63 years old when the 58th Olympiad was held in 547/546 BC. Therefore, it is estimated that Anaximander was born around 610 BC. Then it is also stated that Anaximander died not long after the Olympics ended, so the time of his death is estimated at 546 BC. According to ancient Greek tradition, Anaximander had services in astronomy and geography. For example, Anaximander is said to be the first person to make a map of the earth. His efforts in geography can be seen when he led an expedition from Miletus to found a new overseas city to Apollonia on the Black Sea.

To apeiron comes from the Greek, which is a combination of a and peras which means without limit. It is an abstract principle which is the basic principle of everything. He is divine, eternal, irreversible, and all-pervading. It is from this principle that everything that exists in the universe as opposing elements (hot and cold, dry and wet, night and light) originates. Then to this principle all will eventually return.

The hot covers the cold so that the cold is contained within. From that cold came the liquid and frozen. What is frozen is what then becomes the earth. The flames that covered the cold were then shattered as well. The fragments swirled and then separated to form the sun, moon and stars.

An ecosystem is an amalgamation of each biosystem unit that involves reciprocal interactions between organisms and the physical environment so that the flow of energy leads to a certain biotic structure and a material cycle occurs between organisms and inorganics. The sun is the source of all existing energy. In an ecosystem, organisms in a community develop together with the physical environment as a system. Organisms will adapt to the physical environment, otherwise organisms also affect the physical environment for the purposes of life. This definition is based on the Gaia Hypothesis, namely: \"organisms, especially microorganisms, together with the physical environment produce a control system that maintains conditions on earth suitable for life\". This has led to the fact that the chemistry of the atmosphere and Earth is very controlled and very different from that of the other planets in the solar system. The presence, abundance and distribution of a species in an ecosystem is determined by the level of availability of resources and conditions of chemical and physical factors that must be within the range that can be tolerated by the species, this is what is called the law of tolerance. For example: Pandas have a wide tolerance for temperature, but has a narrow tolerance for its food, namely bamboo. Thus, pandas can live in ecosystems under any conditions as long as the ecosystem has bamboo as a food source.

The river water is cold and clear and contains little sediment and food. The water flow and waves constantly provide oxygen to the water. The water temperature varies with altitude and latitude. The river ecosystem is inhabited by animals such as cat fish, carp, turtles, snakes, crocodiles and dolphins. This ecosystem consists of corals that are near the coast. The efficiency of this ecosystem is very high. The animals that live in coral eat microscopic organisms and other organic remains. Various invertebrates, micro-organisms and fish live among corals and algae. Herbivores such as snails, sea urchins, fish, become prey for octopuses, starfish and carnivorous fish. The presence of coral reefs near the beach makes the beach has white sand. Its depth is more than 6,000 m. Usually there are sea catfish and sea fish that can emit light. As producers there are bacteria that are symbiotic with certain corals. Seagrasses or seagrasses are the only group of flowering plants that live in the marine environment. These plants live in shallow coastal waters. Like grasses on land, they have erect leafy shoots and creeping stalks that are effective for reproduction.

Injuries can be intentional or accidental and can be caused by blunt trauma, penetrating trauma, burns, poison exposure, and asphyxia. Several major medical organizations have established systems for classifying and describing injuries. Injuries can occur anywhere in the body, and different symptoms are associated with different types of injuries. Treatment of injuries is usually carried out by a healthcare professional and varies greatly depending on the nature of the injury. Traffic accidents are the most common cause of injury-related injuries and deaths. Injuries are different from chronic conditions, psychological trauma, infections, or medical procedures, although injuries can be a factor in any of these. Injury may occur intentionally or unintentionally. Intentional injury can be an act of violence against another person or towards oneself. Accidental injuries may be unexpected or may be caused by negligence. The most common types of accidental injuries are traffic accidents, falls, drowning, burns and accidental poisoning. Certain types of injuries are more common in developed or developing countries. Traffic related injuries are more likely to kill pedestrians than drivers in developing countries. Scald burns are more common in developed countries, whereas open burns are more common in developing countries. By 2021, around 4.4 million people annually worldwide will die as a result of injuries, accounting for nearly 8% of all deaths. A total of 3.16 million of these injuries are unintentional and 1.25 million of them are intentional.",

This constant state includes variables, such as body temperature and body fluid balance, which are maintained within predetermined limits (which are called homeostatic ranges). Examples of other variables are the pH of the extracellular fluid, the concentrations of sodium, potassium, and calcium ions, and blood sugar levels. These things need to be maintained even though the environment, diet, and body activities are constantly changing. Each of these variables is controlled by one or several mechanisms that together sustain life. When things are in optimal conditions, homeostasis appears as a natural resistance to change. Balanced conditions are maintained and regulated by many mechanisms. All mechanisms that control homeostasis have at least three interdependent components, namely receptors, control centers, and effectors, each of which has its own for each regulated variable. Receptors are sensing components that monitor and respond to changes in the environment, both external and internal. Receptors include temperature receptors and mechanical receptors. Control centers such as the respiratory center and the renin-angiotensin system. The effector is the target that is acted upon so that changes are returned to their normal state. The concept of regulation of the internal environment was explained by the French physiologist Claude Bernard in 1849, while the word homeostasis was coined by Walter Bradford Cannon in 1926. In 1932, Joseph Barcroft, a British physiologist, said that the higher functions of the brain require the most internal environment. stable. For Barcroft, homeostasis is not only regulated by the brain, but also serves the brain. Homeostasis is an almost exclusively biological term, which refers to the concept explained by Bernard and Cannon, regarding the constant internal environment in which the body's cells live and survive.",

        "paragraph": "The term cybernetics is applied to control systems such as thermostats, which function as mechanisms to maintain homeostasis, but are often defined much more broadly than the biological term homeostasis. The word homeostasis itself combines new Latin words from Ancient Greek: \u1f45\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 homoios, \"similar to\" and \u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 stasis, \"to remain still\", which results in the compound word \"remaining the same\". Metabolic processes in all organisms can only occur in a very specific physical and chemical environment. Conditions vary from organism to organism and depend on whether chemical processes take place inside the cells or in the interstitial fluid that bathes the cells. The best known mechanisms of homeostasis in mammals are regulators which keep the composition of the extracellular fluid (or \"internal environment\") constant, especially with regard to temperature, pH, osmolality, and concentrations of sodium, potassium, glucose, carbon dioxide, and oxygen. There are many other homeostatic mechanisms that regulate various aspects of physiology in the body. When the level of a variable is higher or lower than required, each of these conditions is often preceded by hyper- and hypo-, such as hyperthermia and hypothermia or hypertension and hypotension. If an entity is controlled through homeostasis, that does not imply that its values \u200b\u200bmust be strictly stable to maintain health. Core body temperature, for example, is regulated by homeostatic mechanisms by temperature sensors, one of which is the hypothalamus in the brain. However, the set point of a regulator is reset regularly. For example, core body temperature in humans varies throughout the day (influenced by circadian rhythms), with the lowest temperature occurring at night and the highest in the afternoon. Normal temperature also varies due to the menstrual cycle. The temperature regulator set point is reset during infection to produce fever. Organisms are able to adapt to various conditions, such as changes in temperature or oxygen levels at a certain altitude, through the acclimatization process.",

In areas with this type, the soil must be turned periodically so that the fertility of the inner soil rises to the top so that it can be used by plants. The short plow design allows deeper penetration while lifting the soil from the inside to go to the surface and the soil on the surface goes down by turning it over. The short plow design made of wood tends to be brittle and easily damaged when working on heavy ground. Also, for deeper penetration in heavy soils, wooden plows cannot be used. Before the Han dynasty, plows in China were made primarily of wood except for the metal plowshares. This is the era where the first known use of metal (iron) in the plow to increase the weight of the plow and increase its strength against the ground. Roman civilization began to develop similar plows with added wheels, in the 3rd and 4th centuries AD. The design of the calipers has not changed for at least a thousand years. A new fundamental change occurred when the Age of Enlightenment began. Joseph Foljambe at Rotherham designed the Rotherham Plow. Developments in metallurgy have led to the development of plows to be more planned with thicker but softer iron alloys for plowshares so they don't break easily.",

The name Wiswamitra also appears in the Ramayana, along with Rishi Wasista. But in the Ramayana, Rishi Wiswamitra comes from a lineage of knights and used to be a king. Vishwamitra was a descendant of a king in Ancient India, and he was also called Kaushika (\"descendant of Kusha\"). He was a brave knight who was the great-grandson of a king named Kusha. One of the four Kusha princes was Kushanubha, who performed the Puthrakameshti ceremony and got a prince named Gadhi as a result. Kaushika, or Wiswamitra, was the son of King Gadhi. Kaushika succeeded her father and ruled well. He is very loved by his people. Once upon a time, King Kaushika (Wiswamitra) and his powerful army rested in the dormitory of Rishi Wasista. With full courtesy, Rishi Wasista greeted King Kaushika. Resi Wasista showed all the beauty and prosperity in his hermitage, including the sacred cow he owned named Sabala. The magical cow can create everything that its employer wants, like a spring that never dries up. Seeing the power of the cow, Kaushika wished to have it. Then he deployed his army to seize Sabala. In response to that, Resi Wasista told Sabala to create an army. So not long after, a battle took place between Kaushika's forces and the forces created by Sabala. When Kaushika's team is desperate, Sabala's team is increasing. Finally Kaushika admits her defeat and leaves Resi Wasista's hostel. After handing over the throne to one of his sons, Kaushika went to the Himalayas and performed penance worshiping Lord Shiva.",

With this magic weapon, Kaushika came back to the Resi Wasista's dormitory. After deploying all the weapons he obtained through tapa, Kaushika was unable to conquer Wasista because only with a stick named Brahmadanda, Wasista was able to paralyze all of Kaushika's magic weapons, including the Brahmastra weapon which is considered the deadliest weapon in Hindu Mythology. Feeling that Lord Shiva's gift was in vain, Kaushika excused himself and left Wasista's hostel in shame. After his defeat at Wasista's hostel, Kaushika meditates on worshiping Lord Brahma to obtain the title Brahmaresi to match the sage Vasista. After many years of asceticism, Lord Brahma appeared willingly and bestowed the title Rajaresi on Kaushika. To obtain the title of Brahmaresi, Kaushika performed very severe tapas. But he could not hold back his anger while doing tapa, so many times his efforts failed. Realizing his mistake, Kaushika continued with heavier tapas. Delighted by his penance, Lord Brahma appeared and gave Kaushika the title \"true sage\". Once upon a time, the strength he had obtained through tapa was drained because he carried out a big ceremony to help King Trisangku. Hence, Kaushika undertook even more severe penances at Pushkara. Seeing Kaushika's determination, the gods sent a beautiful nymph named Menaka to tempt him. Menaka's attempt succeeded so that Kaushika was lulled by Menaka's beauty, until Manaka became pregnant with a daughter who was later named Sakuntala.

After years of severe penance in the Himalayas, Lord Brahma appeared and bestowed the title \"Maharesi\" on Kaushika. But Kaushika was still disappointed with the title he had earned so he did another tapa. Seeing Kaushika's determination, the gods were shocked. Then they sent the angel Ramba to shake Kaushika's tapa. Accompanied by the god Kama (love) and the spring spirit, Ramba goes to tempt Kaushika. They created a beautiful atmosphere in front of Kaushika. Annoyed, Kausika opened her eyes and saw an angel smiling before her. This lustful sight made Kaushika sober, then he cursed Ramba to turn into stone for ten years (some versions say a thousand years). But Kaushika was disappointed because the anger had destroyed the purity of asceticism he had practiced for years. Disappointed, he went to the jungles of the eastern Himalayas and undertook severe penance there. After years of austere penance, Kaushika's body emitted smoke and covered the earth. upon the request of the gods, Brahma appeared before Kaushika. Then Lord Brahma gave the title \"Brahmaresi\" to Kaushika. He also changed Kaushika's name to Wiswamitra, which means \"everyone's friend\" because of his boundless affection.

At that very moment, the animosity between Wiswamitra and Wasista disappeared and turned into friendship. Resi Wiswamitra is a well-known figure in Hinduism and appears in many Hindu legends and mythologies with various versions. The sage Wiswamitra was also frequently associated with the kings of the Surya dynasty, including Ramachandra son of Dasarata. Some of his stories appear in the Ramayana. One of the famous Wiswamitra stories is the creation of \"Trisangku Heaven\". Before Wiswamitra attained the title of Brahmaresi, King Trisangku of the Surya Dynasty approached Wiswamitra and asked for help so that he could reach heaven with a gross body. Trisangku also told his sad story that he was cursed by the sons of Rishi Wasista because the King was disappointed with Rishi Wasista. With compassion, Wiswamitra promised that he would carry out a ceremony to raise King Trisangku to heaven along with his gross body. To support the implementation of the ceremony, Wiswamitra invited prominent rishis and all of them came because they were reluctant to refuse. Wiswamitra's rival, Resi Wasista, also came, but his sons did not participate because they thought that the one who was carrying out the ceremony was a former knight and the person being celebrated was a humiliated king. Angry with the words of Wasista's sons, Wiswamitra cursed them to die and incarnated for seven generations as a tribe that ate dog meat. During the ceremony, none of the gods came to receive the offerings offered by Wiswamitra.

At the request of the gods, Trisangku's body remained floating in the air. Then Wiswamitra created a landscape sprinkled with stars to the south, like a new heaven for Trisangku. He also created a new Indra and new gods. Finally King Trisangku lived in that place which is known as \"Heaven of Trisangku\". Because his great effort had drained the strength he had gained through tapa, Wiswamitra began to meditate again and started from the bottom. He went to Pushkara to perform more severe penances. When Wiswamitra was doing his penance to get the title of Brahmaresi, he helped a boy named Sunasepa who was about to be sacrificed to Baruna, the god of the sea. The ceremony was organized by Raja Harishchandra, and as Prince Rohita was not willing to be sacrificed, Sunasepa's parents offered their son to be sacrificed. On the way to the ceremony, Sunasepa met Wiswamitra who was meditating. Sunasepa knelt at Wiswamitra's feet asking for help. Finally Wiswamitra taught a secret mantra to Sunasepa. When the sacrifice ceremony was held, the child sang the mantra given by Wiswamitra so that Dewa Indra and Baruna were impressed, and also the sacrifice ceremony could run smoothly. In the Ramayana, Wiswamitra becomes a teacher for Rama and Laksmana when they are in the middle of the forest.

Kazakhstan stretches from the Altai Mountains in the east, to the Caspian Sea in the west, making it the 9th largest country in the world and the 2nd largest of the former Soviet Union countries after Russia. Kazakhstan is often referred to as the \"Virgin Land\", because some areas of this country have not been touched at all. Most of Kazakhstan shares a direct border with Russia, especially to the north and west. To the east, it is directly adjacent to China (with the autonomous region of Xinjiang). To the south it is bordered by Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan and the Caspian Sea. There are many Russians living in Kazakhstan. The launch site for the Russian space rocket, Baikonur, is located in Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan proclaimed its independence on December 16, 1991. The Kazakhs are the largest ethnic group occupying the territory of Kazakhstan and are descended from Turkic and Mongol tribes. At the beginning of the XVIII century, Kazakhstan was ruled by Russia. In the nineteenth century, along with the region in Central Asia, Kazakhstan's religious tolerance was 70.2% of all Muslims, 26.6% Christians, 0.1% Buddhists, 0.2% mostly Jews, and 2.8% Atheists, while 0.5% chose not to answer, possibly Christians of mixed Russia or Europe.

Most of Kazakhstan is geographically located in the southwestern part of the Asian continent, and a small part of its territory is in the European continent. The area of \u200b\u200bKazakhstan is 2,717,300 square km which makes it the largest country in Central Asia, and the second largest after Russia among the ex-Soviet Union countries.

Kazakhstan also has three paramilitary units namely the National Guard, the Ministry of Internal Affairs Security Forces, and the border troops. When they turn 18, all men in Kazakhstan are required to serve in the military for 2 years. Kazakhstan's economy largely relies on their natural resources. The texture of the land, which is mostly flat and open and dominated by grasslands, gives Kazakhstan an opportunity to advance their agricultural sector, especially wheat. In addition, the pasture is also a distinct advantage for the livestock sector in Kazakhstan. Under the expanse of the steppe of Kazakhstan, there are deposits of minerals, including oil, which are very abundant. New industries in mining and oil refining continue to develop, something that makes Kazakhstan's economy more diversified. In 2003, their gross domestic products (GDP) touched 29.7 billion US dollars. The service sector makes the largest contribution by contributing 53.9% of Kazakhstan's total GDP. Followed by the industrial sector 38%, and agriculture 8%. The history of the economy of Kazakhstan, both as part of the Soviet Union and as an independent country, has not been encouraging.

When independent, the economy of Kazakhstan experienced a very large decline. Their GDP fell by about 50%, identical to that experienced by most of the former Soviet Union countries. This situation continued throughout the 90s. Entering 2000, Kazakhstan's economy gradually recovered.

This country has very large and diverse iron reserves such as tungsten, tin, copper, manganese, iron ore. Gold is one of the mining commodities that is starting to experience development in Kazakhstan. The country also has substantial reserves of oil and natural gas.

This causes several areas in Kazakhstan to experience a shortage of electricity supply. This was exacerbated by the closing of their nuclear power plant in Aktau in 1999 for security reasons. In 1993, Kazakhstan issued their own coin, the tenge. (1 US dollar is equivalent to 416 tenge as of August 2020).

Although Kazakhstan does trade with other countries, Russia has by far been their main partner. Since independence, Kazakhstan has been increasingly integrated into the world economy along with economic cooperation with fellow former Soviet Union countries. In 1994, they signed an economic agreement with the European Union. In the same year they formed a trilateral economic and defense cooperation with Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan, which was later added to Tajikistan in 1998, under the name Central Asian Economic Forum.

The body of the crab is protected by a very hard shell composed of chitin and armed with a pair of pincers. Ketam is another name for crab. Crabs are found in all the world's oceans. There are also freshwater and land crabs, especially in tropical regions. Rajungan are crabs that live in sea waters and rarely go up to the beach, while yuyu are crabs that live in fresh waters (rivers and lakes). Crabs range in size, from the pea crab, which is only a few millimeters wide, to the Japanese spider crab, with a leg span of up to 4 m. True crabs have five pairs of legs; the first pair of legs is modified into a pair of pincers and is not used for locomotion. In almost all crabs, except for a few (for example, Raninoida), the abdomen is folded under the cephalothorax. The mouth of the crab is covered by a flat maxilliped, and the front of the carapace does not form a long rostrum. Crab gills are formed from flat plates (\"phyllobranchiate\"), similar to those of shrimp, but with a different structure. masked crab, Corystes cassivelaunus Liocarcinus vernalis round crab, Atelecyclus rotundatus The terrestrial halloween crab, Geocarcinus ruricola arrow crab Stenorhynchus seticornis \"Sally lightfoot\", Grapsus grapsus mini crab, Thia scutellata Japanese spider crab, Macrocheira kaempferi ghost crab, Ocypode quadrata fiddler crab , Uca pugnax Lyreidus tridentatus, a raninid Hepatus ephelitus, a calico crab This animal-related article is a stub.",

The term is then used to describe both the intentional community that seeks to create an ideal society, and the imaginary society depicted in works of fiction. Various alternative views regarding the structural and qualitative attributes of society have given rise to other concepts, the most prominent of which is dystopia. The term utopia was coined in Greek by Sir Thomas More for his book Utopia published in 1516, describing a society on an imaginary island in the Atlantic Ocean.

One word can have a broad meaning when alone and have a special meaning when put together (collected). As an example can be said. \"If the two are united then they are different and if the two are separated then they are united\" So the words qada and qadar are included in this condition, meaning that if the word qada is separated (from the word qadar), then it contains qadar and vice versa the word qadar when separated (from the word qada) then contains the meaning of qada. However, when collected, the word qada means something that Allah has ordained for His creatures, whether in the form of creation, annihilation or change. Meanwhile, qadar means something that has been determined by Allah since time immemorial. This is the difference between the two terms. So qadar comes first then followed by qada.

Vaisnawa is a belief and teaching that also has implementation of obligations for its adherents (in Hinduism it is called Bakti Yoga), all of which are based on the Vedas and Purana literature such as the Bhagavad Gita, Isha Upanishad, as well as Wisnu Purana and Bhagavata Purana. This school is divided into several groups (sampradaya), namely: Sri Sampradaya (Vaishnavas who worship Lakshmi as Vishnu's partner), Brahma Sampradaya (Vaishnavas who worship Vishnu exclusively), Rudra Sampradaya (Vaishnavas who worship Vishnu or avatars, such as Kresna, Rama , Balarama, and others), Kumara Sampradaya (Vaishnavas who worship Caturkumara). Some of the main Vaishnava schools can be classified as follows. Sri Sampradaya from Alwar was the earliest Vaisnava teachers. They came from Tamil Nadu, India and lived between the 2nd and 8th centuries of the Masihi. These mystical teachers consisted of various castes including a woman (Andal). Alvar's teaching was that Vishnu-Narayana is the One Supreme God and His devotion is the way to attain Moksha. They received Avatara or Incarnation of Lord Vishnu like Rama and Krishna. They also give priority to the worship of rituals or statues with the strong belief that God incarnates in a subtle form in the statue during worship and prayer. For Ramanuja, Brahman or Isvara in the Vedanta is Narayana (or Maha Vishnu) who is always accompanied by Sri or Lakshmi. Narayana creates or reflects this world with His Prakriti (nature) namely acit (non-living things) and cit (living things, individual souls).",

Sri helps one get what he wants from Narayana, including freedom. Bhakti or faith in both Sri and Vishnu-Narayana is essential for attaining freedom. Since Ramanuja gave the same importance to Sri as Vishnu-Narayana, then, his system is known as Sri Vaishnava. Madhva (1238-1317 AD) was a Hindu philosopher who gave Vaishnava a solid foundation and made it a popular religion in society. His philosophy is known as Dwaita, which can be summarized as follows: From this philosophy of Bhakti there are various related things such as ritual worship, singing sacred songs, also the rise of an organized Bhakti movement. The philosophy of Nimbarka (descent of 12th AD) is known as Dwaitadwaita. God or Parabrahman is Sri Krishna, the supreme independent reality. Jivatman or individual soul is innumerable and atomic in size. Prakrti is the non-living thing that gave birth to this world. Jiva and Prakrti are realities dependent on Parabrahman and cannot be separated from Parabrahman. This relationship is like the relationship between the waves and the sea or the sun and its light. Bhakti to Sri Krena and Radha, surrendering to Them and obeying the spiritual master is the path to freedom. Nimbarka was also the first to introduce Srimati Radha as Sakti-Krishna or His consort. Ramanandi Sampradaya also known as \"Ramayat\" is a branch of Sri sampradaya. This movement succeeded in spreading Vaishnavism by making Sri Rama as the Supreme Lord. Its founder, Ramananda had become a monk in the Ramanuja tradition. However, after that, Ramananda was dropped from Sri Vaishnava by Ramanuja and started the Bhakti movement on Sri Rama.",

In Greek this collection of 5 books is called the Pentateuch (\"five vessels\" or \"five scrolls\"). The Torah is an important part of the Jewish canon/holy book. The five books of the Torah are: The word torah is from the Hebrew verb yarah. In the hifil conjugation, the word \u05d9\u05e8\u05d4 (yarah) means \"to teach, teach, show\" (eg Leviticus 10:11). So the word torah can mean \"teaching\" or \"instruction\", it can be teachings from the mother, teachings from the father, or teachings from God. The most frequently used translation, \"law\", is actually a misnomer, since the Hebrew word for \"law\" is din.

Furthermore, the word \"torah\" is more used in a broad sense, covering both written and oral regulations and eventually encompasses all the teachings of Judaism, including the Mishnah, the Talmud, the Midrash and others. In addition, it can also be translated as \"teaching, instruction, commandment\", or \"custom\" or system.In the Hebrew Bible, this title is used for the first part (\"Ta-\" of \"Tanakh\") is \"Torah of Moses\".

Other ancient titles \"Book of Moses\" (Ezra 6:18; Nehemiah 13:1; 2 Chronicles 35:12; 25:4; compare 2 Kings 14:6) and \"Torah\" (Nehemiah 8:3) appear to be an abbreviation of the full name, \"The Book of the Law of God\" (Nehemiah 8:8, 18; 10:29\u201330; compare Nehemiah 9:3). The term Pentateuch, first used by Greek-speaking Jews in the city of Alexandria, means \"five books\", or as \"Law\", or \"Law of Moses\".

According to manuscripts dated by Orthodox rabbis, this revelation occurred in 1312 B.C.; or according to another calculation, in 1280 BC. Medieval Jewish mysticism believed that the Torah was created before the creation of the world, and was used as the blueprint for creation in the Book of Genesis. Some rabbinical sources state that the entire Torah was given at once on this occasion.

Other rabbinical schools of thought believe that although Moses wrote most of the Torah, its last four verses were written by Joshua after Moses' death. Abraham ibn Ezra and Joseph Bonfils observe that a number of phrases in the Torah provide information that was only known after the death of Moses. Ibn Ezra indicates, and Bonfils explicitly states, that Joshua (or possibly later prophets) wrote these parts of the Torah. Other rabbis did not share this view. In the Talmud (tractate Sabb. 115b) it is stated that there is a special part in the Book of Numbers, namely chapter 10:35-36, which is delimited by 2 Hebrew letters which are deliberately written backwards, is a separate book. A midrash regarding this verse in Mishle's book (\"Proverbs\"; English: \"Book of Proverbs\") states that \"These two verses are from separate books that once existed, but were later removed!.\" Another (possibly earlier) midrash, Ta'ame Haserot Viyterot, suggests that this passage actually comes from the prophetic book \"Eldad and Medad\". In the Talmud it is stated that God dictated the first four books of the Torah, whereas Moses wrote Deuteronomy in his own words. All classical rabbinical views hold that the Torah is wholly or almost entirely of Mosaic origin and of divine origin. In the version of the Masoretic Text which has been the standard edition of the Hebrew Bible for Jews since the 10th century, the number of words and letters in the Torah (Hebrew) has been carefully counted by the Masoretic figure, Aharon Ben Asher, in his writing \"Dikdukei Taamim\" as follows: Is this the exact number of 304,805 letters in the Torah?

Ultimately, of the more than 300,000 letters in the Torah, there are at most a dozen where a letter is questioned. This means that the current text of the Torah is more than 99.99% correct.

This term often refers to the entire ceremony from the removal of the Torah scroll from its place (ark), singing the appropriate song in a special cantillation, until the return of the scroll to the ark. This is different from the academic study of Torah. The public reading of the Torah was introduced by Ezra, the scribe, after the Jews returned from exile to Babylon (~ 537 BC), as recorded in the Book of Nehemiah. In modern times, adherents of Orthodox Judaism perform Torah readings according to a procedure they believe has not changed since 2000 years ago, namely when the Second Temple in Jerusalem was destroyed by Roman armies in AD 70. In the 19th and 20th centuries, New movements such as Reform Judaism and Conservative Judaism have adapted Torah reading practices, but the basic pattern of Torah reading has usually remained the same. The Torah makes up stories, legal statements and ethical statements. Collectively these laws are usually called \"biblical law\" or \"commandments\" also known as the Law of Moses (Law of Moses or Mosaic Law; Torat Moshe, \u05ea\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9\u05e8\u05b7\u05ea\u05be\u05de\u05b9\u05e9\u05b6\u05c1\u05d4).",

The writing was very thorough and only done by highly qualified scribes. This produced copies that have hitherto remained virtually unchanged for thousands of years. It was believed that every word, or sign, had a divine meaning, and that no part should be accidentally changed, lest mistakes be made. The accuracy of the Hebrew text of the Tanakh (the entire Hebrew Bible), and especially the Torah, was considered extraordinary, right down to the last letter: translation or transcription was questionable for official worship use, and copying was always done with great care. An error in a single letter, ornamentation, or symbol in the 304,805 stylized letters, which make up the entire Hebrew Torah, precluded a single Torah scroll from being used, requiring special skill and each scroll taking time to write and proofread. a Torah sefer is reason for great feasting, and it is a Mitzvah for every Jew to copy or have copies of a complete Torah scroll made.",

The predator usually comes from the carnivore type. Some types of predators are ants and birds. The presence of predators can control the population of an animal species, especially on agricultural land. One of the ways that predators are threatened is by the use of pesticides. In an ecosystem there are conditions in which living things eat and are eaten by each other. These conditions in a certain sequence form a food chain. The formation of a food chain is caused by the existence of two types of living things, namely prey and predators. Living things that eat are called predators. Meanwhile, living things that are targeted to be eaten are called prey. In the food chain, predators are generally referred to as consumers. The position of predators in the food chain is at the middle and top trophic levels. In the food chain, carnivore predators prey on herbivore animals. Predators kill their prey to satisfy their food needs. The process of predation by predators can occur at any stage of development in the prey. Predators usually immobilize their prey before eating it. Once the prey is motionless, the predator eats it quickly. Predators need prey of more than one type. Predatory growth can occur if the predator eats more than one type of prey during its life. Carnivorous predators prey on other animals to eat the meat, bones and eggs of their prey. In general, predators are animals that have a larger body than other animals that become their prey. For example, snakes that eat mice, or eagles that eat rabbits.

However, ants can experience a decrease in their ability along with changes in the structure of the vegetation in their habitat. Ants in this case play a role in controlling pest populations. Another advantage is that ants are able to engineer ecosystems by aerating the soil and making nutrient circulation better. On the other hand, ants play a detrimental role in tropical habitats. Ants have the ability to invade and then attack and dominate, thereby threatening the local fauna and flora. These harmful species, for example, are ants from the Wasmania punctata species, which drastically reduce the diversity of other ant species, causing the extinction of other ant species. Birds are a type of predator with the main prey being insects. In ecosystems, birds play a role in controlling insect populations. Humans engineer the presence of predators to control plant-disturbing organisms. Predators are one of the natural enemies for plant-disturbing organisms and the main natural controllers for pests. Humans use basic ecological knowledge about the natural regulation of populations and the balance of ecosystems. Biological control that is carried out with predators as biological agents is the control of population density of pests. Predator populations as natural control agents in biological control are influenced and determined by the development of pest populations. The existence of plant pest predators is maintained by providing refugia land. This land is mixed cropping land with plant species that act as habitat, food sources and resources for plant pest predators.

On the beach, Hanuman and the other wanara met Sempati, a giant wingless bird. He sat alone on the beach waiting for animal carcasses to eat. Because he heard the conversation of the vanaras about Sita and Jatayu's death, Sempati became sad and asked the vanaras to tell what actually happened.

After he set foot there, he disguised himself as a little monkey and looked around for Sita. He sees Alengka as a strong defense fortress as well as a tightly guarded city. He saw the inhabitants singing Vedic mantras and victory hymns to Ravana. But not infrequently there are people with cruel and ugly faces with full weapons. Then he came to Ravana's palace and observed countless beautiful women, but he did not see the miserable Sita. After looking around, he entered a garden that he had never investigated before. There he saw a sad and gloomy looking woman who he believed to be Sita. Then Hanuman saw Ravana seducing Sita. After Ravana failed with his seduction and left Sita, Hanuman approached Sita and told him the purpose of his arrival. At first Sita was suspicious, but Sita's suspicions disappeared when Hanuman handed over Rama's ring. Hanuman also promised help would arrive soon. Hanoman suggested that Sita fly with him to Rama, but Sita refused. He expected Rama to come as a true knight and came to Alengka to save himself.

At the behest of his father, he meditated naked in the Madirda lake. Once upon a time, Batara Guru and Batara Narada were flying across the sky. When he saw Anjani, Batara Guru was so amazed that he ejaculated. The king of the wayang gods rubbed it with tamarind leaves (Javanese: Sinom) and then threw it into the lake. The sinom leaves fell on Anjani's lap. He also picked up and ate it so it contains. When it was time to give birth, Anjani was assisted by the angels sent by Batara Guru. She gave birth to a baby white monkey, while herself returned to a beautiful face and was taken to heaven as an angel.

On the other hand, Hanuman actually succeeded in burning part of the capital city of Alengka. This event is known as Hanuman Obong. After Hanuman returned to Rama's place, the monkey troops set off to invade Alengka. Hanuman appeared as a hero who killed many Alengka troops, for example Surpanaka (Sarpakenaka), Rahwana's younger brother. In the last battle between Rama, he was overwhelmed by Ravana, who has Aji Pancasunya, namely the ability to live forever. Every time Rama's weapon kills Ravana, Ravana instantly revives. Wibisana, Rahwana's younger brother who sided with Rama, immediately asked Hanuman to help. Hanoman lifted Mount Ungaran to be placed on Ravana's corpse when Ravana had just died at the hands of Rama for the umpteenth time.

Formerly known as Kirghizia, is a landlocked and mountainous country located in Central Asia. Kyrgyzstan is bordered by Kazakhstan to the north, Uzbekistan to the west, Tajikistan to the southwest and China to the east. The capital and largest city is Bishkek. Kyrgyzstan's history spans over 2,000 years. Covers various cultures and kingdoms. Historically Kyrgyzstan was at the crossroads of several major civilizations, namely as part of the Silk Road and other commercial and cultural routes. Kyrgyzstan was under foreign domination and achieved sovereignty as a nation-state after the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. After independence, Kyrgyzstan has officially become a sovereign country, although ethnic conflicts persist, rebellions, economic problems, transitional governments and political party conflicts. Kyrgyzstan is a member of the Commonwealth of Independent States, Eurasian Economic Union, CSTO, Shanghai Cooperation Organization, Organization of Islamic Cooperation, Turkish Council, T\u00dcRKSOY community and United Nations (UN). Ethnic Kyrgyz make up the majority of the country's 5.7 million people, followed by significant minorities of Uzbeks and Russians. The official language, Kyrgyz, is closely related to other Turkic languages. The majority of the population (64 percent) are non-denominational Muslims. In addition to its Turkic origin, Kyrgyz culture bears elements of Persian, Mongolian and Russian influence. \"Kyrgyz\" is believed to be derived from the Turkic word \"forty\", referring to the forty clans of Manas, the legendary heroes who united with the forty regional clans against the Uyghurs. Literally, Kyrgyz means We Are Forty. At that time, in the early 9th century, the Uyghurs dominated parts of Central Asia (including Kyrgyzstan), Mongolia, and parts of Russia and China.",

From the 10th century the Kyrgyz migrated as far as the Tian Shan range and maintained their dominance over this region for around 200 years. By the twelfth century the Kyrgyz power had dwindled to the Altai and the Sayan Mountains as a result of the Mongol expansion. With the emergence of the Mongol Empire in the thirteenth century, Kyrgyz migrated south. The Kyrgyz peaceably became part of the Mongol Empire in 1207. Chinese and Muslim sources from the 7th\u201312th centuries AD describe the Kyrgyz as red-haired with white skin and blue eyes, which is indicative of ancient Indo-European tribes such as the Slavs. The descent of the Kyrgyz from the original Siberian population is confirmed on the other hand by recent genetic studies. Due to processes of migration, conquest, marriage, and assimilation, many of the Kyrgyz people who now inhabit Central and Southwest Asia make them mixed, coming from fragments of various tribes, even though they speak the same language. Issyk Kul Lake was a stopover on the Silk Road, a land route for merchants, traders and other travelers from the East to Europe. the Kyrgyz were invaded in the 17th century by the Oirat Mongols, in the mid-18th century by the Qing dynasty, and in the early 19th century by the Uzbek Khanate of Kokand.

Al-Iraq is the name used by the Arabs themselves for this area since the 6th century. Historically Iraq was known as Mesopotamia, which literally means \"between the two rivers\" in Greek. This land became the birthplace of the world's first known civilization, the Sumerian culture, followed by the Akkadian, Babylonian and Assyrian cultures whose influence spread to neighboring areas from about 5000 BC. These civilizations produced the oldest writings and some of the world's first science, mathematics, law and philosophy, thus making this region the center of what is commonly known as the \"Cradle of Civilization\".",

In 1894 B.C.E., the Amorites established a small sovereign state that also included the administrative city of Babylon. During the time of the Akkadian Empire (2335\u20132154 BC), Babylon was just a small city in one of its tributaries. This situation changed during the time of the Old Babylonian Empire. Babylon During Hammurabi's reign, Babylon was enlarged and made the capital. Throughout and after Hammurabi's reign, Babylonia was called \"Land of the Akkadians\" (Akkadian: M\u0101t Akkad\u012b) in memory of the former glory of the Akkadian Empire. In the Christian Bible and the Hebrew Bible/Tanakh, the two countries of Babylon and the capital city of Babylon are referred to as Babylon, or simply the Land of Babylon.

The Babylonian region remained a major center of culture, even after the Babylonian Empire was colonized by other countries.

These policies were continued by his successors, Erisyum I and Ikunum. This policy changed when Sargon I (1920\u20131881 BC) ascended the throne in 1920 BC.

His conquests brought stability to the south of Mesopotamia which had previously been mired in chaos and united the many small states in the region into one nation. It was during the time of Hamurabilah that the area south of Mesopotamia began to be called Babylon (Greek: \u0392\u03b1\u03b2\u03c5\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1, Babylonia). Hammurabi sent his army to the east and invaded the area that a thousand years later became the territory of the Iranian state. He conquered the Elamites, the Gutis, the Lulubi, and the Kasi. To the west, he conquered the Amorite states of Syria (now Syria and Jordan), including Mari and Yamhad, two fairly powerful kingdoms. Hammurabi next fought against the Old Assyrian Empire. The war for sovereignty over Mesopotamia and the Near East was protracted. The Assyrians had controlled most of the Hurian and Hatice areas of southern Anatolia since the 21st century BC, and controlled northeastern Syria and central Mesopotamia in the second half of the 20th century BC. After decades of warring against the great Assyrian kings, Shamsyi-Adad I and Isyme-Dagan I, Hammurabi was finally able to force the next King of Assyria, Mut-Assykur, to pay tribute to Babylon around 1751 BC. This success made Babylonia sovereign over the territories of the Hati people and Hurian people in Anatolia, which had been colonized by Assyria for hundreds of years. One of Hammurabi's most important and last great works was the compilation of Babylonian laws, completing Sumerian, Akkadian, and Assyrian laws that had existed long before. The law was drafted by order of Hammurabi after he had succeeded in expelling the Elamites and establishing his kingdom.",

Probably brought from Babylon to Elam as war booty. This inscription is now stored in the Louvre museum. From before 3000 BC to the reign of Hammurabi, the main cultural and religious center in southern Mesopotamia was the city of Nipur, where Enlil was worshiped as a divine being. Hammurabi made the city of Babylon the new cultural and religious center, and made Marduk the supreme god of southern Mesopotamia, while the Assyrian god, and to a certain extent also the goddess Ishtar, remained the main god of the Assyrians in northern Mesopotamia. The city of Babylon came to be known as the \"holy city,\" the obligatory location for the ceremonial coronations of all the legitimate rulers of southern Mesopotamia. Hammurabi transformed the city of Babylon from a small administrative city into a large and powerful city, extending Babylonian power throughout southern Mesopotamia, and erecting a number of magnificent buildings in the city. The Babylonians ruled by Amorite rulers, like their ancestors in earlier regimes, traded regularly with the Amorite city-states and the Canaanites to the west. These well-established trade relations allowed Babylonian officials and military troops to visit Syria and Canaan on occasion, and Amorite merchants to trade freely throughout Mesopotamia. The closeness of the Babylonian kings to the west lasted long enough. Ami-Ditana, great-grandson of Hammurabi, still calls himself \"king of the land of the Amorites.\" Both father and son Ami-Ditana also had typical Amorite names, namely Abi-Esyuh and Ami-Saduqa.

During the reign of Hammurabi's successor, Samsu-iluna (1749\u20131712 BC), the southern tip of Mesopotamia fell to Ilum-ma-ili, an Akkadian-speaking native king who opposed the sovereignty of the Amorite kings of Babylon. The far south became the Kingdom of the Coastal House, the indigenous nation-state of Mesopotamia that was able to maintain its independence from Babylon until 272 years later. Around 1740 B.C.E., the Akkadian governor of Assyria named Puzur-Sin expelled the Babylonians and their Amorite rulers from Assyria to the north. Puzur-Zin considers King Mut-Assykur to be both a foreigner and a former Babylonian slave. After six years of civil war in the Assyrian Empire, an indigenous king named Adasi succeeded to the throne around 1735 BC, and subsequently ruled over the former Babylonian and Amorite colonies in central Mesopotamia. The same action was also taken by his successor, Bel-bani. The Amorites still had sovereignty over Babylonia, even though their territory had shrunk. Abi-Esyuh, the replacement for Samsyu-iluna, failed to recapture the territory that had been controlled by the kulawangsa Pesisir, and was even defeated by King Damqi-ilisyu II. By the end of his reign, Babylon had fallen into the small and relatively weak state it had initially appeared in, although the city of Babylon was already much larger than it had been before the reign of Hammurabi. Abi-Esyuh was replaced by Ami-Ditana, who was later replaced by Ami-Saduqa. Both Ami-Ditana and Ami-Saduqa were not too weak to try to recapture the areas that were separated from Babylon after the death of Hammurabi, and limited themselves to development activities carried out in a peaceful atmosphere. Syamsu-Ditana was the last Amorite King of Babylon.

Syamsu-Ditana was overthrown from the throne after the city of Babylon fell into the hands of Mursili I, the Hittite king. The Hittites did not rule Babylonia for long, but the damage they caused eventually opened up an opportunity for their Kasi allies to seize power. The date of the sacking of the Babylonian city by the Hittites under the leadership of King Mursili I is considered important in various earlier calculations of the Ancient Near East chronology, because it is used as a benchmark. The estimated time span of the occurrence of the event reaches 230 years, in line with the uncertainty of the duration of the \"Dark Ages\" during the Late Decline of the Bronze Age, resulting in a shift of the entire Mesopotamian Bronze Age chronology based on Egyptian chronology. The approximate dates are as follows: The future ancestor of the Kasi dynasty was Gandasy from Mari. Like the Amorite rulers before them, the Kasi rulers were not natives of Mesopotamia. The Kasi first appeared in the region of the Zagros Mountains, which now includes the northwestern region of Iran. The culture of Mesopotamia from the Bronze Age to the Early Iron Age is sometimes summed up with the term \"Assyrian-Babylonian culture\" because of the close interdependence of ethnicity, language, and culture of the two centers of political power. In the past, the term \"Babylonian State\" or \"Babylonia\", especially in writings from around the beginning of the 20th century, was used with a meaning that also included the early history of the southern region of pre-Babylonian Mesopotamia, and not simply as a designation for the country the city of Babylon alone. In the latest writings, the use of the term \"Babylonia\" as the name of an area has generally been replaced by a more accurate term, namely Sumerian or Sumerian-Akkadian which refers to the pre-Assyrian-Babylonian Mesopotamian civilization.

Walls were painted in striking colors, and sometimes covered with zinc or gold plates, or with tiles. Painted terracotta cones were glued to the walls with plaster to hold torches. In Babylon, instead of relief, a large number of three-dimensional sculptures were made. The oldest examples of such statues are those of Gudea, which look realistic but seem clunky. The rarity of stones in Babylon caused each stone to be highly valued. It was this respect for the value of stones that pushed the Babylonians to a high degree of perfection in the art of cutting precious stones.

Zodiac is one of the inventions of the Babylonians in ancient times, even Babylonian scientists were able to predict the times of solar eclipses and lunar eclipses. There are dozens of cuneiform records of self-observations of eclipses by the Mesopotamians. Babylonian astronomy became the basis for the development of astronomy in Ancient Greece, the Classical Ages, the Sasanian Empire, the Byzantines, the Levant, the Islamic World in the Middle Ages, Central Asia, and Western Europe. Therefore, the science of astronomy during the New Babylonian Empire can be considered the direct ancestor of the science mathematics and astronomy of the Greeks, which became the basis of the scientific revolution in the Western World. Babylonian mathematical texts were profuse and well-edited. In terms of the time of manufacture, the written remains are divided into two groups, namely the group of manuscripts from the Old Babylonian Empire (1830\u20131531 BC), and the group of manuscripts which are mostly from the Seleucid Empire from the 4th or 3rd century. BC. In terms of content, the two groups of manuscripts are almost the same. Hence the nature and content of Babylonian mathematics is arguably stagnant, as there has been very little progress and innovation for nearly two thousand years. doubt \u2013 discuss] The Babylonian mathematical system was a sexagesimal or number system with 60 base numbers. The sexagesimal system is the origin of dividing 1 minute into 60 seconds, dividing 1 hour into 60 minutes, and dividing 1 circle into 360 (60x6) degrees.

Moreover, unlike the Egyptians and Romans, the Babylonians had a true place-value system. The series of numbers are ordered from left to right, from the largest to the smallest value, very similar to the decimal system used today (734 = 7\u00d7100 + 3\u00d710 + 4\u00d71). One of the achievements of the Babylonians in the field of mathematics was correctly calculating the square root of the number 2 up to seven decimal places (YBC clay tablet 7289). The Babylonians seem to have understood the Pythagorean theorem before it was coined by Pythagoras himself, as evidenced by the contents of clay tablets with a date of approximately 1900 BC which Dennis Ramsey translated as follows: The length is equal to 4 and the diagonal is equal to 5. What is the width? The size is not known.4 times 4 is 16 and 5 times 5 is 25. Subtract 16 from 25 and it leaves 9. How many times is 9? 3 times 3 is 9. So the width is 3. Ner (multiple of 600) and sar (a multiple of 3600) is formed from the number 60, corresponding to a distance of 1 degree on the equator. Tablets containing calculations to powers of two and powers of three from 1 to 60 have been found at the Senkera site.

The Babylonians may have been used to applying general rules for measuring the area of \u200b\u200ba flat shape. They calculated the length of the circumference of a circle using the formula three times the length of the diameter, while the area was calculated using the formula one-twelfth the length of the circumference raised to the power of two, and could be right if \u03c0 was taken to equal 3. The volume of a cylinder is calculated using the formula for area of \u200b\u200bbase times height, but volume frustum of a cone or square pyramid is calculated in the wrong way, namely with the formula half the area of \u200b\u200bthe base times the height. Recently found a tablet that uses \u03c0 with a value of 3 1/8 (three eighths). The Babylonians are also known for producing the Babylonian mile, which is roughly equal to today's 11 kilometers (7 miles). The unit used to measure this distance was eventually converted to the mile-time unit which is used to measure the distance traveled by the sun, and therefore a measure of time. The Babylonians also used spacetime graphs to calculate Jupiter's speed. This calculation is a fairly modern idea, which traces back to England and France in the 14th century and predates the integral calculus. The origins of Babylonian philosophy can be traced back to Mesopotamian wisdom literature, which abstracted certain philosophies of life, especially ethics, in the form of dialectics, dialogues, epics, folklore, hymns, song lyrics, prose and proverbs. Babylonian reasoning and rationality developed beyond empirical observation. It is very likely that Babylonian philosophy also influenced Greek philosophy, especially Hellenistic philosophy.

Babylonia is frequently mentioned in the Bible (as Babylon), both in a literal (historical) and an allegorical (allegorical) sense. The reference to Babylon in the Hebrew Bible tends to be historical or prophetic, while the apocalyptic designation of the Whore of Babylon in the New Testament seems more figurative, and is most likely a code word for pagan Rome or some other archetype. The Hanging Gardens of Babylon and the legendary Tower of Babel were seen as symbols of luxury and the hubris of power, respectively. Early Christians sometimes called Rome by the name Babylon.

Large faults in the Earth's crust are the result of the action of plate tectonic forces, with the largest forming boundaries between plates, such as subduction zones or transform faults. The released energy causes rapid movement of active faults which are the main cause of earthquakes. According to geophysics, faults occur when rocks are subjected to low pressure and temperature so that they become brittle. Fault plane is a plane that represents the surface of the fracture on the fault. A fault trace or fault line is the intersection of a fault plane with the ground surface. A common fault trace is plotted on a geological map to represent a fault. Because faults do not usually exist alone, geologists use the term fault zone when referring to complex deformation zones associated with fault planes. Two adjacent non-vertical faults are known as the hanging wall and the footwall. By definition, the hanging wall occurs above the fault plane and the footwall occurs below the fault plane. This terminology comes from the world of mining: when they are working on a tabular mineral body, the miner stands on a footwall under his feet and with the hanging wall above them. Due to the friction and stiffness of the rocks, the rocks cannot slide or flow past one another easily and sometimes all motion stops. When this occurs, stress builds up in the rock and when it reaches a level that exceeds the strain threshold, the accumulated potential energy is dissipated by the release of tension, which is focused onto a plane along which the relative motion is accommodated - the fault.",

A fault in ductile rock can also loosen suddenly when the strain rate is too great. The energy released by instantaneous stress-discharge causes earthquakes, a general phenomenon along transform boundaries. Slip is defined as the relative motion of the geological features present on both sides of the fault plane, and is a displacement vector. sense of slip is defined as the relative movement of the rock on each side of the fault with respect to the other side. In measuring horizontal or vertical separation, the throw of the fault is the vertical component of the dip separation and the heave of the fault is the horizontal component, such as . The slip vector can be assessed qualitatively by studying the drag folds of the strata on both sides of the fault. The direction and magnitude of the heave and throw can be measured simply by finding the same point of intersection on both sides of the fault (called the Piercing point). In practice, it is usually only possible to find the slip direction of the fault, and the approximate vectors of the throws and heaves. Based on the direction of release, faults are classified into three: Based on the direction of motion relative to the hanging wall to the foot wall: Based on whether there is rotational motion: Also known as gravity faults, referring to gravity as the main force that moves it.

Thus, judges are expected to be able to apply the law directly, as in the French expression Le juge est la bouche de la loi (\"The judge is the mouth of the law\"). It is explained further, that in some systems an investigation can be carried out by a judge who functions as an examining judge.

In some civil law systems, this panel may include lay judges. A lay judge, unlike a professional judge, is usually not legally trained. There are voluntary judges and professional judges. A voluntary judge, such as a British judge, is not required to have legal training and is not paid. Meanwhile, professional judges must be legally educated. In the United States, professional judges usually require a Juris Doctor degree, in addition to professional experience. In the US judges who are often appointed are judges who have experience and are usually appointed by the head of state. However, in some US jurisdictions, judges are elected in political elections.",

For this purpose, paddy fields must be able to support stagnant water because rice requires inundation at certain periods of its growth. To irrigate the fields, irrigation systems are used from springs, rivers or rainwater. The latter rice fields are known as rainfed rice fields, while the others are irrigated rice fields. Rice grown in paddy fields is known as wetland rice (lowland rice). On land with a high slope, rice fields are printed with terraces or better known as terraces or swales to prevent erosion and retain water. Terraced rice fields are common on hillsides or mountains in Java and Bali. A study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America found that all types of rice cultivated today, both from indica and japonica species, originate from a single species of wild rice Oryza rufipogon that existed in 8200 years to 13500 years. years ago in China. Lowland rice is cultivated in various countries such as Bangladesh, China, Philippines, India, Indonesia, Iran, Japan, Cambodia, South Korea, North Korea, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. Lowland rice is also grown in Europe, such as in Piedmont (Italy) and Camargue (France). Paddy fields are one of the main sources of atmospheric methane emissions and are estimated to emit between 50 and 100 million tons of methane per year.

There is also archaeological evidence that rice (rice that has been removed from the husk) was stored for military use and funeral processions from the Neolithic to the Han Dynasty in China. Paddy fields as an ecosystem are called by an American anthropologist, Geertz, namely very stable or durable rice fields. The rice fields can continue to produce crops that are virtually undiminished from year to year, often even twice a year. The role of water in the paddy ecosystem is very influential on the dynamics of paddy field life. Here, the thin tropical soil character is overcome by adding nutrients to the rice fields with irrigation water to replace nutrients taken from the soil; nitrogen uptake by blue-green algae growing in warm water; bacterial chemical putrefaction of organic matter, including harvested crop residues left in water; filling the air in the soil with the slow movement of water in the fields; and of course the other ecological functions carried out by irrigation are still unknown. Furthermore, in the paddy field ecosystem there are abiotic and biotic components. The abiotic components consist of edaphic factors or soil fertility as seen from the parameters of Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC), soil organic matter content, total N content, available P, and available K in the soil; and the hydrological factor as seen from the parameter of the depth of the paddy water inundation.",

He was the first to build an accurate and quantitative model of the motion of the Sun and Moon. For this work he used the observations and knowledge accumulated over centuries by the Chaldeans of Babylonia. He was also the first to compile trigonometry tables, which allowed him to solve triangle problems. With his theory of the sun and moon and his numerical trigonometry, he succeeded in developing a method for predicting solar eclipses.

Every year the Kaharingan people in Central Kalimantan will hold a festive event called the Kaharingan Diamond Sign Festival where the activities include several Kaharingan religious competitions such as the Karungut chanting competition, the Panaturan holy book reading competition, the Kandayu chanting competition, the traditional Dayak dance competition, and many more. again. Kaharingan adherents in South Kalimantan also have a place of worship called the Kaharingan Traditional Religion Hall. One of the Kaharingan religious ceremonies that is often performed in South Kalimantan is the Aruh Adat or Aruh Baharin ceremony. The Aruh Adat ceremony aims to express gratitude to the Almighty for bestowing abundant rice yields, and at the same time respecting the spirits of the ancestors who are believed to always protect them from disaster. In East Malaysia (Sarawak and Sabah), the Kaharingan religion is not recognized as part of the Hindu community, so it is considered a society that has not adhered to any religion. Now most of the Dayak tribes in Malaysia are Christians, as well as the Dayak tribes in West Kalimantan, where this happened along with the widespread spread of Protestant Christianity in Kalimantan which began in the 1830s. Meanwhile, most of the Dayak tribes in East Kalimantan and North Kalimantan have embraced Islam.",

The activities of utilizing biological resources that are included in agriculture are commonly understood by people as cultivating plants or cultivating crops and rearing livestock, although its scope can also be in the form of using microorganisms and bioenzymes in the processing of advanced products, such as making cheese and tempeh, or simply extraction, such as catching fish or forest exploitation. The largest part of the world's population makes a living in fields within the scope of agriculture, but agriculture only contributes 4% of world GDP. The agricultural sciences group examines agriculture with the support of supporting sciences. Because agriculture is always bound by space and time, supporting sciences, such as soil science, meteorology, agricultural engineering, biochemistry, and statistics are also studied in agriculture. Farming is a core part of agriculture because it involves a set of activities carried out in cultivation. \"Farmers\" is a term for those who carry out farming businesses, for example \"tobacco farmers\" or \"fish farmers\". Those cultivating livestock are specifically referred to as breeders. Agriculture in a broad sense includes all activities involving the use of living things (including plants, animals and microbes) for the benefit of humans. In a narrow sense, agriculture is defined as plant cultivation activities. Agricultural businesses are given special names for certain farming business subjects. Forestry is farming with plant subjects (usually trees) and cultivated on semi-wild or wild land (forest). Livestock use is subject to dry land animals (particularly all vertebrates except fish and amphibians) or insects (eg bees). The fishery has the subject of aquatic animals (including amphibians and all non-aquatic vertebrates).",

Consideration of environmental sustainability results in aspects of natural resource conservation also being part of agricultural business. All agricultural businesses are basically economic activities, so they require the same basic knowledge of business location management, selection of seeds/seedlings, cultivation methods, yield collection, product distribution, product processing and packaging, and marketing. If a farmer looks at all of these aspects with consideration of efficiency to achieve maximum profit then he does intensive farming. Agricultural business viewed in this way is known as agribusiness. Programs and policies that direct agricultural businesses to this perspective are known as intensification. Because industrial agriculture has always applied intensive farming, the two are often confused. The side of industrial agriculture that pays attention to its environment is sustainable agriculture. Sustainable agriculture, also known as its variations such as organic farming or permaculture, incorporates aspects of the sustainability of the carrying capacity of the land as well as the environment and local knowledge as important factors in calculating its efficiency. As a result, sustainable agriculture usually yields lower yields than industrial agriculture. Modern agriculture today usually employs some components of both poles of the agricultural \"ideology\" mentioned above. In addition to these two, there are also known forms of extensive farming (low input agriculture) which in the most extreme and traditional forms will take the form of subsistence farming, which is only carried out without business motives and solely to meet one's own needs or that of the community. As a business, agriculture has two important characteristics: it always involves large volumes of goods and the production process has a relatively high risk. These two characteristics arise because agriculture involves living things in one or several stages and requires space for these activities and a certain period of time in the production process.",

In addition, the practice of using forests as a source of food is known as the oldest agro-ecosystem. The use of forests as gardens begins with forest-based culture around rivers. Gradually man identified useful trees and shrubs. Until finally artificial selection by humans occurs by removing bad species and varieties and choosing the good ones. Agricultural activities (cultivation of crops and livestock) is one of the earliest activities known to human civilization and completely changes the form of culture. Prehistoric experts generally agree that agriculture first developed around 12,000 years ago from culture in the \"fertile crescent\" region of the Middle East, which includes the Tigris and Euphrates River basins extending westward to present-day Syria and Jordan. The first evidence found points to the cultivation of grain crops (cereals, especially ancient wheats such as emmer) and legumes in the area. At that time, 2000 years after the end of the last Ice Age in the Pleistocene era, the area was full of forests and plains that were very suitable for starting agriculture. Agriculture has been known by people who have reached the culture of young stone (neolithic), bronze and megalithic.

Meanwhile, the peoples of the American continent developed cultivated plants and animals that were completely different from the start. The first livestock to be domesticated were goats/sheep (7000 BC) and pigs (6000 BC), together with the domestication of cats. Cows, horses, buffaloes, yaks began to be developed between 6000 to 3000 years BC. Poultry began to be farmed much later. Silkworms are known to have been domesticated 2000 years BC.

Fiber crops were domesticated at roughly the same time as the domestication of food crops. China domesticated cannabis as a producer of fiber to make boards, textiles, and so on; cotton was domesticated in two different places namely Africa and South America; in the Middle East flax is cultivated. The use of nutrients to condition soil such as manure, compost, and ash has been developed independently in various parts of the world, including Mesopotamia, the Nile Valley, and East Asia.

Since the 1990s, there has been resistance to the environmental effects of conventional agriculture, particularly regarding water pollution, resulting in the growth of the organic movement. One of the main drivers of this movement was the world's first organic food certification, carried out by the European Union in 1991, and the start of reforms to the European Union Common Agricultural Policy in 2005. The growth of organic agriculture has renewed research into alternative technologies such as integrated pest management. and selective breeding. The latest technological developments that are widely used are genetically modified food ingredients. In late 2007, several factors pushed up the price of grains consumed by humans and livestock, causing increases in the prices of wheat (up to 58%), soybeans (up to 32%), and maize (up to 11%) in one year. The biggest contribution has been the increasing demand for grain as an ingredient in animal feed in China and India, and the conversion of food grains into biofuel products. This led to riots and demonstrations demanding lower food prices. The International Fund for Agricultural Development proposes that increasing small-scale agriculture can be a solution to increase food supply and food security.

Economists measure total factor agricultural productivity and find that the United States is now 1.7 times more productive than in 1948. Six countries in the world, namely the United States, Canada, France, Australia, Argentina and Thailand supply 90% of the food grains traded in the world. The resulting water deficit has increased grain imports in many developing countries, and is likely to occur in larger countries such as China and India.

In industrial agriculture, injuries regularly occur from the use of agricultural tools and machinery, and the main cause of injuries is serious. Pesticides and other chemicals are also harmful to health. Workers exposed to pesticides in the long term can cause fertility damage. In industrialized countries where the family all works on the farms they develop themselves, the whole family is at risk. The main causes of fatal accidents in agricultural workers are drowning and injuries caused by machinery. The ILO states that agriculture is one of the economic sectors that endangers the workforce. It is estimated that the death of workers in this sector is at least 170 thousand people per year. Various cases of death, injury, and illness due to agricultural activities are often not reported as incidents due to agricultural activities. The ILO has developed the Health and Safety in Agriculture Convention, 2001, which covers the risks to work in agriculture, the prevention of these risks, and the role of individuals and organizations related to agriculture. The cropping system may vary for each farming area, depending on the availability of resources and constraints; geography and climate; government policy; economic, social, and political pressures; and peasant philosophy and culture.

Farmers do not move, but require higher input intensity of fertilizer and pest control. Industrialization brought about monoculture farming where one cultivar is cultivated on a very large area of \u200b\u200bland. Due to the low level of biodiversity, the use of nutrients tends to be uniform and pests can accumulate in the fields, resulting in increased use of fertilizers and pesticides. On the other hand, a crop rotation system grows successive different crops in a year. Intercropping is when different crops are grown at the same time and on the same land, which is also known as polyculture. In subtropical and arid environments, the planting period is limited to the presence of a rainy season so that it is not possible to grow many annual crops in rotation in a year, or irrigation is required. In all of these types of environments, perennial crops such as coffee and cocoa and agroforestry practices can grow. In temperate climates where grasslands and savannah grow in abundance, the practice of cultivating annual crops and grazing animals is predominant. Livestock production systems can be defined on the basis of feed sources used, which consist of grazing-based, full-house, and mixed livestock systems. In 2010, 30% of the world's land was used for livestock production, employing over 1.3 billion people.

This sector also saw yields increase by an average of 9% per year between 1975 and 2007. During the 20th century, livestock and fish producers used selective breeding to create animal breeds and hybrids that increased yields, regardless of desire to maintain genetic diversity. These trends lead to a significant reduction in genetic diversity and resources in livestock breeds, leading to reduced resistance of livestock to disease. Local adaptations that previously existed in many local race livestock also began to disappear. Grazing-based livestock production relies heavily on landscapes such as grasslands and savannas to feed ruminants. Animal manure is the main nutritional input for the vegetation, but other inputs besides animal manure can be provided depending on needs. This system is important in areas where agricultural crop production is not possible due to climatic and soil conditions. The mixed system uses grazing land as well as artificial feed which is agricultural produce which is processed into animal feed. The cage system maintains livestock in full cages with feed input that must be given every day. Processing livestock manure can be a problem of air pollution because it can accumulate and release large amounts of methane gas.

Agriculture can cause problems through pesticides, nutrient flows, excess water use, loss of natural environment, and other problems. An assessment conducted in 2000 in the UK put the total external cost of addressing environmental problems related to agriculture to be \u00a32343 million, or \u00a3208 per hectare. Meanwhile in the United States, external costs for the production of agricultural crops reach US$5 to 16 billion or US$30-96 per hectare, and external costs for livestock production reach US$714 million.

Both of them did not include subsidies in their analysis, but noted that agricultural subsidies also have an impact on society.

Livestock is also a contributor to greenhouse gases in the form of methane and nitrous oxide which, although the amount is small, but the impact is equivalent to the total emission of CO2. This is because methane and nitrous oxide are stronger greenhouse gases than CO2. Livestock is also accused of being one of the factors causing deforestation. 70% of the Amazon basin that was previously forest is now grazing land, and the rest is land for feed production. Apart from deforestation and land degradation, the cultivation of livestock, which is mostly based on a single race concept, also triggers the loss of biodiversity. The transformation of land towards its use for the production of goods and services is the most substantial way for humans to change the earth's ecosystems, and is categorized as a major driver of biodiversity loss. It is estimated that the amount of land converted by humans is between 39%-50%. Land degradation, the long-term decline in ecosystem function and productivity, is estimated to occur in 24% of the world's land. The FAO report states that land management is the main driver of degradation and 1.5 billion people depend on degraded land. Deforestation, desertification, soil erosion, loss of mineral content, and salinization are examples of forms of soil degradation. Eutrophication is an increase in the population of algae and aquatic plants in aquatic ecosystems due to the flow of nutrients from agricultural land. This can cause a loss of oxygen levels in the water when the number of dead and decaying algae and aquatic plants in the waters increases and decomposition occurs. This can cause fish destruction, loss of biodiversity, and make water unusable as drinking water and the needs of society and industry. Excessive use of fertilizers on agricultural land followed by surface water flow can cause nutrients on agricultural land to erode and flow to nearby waters.",

It is known that aquifers in densely populated places around the world, such as northern China, around the Ganges River, and the western United States, have decreased considerably, and research into this is being carried out in aquifers in Iran, Mexico, and Saudi Arabia. Pressure on water conservation continues to occur from the industrial sector and urban areas which continue to take water unsustainably, resulting in increased competition for water use for agriculture and challenges in producing food as well, especially in water scarce areas. Water use in agriculture can also be a cause of environmental problems, including loss of swamps, spread of water-borne diseases, and land degradation such as soil salinization when irrigation is not carried out properly. Pesticide use has increased since the 1950s, to 2.5 million tonnes per year worldwide. However, the rate of loss of agricultural production remains relatively constant. WHO estimated in 1992 that 3 million people were poisoned by pesticides each year and 200 thousand people died. Pesticides can cause pesticide resistance in pest populations so that the development of new pesticides continues. An alternative argument for this problem is that pesticides are a way to increase food production on limited land, so as to grow more agricultural crops on less land and provide more space for wildlife by preventing the expansion of agricultural land more extensively.",

Agriculture is one that affects climate change, and climate change has an impact on agriculture. Climate change affects agriculture through changes in temperature, rain (period and quantity changes), levels of carbon dioxide in the air, solar radiation, and the interactions of all these elements. Extreme events such as droughts and floods are expected to increase due to climate change. Agriculture is the sector most vulnerable to climate change. Water supply will be critical to sustain agricultural production and provide food. Fluctuations in river discharge will continue to occur due to climate change. Countries around the Nile river have experienced the impact of fluctuations in river discharge which affect seasonal agricultural output which can reduce agricultural output by up to 50%. Transformative approaches are needed to manage natural resources in the future, such as changing policies, practice methods and tools to promote climate-based agriculture and using more scientific information in analyzing risks and vulnerabilities from climate change. Agriculture can both mitigate and exacerbate global warming. Part of the increase in carbon dioxide levels in the Earth's atmosphere is due to the decomposition of organic matter in the soil, and most of the methane gas released into the atmosphere comes from agricultural activities, including the decomposition of agricultural wetlands such as rice fields, and the digestive activities of livestock.",

Since 1940, agricultural productivity has increased significantly due to the intensive use of energy from agricultural mechanization activities, fertilizers and pesticides. Most of this energy input comes from fossil fuels. The Green Revolution changed agriculture around the world with a significant increase in grain production, and today modern agriculture requires the inputs of petroleum and natural gas for energy and fertilizer production. There has been concern that the scarcity of fossil energy will lead to high costs of agricultural production resulting in reduced agricultural yields and food scarcity. Industrialized countries depend on fossil fuels in two ways, namely directly consumed as a source of energy in agriculture, and indirectly as inputs for the manufacture of fertilizers and pesticides. Direct consumption may include the use of lubricants in machinery maintenance, and heat exchange fluids in heating and cooling engines. Agriculture in the United States consumed about 1.2 exajoules in 2002, which is 1% of the total energy consumed in the country. Indirect consumption, namely as the manufacture of fertilizers and pesticides that consumed fossil fuels equivalent to 0.6 exajoules in 2002.

The fuel used in agriculture can vary depending on several factors such as the type of crop, production system and location. The energy used for the production of agricultural tools and machinery is also an indirect form of energy use in agriculture. The food system includes not only agricultural production, but also post-farm processing, packaging, transportation, marketing, consumption, and disposal and processing of food waste. The energy used in this food system is higher than the energy used in agricultural production, which can be up to five times. In 2007, higher incentives for farmers growing biofuel-producing non-food crops coupled with other factors such as the reuse of less fertile idle land, increased transport costs, climate change, increasing number of consumers, and increasing world population, led to food insecurity and increase in food prices around the world.

In the scarcity of fossil fuels, organic farming will be prioritized over conventional farming which uses so many petroleum-based inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides.

Rural communities can take advantage of biochar and synfuel which use agricultural waste to be processed into fertilizer and energy, so they can get fuel and food at the same time, compared to the food vs. fuel competition that still exists today. Synfuel can be used on-site; the process will be more efficient and able to produce enough fuel for all organic farming activities. While genetically modified foods (GMOs) are still being criticized because the seeds they produce are sterile so they cannot be reproduced by farmers and the results are considered harmful to humans, it has been proposed that these types of crops be further developed and used as fuel producers, because these crops can be modified. to produce more with less energy input.

At the same time, agricultural practices using traditional races produce more of the same type of crop and are carried out in a sustainable manner.

Combining agricultural production with general theories about marketing and business is a discipline that started in the late 19th century, and continued to grow throughout the 20th century.

However, these changes can result in the transfer of economic surplus from producers (farmers) to consumers, and have a negative impact on rural communities. Digitalization needs to respond to labor limitations and also increase efficiency which can increase business productivity, value, products and new consumers to disrupt conventional cultivation technology. Both during the process and even to marketing agricultural products, digitization is so efficient. Slowly, farmers are not stuttering about digital technology, and can even increase the productivity of the agricultural sector. Of course, there are still many tasks to turn farmers into digital farmers. A country's government policies can significantly affect the market for agricultural products, in the form of taxes, subsidies, tariffs, and other duties. Since the 1960s, a combination of export-import restrictions, exchange rate policies, and subsidies has affected agriculture in both developing and developed countries. In the 1980s, farmers in developing countries who did not receive subsidies were unable to compete because policies in various countries caused low food prices. Between the 1980s and 2000s, several countries around the world made agreements to limit the tariffs, subsidies, and other trade restrictions imposed on world agriculture.

In Islam, angels are creatures created by Allah SWT who have something in common with humans, namely to worship Allah SWT, angels themselves must be believed in their existence, including the second pillar of faith, angels were created by Allah SWT from Nur (light), angels were created to have a task that has been given by Allah SWT (Kemendikbud 2013:91), Angels are creatures created by Allah SWT who do not eat and do not drink and also do not have lust like humans. An angel who is always obedient to Allah SWT and also never disobeys Allah SWT. The word angel arose in modern English from Old English (pronounced with a hard g) and Old French.",

The translation \"\u00e1ngelos\" is the standard Septuagint translation of the Biblical Hebrew term mal'\u0101kh, which denotes simply \"messenger\" without shows its nature. In the associations that follow in the Latin Vulgate, this meaning becomes twofold: when mal'\u0101kh or \u00e1ngelos are supposed to denote human messengers, words like nuntius or legatus are applied. If the word refers to a supernatural being, the word angelus appears. Such differentiation has been overtaken by local language translations of the Bible, early Christian and Jewish interpreters and eventually modern scholars. In Arabic etymology, the word \"Angel\" is a plural word that comes from the Arabic malak (\u0645\u0644\u0643) which means strength, which comes from the word mashdar \"al-alukah\" which means treatise or mission, then the missionary is usually called ar-rasul. Angels created by Allah SWT are made of light (nur), based on one hadith of the Prophet Muhammad SAW, \"Angels have been created from light.\" Faith in angels is part of the Pillars of Faith. Faith in angels means believing in the existence of angels, even though we cannot see them, and that they are one of God's creatures. Allah created them from light.

The Qur'anic word for angel ( \u0645\u0644\u0643 malak) comes from Malacca, which means \"he controls\", because their power to govern different affairs is assigned to them, or from the roots of either '-lk, l -'-k or mlk with the broad meaning of a \"messenger\", as in Hebrew (mal\u02be\u00e1kh) and Greek (angelos). Unlike Hebrew, this term is used exclusively for heavenly spirits from the divine world, but not for human messengers. The Quran refers to angelic messengers and human \"rasuls\" instead. The Koran is the primary source for the Islamic concept of angels. Some of them, such as Gabriel and Michael, are mentioned by name in the Qur'an, others are named only by their function. In hadith literature, angels are often assigned to only one particular phenomenon. Angels play an important role in the Isra Miraj, where Muhammad met several angels during his journey through heaven. The following angels are often featured in Islamic eschatology, Islamic sciences, and Islamic philosophy. The duties assigned to angels include, for example, communicating revelations from God, glorifying God, recording each person's actions, and retrieving the Soul at death. In Islam, as in Judaism and Christianity, angels are often represented in anthropomorphism combined with images of the supernatural, such as wings, being massive or wearing heavenly bodies. The Koran describes them as \"messengers with wings \u2014 two, or three, or four (in pairs): He is God] adding to Creation at will...\" A common characteristic for angels is their missing need for bodily desires, such as eating and drinking. .",

Muslims generally have no perception of the depiction of angels, as found in Western art. Although belief in angels remains one of the Pillars of Faith in Islam, no dogmatic angelology can be found in the Islamic tradition. Despite this, scholars have discussed the role of certain angels in Isra Mikraj, and the verses of the Qur'an. Even if they are not researched with focus, they have been featured in various folk tales, philosophical debates and the science of penmanship. While in the Age of Islamic Prosperity, the spread of the idea was accepted as canonical, there is a contemporary tendency of scholars to reject many studies about angels, such as calling the Angel of Death by the name of Azra'il. Ibn Sina, who took advantage of the Emanations of Neoplatonism from Al-Farabi, developed an angelological hierarchy of Intellects, created by the \"Monad (philosophy)\". Therefore, the first creation by God was the highest angel followed by other archangels, identified with the lower Intellect. Further, there are lower angels or \"moving spheres\", which in turn, emit other Intellects until they reach the limits of the intellect, which rule over souls. The tenth intellect is responsible for creating material form and illuminating the mind. In folk religion, each angel can appear in Ruqyah (ruqyah), whose name is engraved in amulets. Some Islamic Modernisms have emphasized a metaphorical reinterpretation of the concept of angels. Angels are spiritual beings created by God who are assigned by God for several specific purposes in accordance with His plan, both to serve God and to help believers. The word \"malak\" or angel comes from the Hebrew language \u05de\u05dc\u05d0\u05da, mal'akh, which also means \"messenger\".",

The Biblical term \"angel\", \u05de\u05dc\u05d0\u05da (\"malakh\"), has meaning only when it is mentioned together with its sender, namely YHWH Himself, as for example in \"angel of YHWH\", or \"angel of God\". Another term that is also used is \"sons of God\". Angels are referred to as \"guardians\". They are referred to as \"the army of the heavens\" or the army of \"Elohim\". This \"army\" is also associated with the stars, because the stars are considered to be closely associated with the angels. However, YHWH distinguished Himself from the angels, and because of this the Hebrew people prohibited Moses from worshiping the \"army of heaven\". Prior to the rise of monotheism in Israel, the idea of \u200b\u200ban angel is found in the Mal'akh Yahuwah, the angel of YHWH, or the Mal'akh Elohim. Mal'akh Yahweh is an appearance or manifestation of Yahuwah in human form. The term Mal'akh Yahuwah is used interchangeably with Yahuwah. Those who saw Mal'akh Yahuwah said they had seen God. Yahuwah's Mal'akh (or Elohim) appeared to Abraham, Hagar, Moses, Gideon, &c., and led the Israelites in a pillar of cloud. The phrase Mal'akh Yahweh may be a polite greeting for the Divine King; but instead became a means of avoiding anthropomorphism, and later, when angels were grouped, Mal'akh Yahweh meant \"angel of high rank\". The equation of Yahuwah's Mal'akh with the Logos, or the second Person of the Trinity, is shown not by reference to the Hebrew scriptures, but the idea of \u200b\u200bidentifying the Being with God, but who is in some way different from Him, illustrates the tendency of Jewish religious thought to distinguish the person -personal in the oneness of God.

The prophet Ezekiel, as a prophet at the Exile, may have been influenced by the hierarchy of supernatural beings in the Babylonian religion, and perhaps by the angelology of Zoroastrianism, but it is not clear that this Zoroastrian doctrine developed so early. Ezekiel 9 gives a detailed description of cherubim (a type of angel). In one of his visions Ezekiel saw 7 angels executing God's judgment on Jerusalem. As in the Book of Genesis, they are described as \"humans\"; mal'akh, because \"angel\", does not appear in the Book of Ezekiel. Later, in Zechariah's vision, angels played an important role. They are referred to sometimes as \"man\", sometimes as mal'akh, and Yahuwah's Mal'akh seems to occupy a prominent place among them. In post-biblical times, the heavenly armies have become increasingly organized. Angels also become diverse, also have names. In the beginning all angels were created in good condition, holy and without blemish. However, there are some fallen angels who choose to rebel against God. These fallen angels are referred to as demons, and possibly Cherubs among them.

'Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1 describes the angel as \"a confirmation of God and His heavenly power\" and as \"a blessed being who has severed all ties with this nether world\" and is \"released from the chains of self\", and a \"revealer of God's abundant graces\".

In it, a guardian angel named Arcade organizes a rebellion against heaven after learning about science. Within Zoroastrianism there are different angel-like figures. For example, each person has one guardian angel, which is called Fravashi. They protect humans and other beings, and also manifest God's energy. Amesha Spentas is often seen as an angel, though in no direct reference, but rather an emanation of Ahura Mazda (\"Wise God\", God); which appears at first in the abstract and then personalised, related to various aspects of divine creation. In Proclus' (4th century, under Christian rule) commentary on Plato's Timaeus, Proclus uses the term \"angel\" (aggelikos and aggelos) in reference to metaphysical beings. According to Aristotle, just as there is a primary spiritual mover, so there must also be a secondary spiritual mover. Poetry from the Sikh holy book - Sri Guru Granth Sahib - figuratively refers to a messenger or angel of death, sometimes as Yam (\u0a1c\u0a2e - \"Yam\") and sometimes as Azrael (\u0a05\u0a1c\u0a30\u0a3e\u0a08\u0a32\u0a41 - \"Ajraeel\"): At the same time, Sri Guru Granth Sahib speaks of the figurative Chitar (\u0a1a\u0a3f\u0a24\u0a4d\u0a30) and Gupat (\u0a17\u0a41\u0a2a\u0a24\u0a41): However, Sikhism has never had a literal system of angels, preferring guidance without explicit appeals to supernatural orders or beings. According to the Kabala as described by Golden Dawn, there are ten archangels, each commanding one of the angelic choirs and corresponding to one of the Sephiroth. This is similar to the Jewish angelic hierarchy. In the teachings of the Theosophical Society, the Devas are thought to live in the atmospheres of the planets of the solar system (Planetary Angels) or in the Sun (Solar Angels) and they help guide the operation of natural processes such as those of evolution and plant growth; their appearance was said to be that of human-sized colored flames.",

In physics, light is electromagnetic radiation, with both visible and invisible wavelengths. Moreover, light is a packet of particles called photons. Both definitions are properties that light exhibits simultaneously so it is called \"wave-particle dualism\". Packages of light called the spectrum are then perceived visually by the sense of sight as colors. The field of study of light, known as optics, is an important research area in modern physics. The study of light began with the emergence of the era of classical optics which studied optical quantities such as: intensity, frequency or wavelength, polarization and phase of light. The properties of light and its interaction with the surroundings are carried out using a geometric paraxial approach such as reflection and refraction, and an approach to its physical optical properties, namely: interference, diffraction, dispersion, polarization. Each study of classical optics is called geometrical optics (en:geometrical optics) and physical optics (en:physical optics). At the peak of classical optics, light was defined as an electromagnetic wave and sparked a series of discoveries and thoughts, dating back to 1838 by Michael Faraday with the discovery of cathode rays, 1859 with the theory of black mass radiation by Gustav Kirchhoff, 1877 Ludwig Boltzmann said that the energy states of physical systems can be became discrete, quantum theory as a model of black mass radiation theory by Max Planck in 1899 with the hypothesis that radiated and absorbed energy could be divided into discrete quantities called elemental energies, E.

The work of Albert Einstein and Max Planck won the Nobel Prizes in 1921 and 1918 respectively and became the basis for the theory of quantum mechanics developed by many scientists, including Werner Heisenberg, Niels Bohr, Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, Max Born, John von Neumann, Paul Dirac, Wolfgang Pauli, David Hilbert, Roy J. Glauber and others. This era was later called the era of modern optics and light was defined as the dualism of electromagnetic transverse waves and streams of particles called photons. Further development occurred in 1953 with the discovery of the maser beam, and laser light in 1960. The era of modern optics did not necessarily end the era of classical optics, but introduced other properties of light, namely diffusion and scattering. The Ancient Greeks believed that everything was composed of the four elements of fire, air, earth and water. In the fifth century BC, Empedocles stated that the goddess Aphrodite created the human eye from these four elements. He also kindled a fire in the eyes so that rays came out of the eyes and allowed humans to see. Empedocles added that there is an interaction between light from the eye and light from sources such as the sun so that humans cannot see at night. Around 300 BC, Euclid wrote his Optica which discussed the properties of light. Euclid stated that light travels in straight lines and he studied the laws of reflection mathematically.

Species that are hypothesized to have a common ancestor are placed in a single genus. Species similarity is assessed based on a comparison of physical attributes and if available, their DNA sequences.

Aristotle and other scientists chose species as distinct and fixed (unchanging) with \"essence\" like chemical elements. When early researchers began to develop systems of organization in living things, they began to place previously isolated species into context. Many of these early description schemes were considered odd and included relationships based on color (all plants with yellow flowers) or behavior (snakes, scorpions, and certain stinging ants). John Ray (1686), an English naturalist, was the first scientist to give a biological definition of the term \"species,\" as follows: \"...there is no more definite criterion in determining species for me than appearance/the special features which distinguish them after they have grown. develop from the seed, so that it does not matter what variations occur in the individuals or species, if they develop from the same seed, the variations are consequential variations and not due to variations are carried out by species differentiation... Likewise with animals, different animals specifically permanently distinguish their species; one species never grows from the seed of another species or vice versa\".

Pure gases can be composed of atoms (for example noble gases such as neon), molecular elements composed of one type of atom (eg oxygen), or compound molecules composed of many different types of atoms (eg carbon dioxide). The gas mixture will contain a variety of pure gases such as air. What distinguishes gases from liquids and solids is the separation of the very large gas particles. This separation usually makes the colorless gas invisible to human observation. The interaction of gas particles in the presence of electric and gravitational fields can be neglected as shown by the constant velocity vector in the figure. One type of gas that is commonly known is steam. Gaseous matter is found between the liquid and plasma states, note 1] the latter provides an upper temperature limit for gases. The lower limit of the temperature scale lies degenerative quantum gases note 2] which are receiving increasing attention. note 3] High density atomic gases that are supercooled at very low temperatures are classified according to their statistical behavior as either Bose gases or Fermi gases. For a complete list of the forms of this exotic matter see list of states of matter. The only chemical elements that make up the diatomic homonuclear molecule at STP are hydrogen (H2), nitrogen (N2), oxygen (O2), and two halogens: fluorine (F2) and chlorine (Cl2). When grouped together with the monatomic noble gases \u2013 helium (He), neon (Ne), argon (Ar), krypton (Kr), xenon (Xe), and radon (Rn) \u2013 these gases are referred to as \"elemental gases.\" \" or \"elemental gases\".

According to Paracelsus' terminology, chaos meant something like \"ultra-scarce water\". Another story is that van Helmont's words are truncated from gahst (or geist), which means ghost or spirit. This is because certain gases depict a supernatural origin, such as from their ability to cause death, extinguish fires, and occur in \"mines, well bottoms, churchyards and other deserted places\". Because most gases are difficult to observe directly, they are described by four physical properties or macroscopic characteristics: pressure, volume, number of particles (chemists classify them by moles) and temperature. These four characteristics have been repeatedly observed by scientists such as Robert Boyle, Jacques Charles, John Dalton, Joseph Gay-Lussac and Amedeo Avogadro for various gases in various situations. Their detailed studies eventually yielded a mathematical relationship between these properties which is expressed by means of the ideal gas law (see simplified models section below). Gas particles are separated far from each other and, as a result, have weaker intermolecular bonds than liquids or solids. These intermolecular forces result from electrostatic interactions between gas particles. The similarly charged gas regions with different gas particles repel each other, while the differently charged regions attract one another; gas containing permanently charged ions is known as plasma. Gaseous compounds with polar covalent bonds contain a permanent charge imbalance and thus experience relatively strong intermolecular forces, even though the net charge of the compound remains neutral.",

The interaction of these intermolecular forces varies within the substance which determines many of the physical properties unique to each gas.note 5]note 6] A comparison of the boiling points for compounds formed by ionic and covalent bonds leads us to this conclusion. The moving smoke particles floating in the image provide some insight into the behavior of low pressure gases. Compared to other states of matter, gases have low density and viscosity. Pressure and temperature affect the particles in a given volume. This variation in particle separation and velocity is referred to as compressibility. The separation and size of these particles affect the optical properties of gases as can be found in the following list of refractive indices. Finally, the gas particles spread apart or diffuse to distribute them evenly throughout the vessel. When observing gases, it is usually determined using a frame of reference or a length scale. The larger length scale corresponds to the macroscopic scale or global point of view of the gas. This region (called the volume) must be deep enough to accommodate a large sample of gas particles. The resulting statistical analysis of this sample size yields the \"average\" behavior (i.e. velocity, temperature or pressure) of all gas particles in this region. Conversely, the smaller length scale corresponds to the microscopic scale or point of view of the particle. On a macro level, the gas characteristics that are measured are in terms of the gas particles themselves (velocity, pressure, or temperature) or their surroundings (volume). For example, a small part of Robert Boyle's career was studying pneumatic chemistry. One of his experiments concerned the macroscopic properties of gas pressure and volume. His experiment used a J-tube manometer that looked like a J-shaped test tube. Boyle trapped an inert gas with a column of mercury at the closed end of the test tube, thereby keeping the number of particles and temperature constant.",

Furthermore, when Boyle multiplied the pressure and volume of each observation, the result was a constant. This relationship held for every gas Boyle observed, leading to Boyle's law, PV=k{\\displaystyle PV=k}, which is named after his work in this field. There are many mathematical instruments available for analyzing the properties of gases. Due to the extreme gas conditions, these instruments are slightly more complex, from the Euler en] equation for non-viscosity flow to the Navier\u2013Stokes equation which fully takes into account the effects of viscosity. These equations are adapted to the conditions of the gas system in question. Boyle's laboratory equipment made it possible to use algebra to derive the results of his analysis. The results were possible because he studied gases under relatively low pressure situations, situations in which the gases behaved \"ideally\". This ideal relationship is applied to safety calculations for various flight conditions for the materials used. The high-tech equipment used today is designed to help us safely explore exotic operating environments where gases no longer behave \"ideally\". This high-level mathematics, including statistics and multivariable calculus, allows solving complex dynamic situations such as the reentry of the shuttle back to Earth. An example is the analysis of images of the shuttle's entry into the Earth's atmosphere to ensure the properties of materials are suitable under such extreme conditions. In this flight area, gas no longer behaves ideally. The symbol or symbol used to represent pressure in the equation is p or P with the SI units of Pascal.

The force exerted by the gas particles on the container during these collisions is the change in the momentum of the particles. During a collision, only the velocity of the normal component changes. Particles moving parallel to the wall do not experience this change in momentum. Therefore, the average force on the surface of the container wall must be the average change in linear momentum over all the collisions of these gas particles. Pressure is the sum of all the normal component forces exerted by the particles striking the walls of the container divided by the surface area of \u200b\u200bthe walls. The symbol or symbol used to indicate temperature in the equation is T with the SI unit kelvin. The speed of gas particles is directly proportional to their absolute temperature. The volume of the balloon in the video shrinks as the trapped gas particles are slowed down by the addition of supercooled nitrogen. The temperature of any physical system is related to the motion of the particles (molecules and atoms) that make up the gaseous system]. In statistical mechanics, temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy stored in particles. This energy storage method is dictated by the degrees of freedom of the particles themselves (energy mode). The kinetic energy added (endothermic process) to the gas particles through collisions results in linear motion, rotation and vibration. In contrast, adding heat to the molecules of a solid can only increase its vibrational mode because the crystal lattice structure prevents both linear and rotational motion. These heated gas molecules have a greater range of velocities which are always varying due to constant collisions with other particles. The speed range can be described by the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. Use of this distribution implies an ideal gas near thermodynamic equilibrium for the particle system under consideration.",

The symbol used to represent volume in the equation is \"V\" with the SI unit cubic meter (m3). When carrying out thermodynamic analysis, it is customary to discuss extensive and intensive properties. Properties that depend on the amount of gas (both mass and volume) are called extensive properties, while properties that do not depend on the amount of gas are called intensive properties. Specific volume is an example of an intensive property because it is the ratio of volume to a unit mass of gas that is identical throughout the system at equilibrium. A thousand gas atoms occupy the same space as 1000 other atoms at a given temperature and pressure. This concept is easier to visualize for incompressible solids like iron en] than for gases. Volume is an extensive property, because a gas fills any container it occupies. The symbol used to represent density in the equation is \u03c1 (rho) with the SI units of kilograms per cubic meter. This term is the inverse of the multiplication\u00a0en] of the specific volume. The mass of a gas is usually characterized by its density, because the gas molecules can move freely within the container. Density is the amount of mass per unit volume of a substance, or the reciprocal of specific volume. For gases, the density can vary over a wide range because the particles are free to move closer together when constrained by pressure or volume. This variation in density is referred to as compressibility. Like pressure and temperature, density is a state variable en] of a gas and the change in density during any process is governed by the laws of thermodynamics. For a static gas, the density is the same throughout the container. Therefore, density is a scalar quantity. It can be shown by kinetic theory that density is inversely proportional to the size of the container where there is a fixed gas mass limitation.",

If one could observe a gas under a powerful microscope, one would see a collection of particles (molecules, atoms, ions, electrons, etc.) with no definite shape or volume, which are in more or less random motion. These neutral gas particles only change direction when they collide with other particles or hit the side of a container. In an ideal gas, these collisions are very elastic. This particle or microscopic appearance of gases is explained by the kinetic theory of gases. The assumptions behind this theory can be found in the postulates section of Kinetic Theory. Kinetic theory provides insight into the macroscopic properties of gases by considering their composition and molecular motion. Starting with the definitions of momentum and kinetic energy,note 7] one can use the conservation of momentum and the geometric relationships of a cube to relate the properties of macroscopic systems of temperature and pressure to the microscopic properties of the kinetic energy per molecule. This theory provides an average value for these two properties. This theory also explains how gas systems respond to change. For example, when a gas is heated from absolute zero, when it is at rest (in theory), its internal energy (temperature) increases. When the gas is heated, the rate of the particles is accelerated and the temperature rises. This results in a greater number of collisions with the container per unit time as the particle speed becomes higher with respect to the increase in temperature. The increase in pressure is directly proportional to the number of collisions per unit time. Brownian motion is a mathematical model used to describe the random motion of particles suspended in a fluid. An animation of gas particles, using pink and green particles, illustrates how this behavior results in gas distribution (entropy). This event is also explained in particle theory.",

        "paragraph": "Since to observe gas particles (atoms or molecules) are at (or exceed) the limits of current technology, only theoretical calculations can give suggestions about their motion, but their motion differs from Brownian motion in that Brownian motion involves smooth bending due to the large frictional forces. gas molecules, punctuated by violent collisions between (several) gas molecules and their particles. Therefore, particles (usually consisting of millions or billions of atoms) move in a zigzag, but not so zigzag as would be expected when looking at individual gas molecules. As previously discussed, instantaneous attractive (or repulsive) forces between particles have an effect on gas dynamics. In physical chemistry, these intermolecular forces are called van der Waals forces. These forces play a key role in determining the physical properties of gases such as viscosity and flow rate (see section on physical characteristics). Ignoring this force under certain conditions (see Kinetic theory of gases) allows real gases to be treated like ideal gases. This assumption allows the use of the ideal gas law which greatly simplifies the calculations. Proper use of this gas relationship requires a theory of gas kinetics. When gas particles have a magnetic charge or intermolecular forces, they gradually affect one another as the distance between them decreases (the hydrogen bond model is one example). In the absence of any charge, at a certain point when the distance between gas particles is greatly reduced, they can no longer avoid collisions with each other at normal gas temperatures. Another case for increasing collisions between gas particles would involve a fixed volume of gas, which on heating would contain very fast particles. This means that this idealized equation gives reasonable results except for conditions of high pressure (compressed) or high temperature (ionized).",

        "paragraph": "It should be noted that all of these exceptional conditions allow energy transfer to take place in gaseous systems. The absence of internal transfer is what is referred to as an ideal condition in which energy exchange only occurs at the boundaries of the system. Real gases experience some of these collisions and intermolecular forces. If this collision is statistically negligible (incompressible), the result of this ideal equation is still significant. When gas particles are compressed close together, they behave more like liquids (see fluid dynamics). An equation of state (for gases) is a mathematical model used to describe or roughly predict the state properties of a gas. Currently, there is no single equation that can accurately predict the properties of all gases under all conditions. Therefore, a number of much more accurate equations of state have been developed for gases at certain temperatures and pressure ranges. The most discussed \"gas models\" are \"perfect gases\", \"ideal gases\" and \"real gases\". Each of these models has its own set of assumptions to facilitate the analysis of a given thermodynamic system. Each successive model broadens the range of temperature coverage to be applied. The equation of state for an ideal or perfect gas is the ideal gas law and is expressed as where P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the amount of gas (in moles), R is the gas constant, 8.314 J\u00b7mol\u22121\u00b7K\u22121, and T is temperature. Writing this way is sometimes called the \"chemist's version\", because it emphasizes the number of molecules n.

        "paragraph": "The ideal gas law makes no assumptions about the specific heat of gases. In the most general case, the specific heat is a function of temperature and pressure. If pressure dependencies are neglected (and possibly temperature dependencies too) in a given application, a gas is sometimes said to be a perfect gas, although the exact assumptions may vary, depending on the author and/or field of science. For ideal gases, the ideal gas law applies without limitation on specific heats. An ideal gas is a simplified \"real gas\" assuming that the compressibility factor Z is set at 1 meaning that this pneumatic ratio remains constant. A compressibility factor of one also requires four state variables to obey the ideal gas law. This approach is more suitable for applications in engineering although simple models can be used to generate \"ball park\" ranges where the actual solution has to be rigged. An example where an \"ideal gas approximation\" would be appropriate is in the combustion chamber of a jet engine. It may also be useful to keep track of elementary reactions and chemical dissociations for calculating emissions. Each of the assumptions listed below adds to the complexity of solving the problem. As the density of gases increases with increasing pressure, intermolecular forces play a more substantial role in gas behavior resulting in the ideal gas law no longer giving \"reasonable\" results. At the upper end of the engine temperature range (eg burner section \u2013 1300 K), the complex fuel particles absorb internal energy by means of rotation and vibration which causes their specific heat to vary from that of diatomic molecules and noble gases. At temperatures more than double that temperature, excitation of electrons and dissociation of gas particles begins to occur which causes the pressure to adjust to the greater number of particles (transition from gas to plasma).",

Real gas effects include adjustments made to account for a wider range of gas behaviors: For most applications, such detailed analysis is redundant. Examples where the \"Real Gas effect\" has a significant impact are on the return of the space shuttle to the atmosphere where the temperature and pressure are very high or the gases produced during geological events as in the 1990 eruption of Mount Redoubt. Boyle's Law is probably the first expression of an equation of state. In 1662 Robert Boyle performed a series of experiments using a J-shaped glass tube, which was sealed at one end. Mercury is added to the tube, trapping a certain amount of air in the short, closed end of the tube. Then the volume of the gas was carefully measured as mercury was added to the tube. The gas pressure can be determined by the difference between the mercury level at the short end of the tube and that at the long open end. Boyle's apparatus drawing shows some of the unique tools Boyle used while studying his gas. Through these experiments, Boyle noted that the pressure exerted by a gas held at a constant temperature varies inversely with the volume of the gas.

He noted that for an ideal gas at constant pressure, volume is directly proportional to temperature: In 1802, Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac published similar results, though through more extensive experiments. Gay-Lussac acknowledged Charles' earlier work by naming his law in Charles' honor. Gay-Lussac himself is credited with the law describing pressure, which he discovered in 1809. He stated that the pressure exerted by an ideal gas is directly proportional to its temperature. In 1811, Amedeo Avogadro verified that equal volumes of pure gas contain the same number of particles. His theory was not immediately recognized until 1858 when another Italian chemist Stanislao Cannizzaro was able to explain non-ideal exceptions. For his work with gases a century earlier, the number named after him Avogadro's number represents the number of atoms found in 12 grams of element carbon-12 (6.022\u00d71023 mol\u22121). This specific number of gas particles, at standard temperature and pressure (ideal gas law) has a volume of 22.40 L, which is known as the molar volume.

The pressure of a mixture of unreactive gases is equal to the sum of the pressures of the individual gaseous constituents. Mathematically, this can be written for n species as: Dalton's journal drawings illustrate the symbology he used as shorthand to record the path he followed. Among his major journal observations about mixing unreactive \"elastic fluids\" (gases) are the following: Thermodynamicists use this factor (Z) to modify the ideal gas equation to account for the compressibility effect of real gases. This factor represents the ratio of actual to ideal specific volume. Sometimes referred to as \"justification factors\" or corrections to extend the range of benefits of the ideal gas law for design purposes. Usually this Z value is very close to uniform. The compressibility factor figure depicts Z varying over a very cold temperature range. In fluid mechanics, the Reynolds number is the ratio of the inertial force (vs\u03c1) to the viscous force (\u03bc/L). It is one of the most important dimensionless numbers in fluid dynamics and is used, usually in conjunction with other dimensionless numbers, to provide criteria for determining dynamic similarity. Therefore, the Reynolds number provides a link between the modeling (design) results and the actual full-scale conditions. It can also be used to characterize flows.

If the gases have no viscosity, then they will not stick to the surface of the wing and form a boundary layer. A study of the delta wings in the Schlieren image shows that the gas particles stick to one another (see boundary layer section). In fluid dynamics, turbulence or turbulent flow is a region of flow characterized by stochastic, chaotic changes in properties. These include low momentum diffusion, high momentum convection, and very fast variations in pressure and velocity in space and time. Weather satellite imagery around the Robinson Crusoe Islands is described as one such example. Particles will, in effect, \"stick\" to the surface of objects moving past them. This layer of particles is called the boundary layer. On the surface of the object, it is basically static due to surface friction. The object, with its boundary layer is effectively a new shape of the object that the rest of the molecule \"sees\" as the object approaches. This boundary layer can separate from the surface, essentially creating a new surface and completely changing the flow path. A classic example of this is a dropped aerofoil. The delta wing image clearly shows boundary layer thickening as gas flows from right to left along the leading edge of the wing. As the number of degrees of freedom approaches infinity, the system will be found in the macrostate that corresponds to the highest number of multiplexes. To illustrate this principle, observe the skin temperature of a frozen metal ingot. Using a thermal image of skin temperature, note the temperature distribution over the surface.

Based on this legal basis, Kotawaringin district was formed which includes West Sampit kawedanan, East Sampit kawedanan, North Sampit kawedanan and Kotawaringin Swapraja. Along with the development of the region and the need to increase harmony in running regional government, it is necessary to increase the number of Level II Regions in Kalimantan, by dividing several old Level II Regions into several new Level II Regions and forming new Municipalities.",

In 2001, this city took place Ethnic riots between Madurese and Dayak tribes. During the riots, more than 400 people died and 40,000 people had to flee. Sampit as the capital city of East Kotawaringin Regency is one of the most important cities in Central Kalimantan Province. Apart from being economically a relatively advanced district, it is also because it is located in a strategic position. Judging from the regional map of Central Kalimantan, the city of Sampit was previously located in the middle and this made its position very strategic. For example, residents from Buntok want to go to Java Island, so it will be closer if they pass through the City of Sampit rather than having to go to the City of Banjarmasin. Likewise if from Palangkaraya, Kuala Pemburan, and Kasongan. So, this strategic position will increase the comparative advantage of the Sampit seaport owned by this area, especially it will attract the economy of the districts around the East Kotawaringin area. On May 1, 1859 the Dutch East Indies government opened a port in Sampit. Sampit City is located on the banks of the Sampit River (or Mentaya River).",

This is due to the difficult morphology of the river, sediments and river channels that are not maintained, charred deposits, and traces of pieces of wood. Until now, what many people still question is the origin of the word Sampit itself. The first version states that the first person to open the Sampit area was a person named Sampit who came from Bati-Bati, South Kalimantan around the early 1700s. As historical evidence, the tomb of \"Datu\" Sampit itself can be found around Basirih. \"Datu\" Sampit has two children namely Alm. \u201cDatu\u201d Djungkir and \u201cDatu\u201d Usup Lamak. The sacred grave of \"Datu\" Djungkir can be found on the banks of the Mentaya river in Baamang Tengah, Sampit with a headstone that reads Djungkir bin Sampit. While the grave of \"Datu\" Usup Lamak is in Basirih. According to other sources, the word Sampit comes from the Chinese language which means \"31\" (sam=3, it=1). It was called 31, because at that time those who came to this area were groups of 31 Chinese people who then made trade contacts and opened plantation businesses (Masdipura; 2003). The results of the plantation trade at that time were rattan, rubber and gambier. One of the rubber plantation areas that was quite large at that time was the area behind the current Golden and Kodim. The Bumi Kencana Treaty Agreement per 13 August 1787, Raja Banjar Sultan Batu surrendered Sampit and its conquered areas to the Dutch VOC. In 1795-1802 there was a fierce war between the Netherlands against England. This resulted in the relocation of the Sampit residents to the interior, to be precise to the City of Besi.",

The Koewardt pirate character finally died and was buried around Ujung Pandaran. Until now, his grave is considered sacred by the local community. After feeling safe, in 1836, the residents then moved to Seranau which was formerly called Banua Usang (now: Mentaya Seberang) where at that time Chinese traders also began to arrive and settle there. However, according to the belief of the Chinese community, that a city should be built facing the rising sun. Meanwhile, Seranau faces the setting sun, which according to Chinese hongsui calculations is considered unfavorable. Because of that, they built a new settlement opposite Seranau (now Sampit) facing the rising sun. Another version, according to local folk legend that is still alive today, that Sampit at that time was in the form of a kingdom called the Sungai Sampit Kingdom and was ruled by Raja Bungsu. The king had two sons each Lumuh Sampit (boy) and Lumuh Langgana (girl). It is said that the kingdom of Sungai Sampit was eventually destroyed due to a power struggle between the siblings. The location of the Sampit River kingdom is estimated to be around the present PT Indo Belambit company (Bagendang Hilir Village). Several years ago, the flagpole of the former royal ship made of large ironwood was still there and was buried in the mud under the wharf of PT Indo Belambit. Other evidence that corroborates this allegation, is that ceramic shards were also found at that location when a trench was excavated.

Some scholars argue that Sarah was the daughter of a man named Haran who was Abraham's/Ibrahim's uncle. In the history of the hadith, it is stated that Abraham never lied in his life, except on three occasions, one of which was when Abraham said that Sarah was his sister. In the Bible, the statement that Sarah was Abraham's sister comes from what Abraham said while in Egypt and to Abimelech. Regarding the explanation regarding the descendants of Terah in the Bible in the Book of Genesis chapter 11, information about Sarah's background is mentioned twice: the first time it says that Sarah (then called Sarai) was the wife of Abraham (then named Abram), the second time says that Sarah is daughter-in-law Terah and Abraham's wife. There is no record of her being Terah's daughter. There is no record in the Bible of Sarai before she left Mesopotamia. The Midras and Aggadah provide additional accounts of his life, along with his role in Judaism. It is stated that Sarai was born in Ur Chaldeans, Mesopotamia, during the reign of King Nimrod (Namrud). Islamic sources state that Sarai is one of those who believe in her husband, Ibrahim (Abram), who invites people to return to the way of Allah and leave idol worship. It is said that Nimrod used to have rations of food distributed among the inhabitants. But Abram did not get a ration because of his argument with Nimrod. To appease his family, he fills his bag with sand. When he came home and slept, Sarai opened the bag which turned out to be food.",

Some who went with Abram were Sarai, Terah (Abram's father), and Lot (Abram's nephew). They stopped at a place called Haran (which is often identified as Harran). Terah died there at the age of 205. After that, Abram's party continued on to Canaan. However, there was a severe famine there, so that Abram had to temporarily flee to Egypt. But when the courtiers noticed Sarai's beauty, they reported it to Pharaoh. The report made Pharaoh curious and interested so he ordered Sarai to be presented before him. Fearing that he would be killed if he found out he was her husband, Abram asked Sarai to pose as his sister. Sarai was then taken by Pharaoh and Abram was given a lot of wealth. But Pharaoh and his entire palace were then hit by a plague. Pharaoh then blamed Abram for admitting that Sarai was his sister. Then Sarai was returned to Abram. Although not listed in the Qur'an, several hadith reports discuss this incident. After Sarai was brought to the palace, the King tried to touch Sarai, but his hand suddenly became paralyzed. The king begged Sarai to pray to God to heal him and Sarai did. After his hand recovered, the King repeated his actions, but he was paralyzed more severely than before.

Ishmael was born when Abram was 86 years old. Some scholars, such as Ibn Kathir, also quote the Bible in their work regarding this story. God then changed Abram's name to Abraham and Sarai to Sarah. God promised Abraham to be the father of a number of great nations, bestow many descendants, and kings would emerge from his descendants. God also promised Abraham and his descendants to give the land of Canaan. This agreement was fulfilled through Isaac, even though God promised that Ishmael would become a great nation as well. As a sign of the covenant, God commanded all males in Abraham's family and household to be circumcised. The circumcision agreement (unlike other promises) had two sides and was conditional: if Abraham and his descendants fulfilled their promise, God would become their God and give them the land. Abraham, Ishmael, and all the males in Abraham's household were then circumcised. This circumcision agreement was made when Abraham was 99 years old. The practice of circumcision is still continued by Jews and Muslims. In the Bible it is stated that while Abraham was sitting at the door of his tent during the sweltering heat, three foreign guests came and Abraham prostrated themselves to them as a form of respect.

Hearing this, Sarah was stunned while patting her own face because she was surprised because she was an old barren woman, as well as Abraham who was amazed. The angels replied, \"We convey the good news to you properly, so do not be of those who despair.\" Abraham replied, \"No one despairs of the mercy of his Lord, except those who go astray.\" Abraham then moved to Gerar, and there again his wife was taken by the king of Gerar to be his wife, after Sarah claimed to be Abraham's sister. However, Abimelech was warned by God in a dream not to touch Sarah. When Abimelech criticized Abraham for this deception, Abraham justified himself by explaining that Sarah was the daughter of his father, but not of his mother. Soon after this incident, Sarah gave birth to a son, Isaac. God told Abraham to name him after Abraham laughed when he heard the angel's prophecy about the birth of his son.

Sarah said to Abraham, \"Throw out the servant girl and her child, because this servant's child will not be joint-heir with my son Isaac.\" Even though Abraham was annoyed by Sarah's words, God told Abraham to listen to Sarah's case. Abraham then asked to leave and Hagar carried the supplies and Ishmael on her shoulders until the wilderness.

Suffering is the basic element that forms the negative valence of affective phenomena. The opposite of suffering is pleasure or happiness. This suffering is often categorized as physical or mental. This can come in varying degrees of intensity, from mild to unbearable. The factors of duration and frequency of occurrence usually compound the intensity. Attitudes toward suffering can vary widely, by sufferer or other person, according to how much it is regarded as avoidable or unavoidable, useful or useless, appropriate or inappropriate. Suffering occurs in every living being in many ways, often dramatically. Consequently, many areas of human activity are concerned with some aspect of suffering. These aspects may include the nature of suffering, processes, origins and causes, meaning and meaning, related to personal, social, and cultural behavior, medication, management, and use. The word suffering is sometimes used in the narrow sense of physical pain, but more often it refers to mental pain, or more often it refers to pain in the broadest sense, i.e. to pleasure feelings, emotions or sensations. The word pain usually refers to physical pain, a synonym for suffering. The words pain and suffering are often used in the same sense but in different senses.

In particular, mental pain (or suffering) can be used in conjunction with physical pain (or suffering) to distinguish between two different categories of pain or suffering. First, the distinction is that it uses physical pain in a sense that usually includes not only the 'typical sensory experience of physical pain' but also other unpleasant bodily experiences including starvation, hunger, disturbances of the vestibular system, nausea, lack of sleep, and itching. The second difference is that physical or mental conditions should not be taken too literally: physical pain or suffering, as a matter of fact, occurs through the conscious mind and involves an emotional aspect, while mental pain or suffering occurs through the physical brain and, being emotions, involves an important aspect of physiology. The word discomfort, which some people use synonymously with suffering or pain in a broad sense, can be used to refer to the basic affective dimension of pain (the suffering aspect), usually in contrast to the sensory dimension, as for example in this sentence: \"pain discomfort.\" often, though not always, closely related to the intensity and unique quality of painful sensation.\" Some words that have definitions similar to suffering are sorrow, misery or misery, pain, discomfort, displeasure, disapproval.

John Stuart Mill improved and promoted the doctrine of hedonistic utilitarianism.

Another aspect worth mentioning here is that many utilitarians since Bentham have argued that moral status derives from its ability to feel pleasure and pain: therefore, moral agents must consider not only the interests of humans, but also those of (other) animals. .

Derived from a word in Ancient Egyptian pronounced p\u0259r\u0259\u02be\u014d which literally means \"big house\", this word in Ancient Egypt was originally used to refer to the Royal Palace. This word was only used to refer to the kings of Egypt metonymously since the New Kingdom era (starting from the 18th Dynasty, 1539\u20131292 BC). And in the 22nd Dynasty (c. 945\u2013730 BC) it was also adopted as an honorary epithet. The word \"pharaoh\" or \"pharaoh\" was never a formal title for the kings of Egypt at that time. The use of the word \"pharaoh\" as a generic name for all the kings of Egypt stems from its use in the Hebrew Bible, where in the Qur'an it is spelled \"pharaoh\". In official documents, the full title of king of Egypt consists of five names, each preceded by one of the following: Horus, Two Women, Horus Gold, King of Upper and Lower Egypt, and Son of Re. The last name is given at birth, while the other at coronation. In the Egyptian community, religion was central to everyday life. One of the roles of the Pharaoh was as a liaison between the Gods and humans. The pharaoh then represented the Gods in the role of civil and religious administrator. Pharaoh owned all the land in Egypt, enacted laws, collected taxes, and defended Egypt against invaders as the commander of an army.",

History can also refer to an academic field that uses narrative to examine and analyze the sequence of past events and objectively determine the patterns of cause and effect that shaped them. Historians sometimes debate the nature of history and its usefulness by discussing the study of historical science as an end in itself and as a way of providing \"views\" on contemporary problems. Stories common to a particular culture, but unsupported by outsiders (such as the stories surrounding King Arthur) are usually classified as cultural heritage or legend, because they do not support the \"interested inquiry\" required of the historical discipline.

History is defined as a record of general human society or human civilization that occurs in the character/characteristics of that society. Moh. Ali in his book Introduction to Indonesian History, emphasizes the notion of history as follows: Because the scope of history is very large, it needs a good classification to facilitate research. If some writers like H.G. Wells, Will Durant, and Ariel Durant write history in general terms, most historians have their own expertise and specialization. There are many ways to sort information in history, including: In sorting it out, attention must be paid to how it is written, such as looking at the temporal and spatial boundaries of the theme itself. If this is not explained, then historians may be trapped into the philosophy of other sciences, such as sociology. This is why Immanuel Kant, who is called the Father of Sociology, mocks history as the \"laying brick\" of sociological facts. Many people criticize historical science. These critics see history as something unscientific because it does not fulfill scientific factors, especially the \"can be seen or tried again\" factor, meaning that history is only seen as mere knowledge, not as science. In fact, this opinion cannot be accepted by common sense because it is impossible for history to be repeated no matter what, because history only happens once and for all. Despite such challenges, historical science continues to develop and demonstrate its existence at the scientific level.

Not all of these sources can be used for historical research, because it depends on the period to be researched or studied. Historical research also depends on historiography, or historical perspectives, which differ from one another. There are many reasons why people keep and maintain historical records, including: administrative reasons (for example: the need for censuses, tax records, and trade records), political reasons (to praise or criticize state leaders, politicians, or other important people), religious reasons, art, sporting achievements (eg Olympic records), genealogy, personal records (eg correspondence), and entertainment. But in writing history, these sources need to be sorted out. This method is called source criticism. Source criticism is divided into two kinds, namely external and internal. External criticism is the first criticism that must be made by a historian when he writes his work, especially if the historical source is in the form of objects. Namely by looking at the validation of the physical form of the work, starting from the shape, color and anything that can be seen physically. While internal criticism is criticism seen from the contents of the source, whether it can be accounted for or not. Interviews are also used as historical sources. However, it is also necessary for historians to act critically both in sorting out sources and translating them into digital or written form. In the past, research on history was limited to research on written records or narrated history. However, along with the increase in the number of professional academics and the formation of new branches of knowledge around the 19th and 20th centuries, new historical information also arose.

A new term, namely nonleka, was proposed. The term \"prehistory\" is used to group together the branch of knowledge that examines the period before the discovery of written historical records. In the 20th century, the separation between history and prehistory made research difficult. Historians at that time tried to examine more than the political history narratives they usually used. They try to research using new approaches, such as economic, social, and cultural historical approaches. Everything requires a variety of sources. On the other hand, prehistorians such as Vere Gordon Childe] use archeology to explain many important events in places that would normally fall under the purview of history (and not pure prehistory). Such divisions have also been criticized for ruling out some civilizations, such as those found in Sub-Saharan Africa and in the Americas before the arrival of Columbus. Finally, gradually over the last few decades, the separation between history and prehistory has been largely eliminated. Now, no one knows for sure when history began. In general, history is known as a science that studies everything that is known about the past of mankind (although there is almost no separation between history and prehistory, there is a new field of knowledge known as Big History). Now what sources can be used to find out about something that happened in the past (for example: narrative history, linguistics, genetics, etc.), are accepted as valid sources by most historians. Historiography is a science that examines and deciphers historical information based on belief systems and philosophies.

Notable historians who helped develop historical study methods include: Leopold von Ranke, Lewis Bernstein Namier, Geoffrey Rudolf Elton, G. M. Trevelyan, and A. J. P. Taylor. In the 1960s, historians began to abandon historical narratives that were nationalistic epics in favor of using more realistic chronological narratives. Historians from France introduced the quantitative historical method. This method uses large amounts of data and information to trace the lives of people in history. Historians from America, especially those who were inspired by the era of civil and human rights movements, try to include more ethnic, tribal, racial, and social and economic groups in their historical studies. In recent years, postmodernist scientists have seriously questioned the legitimacy and necessity of historical studies.

Pseudo-history is inextricably linked with historical revisionism. Works that draw controversial conclusions from new, speculative, or disputed historical evidence, especially in the national, political, military, and religious fields, are often rejected as pseudo-history. A major intellectual battle took place in Britain in the early 20th century over the position of teaching history in universities. At Oxford and Cambridge, historical scholarship was neglected. Charles Harding Firth, Regius Professor of history at Oxford in 1904 derided this system because it produced only shallow journalists at best. Oxford teachers, who have more say than professors, defended it by stating that this system succeeded in producing prominent British statesmen, administrators, bishops, and diplomats. Moreover, their mission was as rewarding as training scholars. Teachers dominated the debate until after World War II. This system forced aspiring young scholars to teach in remote schools, such as at the University of Manchester, where Thomas Frederick Tout professionalized the undergraduate history program by introducing original source studies and the requirement to write a thesis.

After 1980, attention in the US increasingly shifted toward teaching world history or requiring students to take courses on non-Western cultures, to prepare them for life in a global economy. At the university level, historians debate the issue of whether history is more a social science or a humanities. Many see history as going into both. In Indonesia, most history programs are grouped under the humanities faculties. The teaching of history in French schools was influenced by Nouvelle histoire, which was published after 1960 by Cahiers pedagogiques and Enseignement and other journals for teachers. The Institut national de recherche et de documentation p\u00e9dagogique (INRDP), is also influential in teaching history.

The usual sacrifice was an animal, such as a sheep or buffalo, and was often cooked and eaten by the offeringr, with some being given to the Kohanim and some being burned on the altar (altar). Fruits, incense and cereals can also be offered. In Hebrew the noun sacrifice (or sacrifice) is used to refer to the various offerings commanded in the Hebrew Bible. The most common traditional usages are \"animal sacrifice\" (zevah \u05d6\u05b6\u05d1\u05b7\u05d7), or \"peace offering\", and \"burnt offering\" (olah). Such offerings were usually made by the Priests (Kohen) at the Temple in Jerusalem. This practice continued until Solomon's Temple was destroyed, then resumed when the Second Temple was built, and then ended when that temple itself was destroyed in AD 70. It was unofficially resumed during the Jewish-Roman Wars in the 2nd century AD, and later in certain communities. Rabbinic Judaism maintains that the Torah permits the observance of Jewish law without animal sacrifice based on oral tradition and strong support from Scripture, for example Psalm 51:16-19 and Hosea 6:6. However, the practice and nature of sacrifice continue to have relevance in the 613 mitzvot, Judaic theology and halakha (Jewish laws), especially in Orthodox Judaism.

The associated form of sacrifice appears only in the Book of Nehemiah (Nehemiah 10:35 and Nehemiah 13:31 \"wood offering\").

Zero variance indicates that all values \u200b\u200bare equal. The variance is always non-negative: a low variance indicates that the data points are skewed very close to the mean (expected value) and between each other, while a high variance indicates that the data points are widely spread around the mean and from each other. The same measurement, namely the square root of the variance, is also called the standard deviation. The standard deviation has the same dimensions and data, and therefore can be compared with the deviation from the mean. Variance is one of the descriptors of a probability distribution. In particular, variance is one of the moments of a distribution. In that context, it forms part of the systematic approach to differentiating between probability distributions. Although other approaches have been developed, moment-based ones are more advantageous in mathematical ease and calculation. Variance is a parameter that describes, among other things, the actual probability distribution of a population of observed numbers, or the theoretical probability distribution of a population that is not fully observed from which a sample number is taken. In the latter case, a sample of data from the distribution can be used to form an estimate of the variance of the underlying distribution; in simple cases this estimate may be the sample variance. The term variance was first introduced by Ronald Fisher in his 1918 paper entitled The Correlation Between Relatives on the Supposition of Mendelian Inheritance (\"Correlation Between Relatives in the Framework of Mendelian Inheritance\").

Usually most Maoists consider Joseph Stalin to be the last true socialist leader of the Soviet Union. In contrast to earlier forms of Marxism-Leninism, in which the urban proletariat was considered the main source of revolution, and the rural areas were generally ignored, Mao focused on the peasantry as the main revolutionary force, which, he argued, could be led by the proletariat and its bodyguard, the CCP. The model for this was the protracted people's war waged by the Chinese communists in the countryside in the 1920s and 1930s, which eventually brought the CCP to power. Furthermore, in contrast to other forms of Marxism-Leninism where massive industrial development was seen as a positive force, Maoism made overall rural development its priority. Mao felt that this strategy made sense during the early stages of socialism in a country where most of the people were agricultural labourers. In contrast to most other political ideologies, including socialist and Marxist ideologies, Maoism contains an integral military doctrine and clearly links its political ideology to military strategy.

To date no clear supersolid state of helium-4 has been observed. At temperatures below 2.176 K helium-4 enters a superfluid state and flows without friction. This \"perpetual motion\" makes superfluidity - perhaps even more so than its electronics, superconductivity - the most dramatic manifestation of quantum mechanics on a macrocosmic scale. Despite its attractiveness, despite the abundance of superfluidity liquefaction in other systems, it remains an uncommon phenomenon. From 1938, when superfluidity was discovered, helium-4 was the only known example until 1972 when the phenomenon was seen, at much lower temperatures, in helium-3. The temperature difference between the behavior of the two isotopes reflects the close relationship between superfluidity and Bose-Einstein condensation - the transition that occurs when 'bosons' collect in a single quantum mechanical state. The helium-4 atom is a boson, but the helium-4 atom is a fermion and must pair before it can condense into a single state.",

        "paragraph": "Editor page logged out learn more Syphilis or lion king disease is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the spirochete bacterium Treponema pallidum sub-species pallidum. The main route of transmission is through sexual contact; This infection can also be passed from mother to fetus during pregnancy or at birth, causing congenital syphilis. Other human diseases caused by Treponema pallidum include yaws or patek (subspecies pertenue), pinta (sub-species carateum), and bejel (sub-species endemicum). Signs and symptoms of syphilis vary depending on which phase the disease occurs (primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary). The primary phase is generally characterized by the appearance of a single chancre (hard, painless, non-itchy skin ulceration), secondary syphilis is characterized by a diffuse rash that often appears on the palms and soles of the feet, latent syphilis usually has no or only few symptoms, and tertiary syphilis with gumma, neurological, or cardiac symptoms. However, this disease has been known as the \"great imitator\" because its appearance is characterized by dissimilar symptoms. Diagnosis is usually made through a blood test; however, bacteria can also be seen through a microscope. Syphilis can be treated effectively with antibiotics, especially penicillin G (which is injected for neurosyphilis), or ceftriaxone, and for patients who have a severe allergy to penicillin, doxycycline or azithromycin can be given orally. Syphilis is believed to have infected 12 million people worldwide in 1999, with more than 90% of cases occurring in developing countries. After case numbers declined dramatically since the worldwide availability of penicillin in the 1940s, infection rates have been increasing since the turn of the millennium in many countries, sometimes coexisting with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).",

Syphilis can appear in one of four different phases; primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary, and can also occur congenitally. This phase was called the \"great imitator\" by Sir William Osler because of its varied appearance. Primary syphilis is generally acquired from direct sexual contact with an infected person to another person. About 3 to 90 days after the initial infection (average 21 days) a sore on the skin called a chancre appears. These lesions are usually (40 % of the time) single, firm, painless, non-itchy skin ulcers with a clean base and sharp edges between 0.3 and 3.0 cm in size. However, wounds can be removed in almost any form. In the common form, sores progress from macules to papules and finally to erosions or ulcers. Occasionally, multiple lesions may appear (~40%). Multiple lesions are more common when co-infected with HIV. The lesions may be painful or sore (30%), and may occur outside the genitals (2\u20137%). The most common sites in women are the cervix (44%), the penis in heterosexual men (99%), and the anal and rectal relatively common (men who have sex with men) (34%). Enlarged lymph nodes (80%) often occur around the site of infection, occurring within 10 days of ulcer formation. The lesions can persist for three to six weeks without treatment. Secondary syphilis often occurs four to ten weeks after the primary infection. While secondary disease can be recognized in a number of distinct ways, the most common symptoms are associated with the skin, mucous membranes, and lymph nodes.",

It can form flat, wide, whitish, wart-like lesions known as condyloma broad on the mucous membranes. All of the lesional bacterial deposits were infected. Other symptoms include fever, sore throat, malaise, weight loss, hair loss and headache. Other types of disease that occur less frequently include hepatitis, kidney disease, arthritis, periostitis, optic neuritis, uveitis, and interstitial keratitis. Acute symptoms usually resolve after three to six weeks; however, about 25% of people may relapse secondary symptoms. Many people who have secondary syphilis (40-85% of women, 20-65% of men) do not report having previously had a chancre from primary syphilis. Latent syphilis is defined as having serological evidence of infection without symptoms of disease. The disease is further described as early (less than 1 year after secondary syphilis) or late (more than 1 year after secondary syphilis) in the United States. The United States uses the cut of two years of early and late latent syphilis. Early latent syphilis may have relapses of symptoms. Late latent syphilis is asymptomatic, and not as contagious as early latent syphilis. Tertiary syphilis can occur approximately 3 to 15 years after the initial infection, and can be divided into three distinct forms; gummatous syphilis (15%), late neurosyphilis (6.5%), and cardiovascular syphilis (10%). Without treatment, all three of those infected progressed to tertiary disease. People with tertiary syphilis are not contagious.

Neurosyphilis refers to an infection involving the central nervous system that may occur early, become asymptomatic or in the form of syphilistic meningitis associated with impaired balance and flash pains in the lower extremities. Late neurosyphilis generally occurs 4 to 25 years after the initial infection. Meningovascular syphilis commonly presents with apathy and convulsions, and has been common with dementia and dorsalis. Also there may be Argyll Robertson's pupils, where the small bilateral pupils constrict when people focus on close objects, but do not constrict when exposed to bright light. Cardiovascular syphilis usually occurs 10-30 years after the initial infection. The most common complication is syphilitic aortitis, which can result in the formation of an aneurysm. Congenital congenital syphilis from birth can occur during pregnancy or during birth. Two out of three syphilis babies are born without symptoms. Common symptoms that later develop over the first few years of life include: hepatosplenomegaly (70%), rash (70%), fever (40%), neurosyphilis (20%), and pneumonitis (20%).

That's because its small genome (1.14 mDa) fails to encode the metabolic pathways needed to make most of its macronutrients. Its micronutrient production is twice as slow, much longer than 30 hours. Syphilis is mainly transmitted by sexual contact or during pregnancy from mother to fetus; spirochaetes are able to penetrate intact mucous membranes or skin disorders. It can therefore be transmitted by kissing areas near the lesions, as well as oral, vaginal, and anal sex. About 30 to 60% of those with primary or secondary syphilis will develop the disease. As an example of transmission, a person injected with only 57 organisms has a 50% chance of being infected. Most (60%) of new cases in the United States occur in men who have sex with men. The disease can be transmitted through blood products. However, blood products have been tested in many countries and the risk of transmission is low. The risk of transmission from sharing needles is not much. Syphilis cannot be transmitted through toilet seats, daily activities, hot tubs, or sharing cutlery or clothing. The initial appearance of syphilis is difficult to diagnose clinically. The diagnosis is made through a blood test or direct visual examination using a microscope. Blood tests are a commonly used method, because they are easier to do. Diagnostic tests, however, are unable to differentiate between the stages of the disease. Blood tests are divided into nontreponemal and treponemal tests. Nontreponemal tests were used initially, and included laboratory venereal disease research (VDRL) and rapid plasma reagin tests. However, as these tests are only occasionally false positives, confirmation is required by means of a treponemal test, such as treponemal pallidum particle agglutination (TPHA) or fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test (FTA-Abs).",

Neurosyphilis is diagnosed by finding high numbers of leukocytes (especially lymphocytes) and high levels of protein in the spinal fluid a condition of a known syphilitic infection. Dark-field microscopy of the serous fluid from an ulcer can be used to make a direct diagnosis. However, hospitals do not always have the equipment or experienced staff members, while testing has to be done within 10 minutes of sample acquisition. Sensitivity has been reported to be nearly 80%, sensitivity and specificity can only be used to confirm the diagnosis but are not the only rule. Two other tests can be performed on the sample from the cup: the direct fluorescent antibody test and the nucleic acid amplification test. Direct fluorescent tests use antibodies tagged with fluorescein, which are inserted for specific syphilis proteins, whereas nucleic acid amplification uses techniques, such as the polymerase chain reaction, to detect the presence of a specific syphilis gene. The tests are unlike time-sensitive, as they do not need live bacteria to make a diagnosis. There is no effective vaccine for prevention. Abstaining from intimate physical contact with an infected person effectively reduces transmission of syphilis, as does the proper use of latex condoms. However, the use of condoms, does not completely eliminate the risk. Therefore, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends long-term relationships with one uninfected partner and avoiding substances such as alcohol and other illicit substances that can increase risky sexual behavior.

If they are positive, they recommend that their partners also be treated. Despite this, congenital syphilis is still common in developing countries, as many women have not received any antenatal care at all, and even other prenatal care received does not include screening, and this still occurs occasionally in developed countries, because they are the most likely to be infected. syphilis (through drug use, etc.) is the least likely to receive treatment during pregnancy. Several measures to increase access to testing appear to be effective in reducing rates of congenital syphilis in low- to middle-income countries. Syphilis is a notifiable disease in several countries, including Canada, the European Union, and the United States. This means healthcare providers are required to notify Public Health authorities, who will ideally then provide spousal notification to the patient's partner. The doctor may also encourage the patient to send the patient's partner to seek health care. The CDC recommends that sexually active men who have sex with men get tested at least once a year. The first treatment option for complicated syphilis remains a single intramuscular dose of penicillin G or an oral dose of azithromycin. Doxycycline and tetracycline are other options; however, because of the risk of fetal abnormalities, docycline and tetracycline are not recommended for pregnant women. Resistance to antibiotics has developed for a number of agents, including macrolides, clindamycin, and rifampin.

For neurosyphilis, due to poor penetration of penicillin G into the central nervous system, those affected are recommended to receive high-dose intravenous penicillin for at least 10 days. If the person is allergic, ceftriaxone can be used or penicillin desensitization can be tried. Other late episodes may be treated with intramuscular penicillin G once weekly for three weeks. If allergic, as in early cases, doxycycline or tetracycline can be used, even for a longer period of time. Treatment in this phase limits further development, but has relatively little effect on the damage that has already occurred. One side effect that can occur from this medication is the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. The Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction often begins after an hour and persists for 24 hours, with fever, muscle aches, headache, and tachycardia. Tachycardia is caused by cytokines released by the immune system in response to lipoproteins secreted from the ruptured syphilis bacteria.

Syphilis rates among American women, however, remained stable during this period, and rates among British women increased, but were still below the rates for men. Increasing numbers among heterosexuals have occurred in China and Russia since the 1990s. This is associated with unsafe sex practices, such as multiple sex partners, prostitution, and decreased use of protection. If left untreated, the mortality rate is 8% to 58%, with males having a higher mortality rate. The severity of syphilis symptoms decreased during the 19th and 20th centuries, partly because of the increasing availability of effective treatments and because of the decrease in the virulence of the spirochaetes.

These are referred to as the \"Columbian\" and \"pre-Columbian\" hypotheses, respectively. The Columbus hypothesis is strongly supported by the available evidence. Written records of an extraordinary occurrence of syphilis in Europe date back to 1494/1495 in Naples, Italy, during the French invasion. Because it was spread by returning French troops, it was originally called \"French disease\", its traditional name. In 1530, the name \"syphilis\" was first used by the Italian physician and poet Girolamo Fracastoro as the title of a Latin poem in dactylic hexameter describing the ravages of syphilis in Italy. In history this event is also known as the \"Great Pox\". The causative organism, Treponema pallidum, was first identified by Fritz Schaudinn and Erich Hoffmann in 1905. The first effective treatment (Salvarsan) was developed in 1910 by Paul Ehrlich, which was followed by trials of penicillin and confirmation of its effectiveness in 1943. Prior to the discovery of other effective treatments, mercury and isolation was widely used, with worse treatment of the disease.

The research began in 1932, when syphilis was a widespread problem and there was no safe or effective treatment. The study was designed to measure the progression of untreated syphilis. In 1947, penicillin was validated as an effective drug for syphilis and was used widely to treat the disease. The study director, however, continued the study and did not offer the study participants treatment with penicillin. This is disputed, and some people know that penicillin was given to many subjects. The study did not end until 1972. A syphilis experiment was also conducted in Guatemala from 1946 to 1948. The experiment was sponsored by the United States human experimenter, conducted during the reign of Juan Jos\u00e9 Ar\u00e9valo in collaboration with Guatemala's ministry and health officials.

The spatial layout of the three cities is included in the National Spatial Plan (Perpres 45/2011). The name Denpasar comes from the words \"den\" (north) and \"pasar\" so that as a whole it means \"North Market\". The origin of this word indicates the city's origin as a market town, in what is now Pasar Kumbasari (formerly \"Peken Payuk\"), in the northern part of the modern city. Denpasar was originally a park. This park was not like other parks in general, because it was the favorite garden of the King of Badung at that time, Kyai Jambe Ksatrya. At that time, Kyai Jambe Ksatrya lived in Puri Jambe Ksatrya, which is now Pasar Satria. This park is unique, because it is equipped with a place to play cockfighting (tajen). Kyai Jambe Ksatrya's hobby was playing cockfighting, therefore it was not uncommon for the king to invite other kings in Bali to play cockfighting in the park. Previously this area was part of the Badung Kingdom, a Hindu Majapahit Kingdom that existed from the 18th to 19th centuries, before the kingdom was subdued by the Dutch on September 20, 1906, in a heroic event known as the Puputan Badung War.",

Despite features that indicate a fairly strong role for Tethys in very ancient times, she is not mentioned much in ancient Greek texts, or historical records of ancient cults. Walter Burkert notes the presence of Tethys in the episode of Iliad XIV that the Ancients called the \"Deception of Zeus\", where Hera, to mislead Zeus, says she wants to go to Oceanus, \"origin of the gods\" and Tethys \"the mother\". Burkert sees in the name a transformation from Akkadian tiamtu or t\u00e2mtu, \"sea,\" which is recognizable in Tiamat. Alternatively, her name may simply mean \"old woman\"; it bears obvious resemblance to \u1f21 \u03c4\u03ae\u03b8\u03b7, meaning \"grandmother\", and she is often described as a very ancient goddess. One of the few depictions of Tethis is a floor mosaic from the fourth century AD in Antiochus, and now in Harvard Business School in Boston, Massachusetts having previously transferred from Dumbarton Oaks. In the Dumbarton Oaks mosaic, Tethis's head, surrounded by fish, emerges from the water. On his shoulder is a ship's rudder, on his forehead are a pair of gray wings. Tethis is the child of Uranus and Gaia. Tethis appears in classical poetry but is not worshiped. Tethis is the sister and wife of Oceanus. Tethis is the mother of the world's rivers eg Nile, Alfios, Maiander. Tethis also had three thousand daughters who were called Oceanids. Considered to be the embodiment of water in the world, Tethis is also said to be related to Thalassa, the embodiment of the sea. In Titanomakhia, Tethis raises Hera as her stepson.

As such, it is one of the four basic states of matter (the others being solid, gas, and plasma), and is the only state with a definite volume but no fixed shape. Liquids consist of particles of matter with fine vibrations, such as atoms, held together by intermolecular forces. Water is, by far, the most common liquid on Earth. Like gases, liquids can flow and take the shape of their container. Most liquids are incompressible, although others are compressible. Unlike gases, liquids do not spread to fill every space of the container, and maintain a fairly constant density. A characteristic property of the liquid state is surface tension, which leads to the wetting phenomenon. The density of liquids is usually close to that of solids, and much higher than that of gases. Therefore, liquid and solid are both called condensed matter. On the other hand, since liquids and gases share the ability to flow, they are both called fluids. Although water is abundant on Earth, this state of matter is actually the least common in the known universe, because the existence of liquid requires a relatively narrow temperature/pressure range. Most known matter in the universe exists in the gaseous state (with detectable traces of dense matter) as interstellar clouds or in the plasma form within stars. Liquid is one of the four main states of matter, along with solid, gas and plasma. Fluid is fluid. Unlike solids, molecules in liquids have much greater freedom of movement.",

Liquids, like gases, display fluid properties. Liquids can flow, imagine the shape of a container, and if placed in a closed container, will distribute pressure evenly over every surface of the container. If the liquid is placed in the bag, it can be pressed into any shape. Unlike gases, liquids are nearly incompressible. It has a nearly constant volume over a wide pressure range; it does not expand to fill the empty space in a container but forms its own surface, and does not always mix easily with other liquids. This property makes the fluid suitable for applications such as hydraulics. The liquid particles are held together tightly but not rigidly. They are able to move freely, resulting in a limited degree of particle mobility. As the temperature increases, the molecular vibrations increase causing the distance between molecules to increase. When the liquid reaches its boiling point, the cohesive forces holding the molecules together are broken, and the liquid turns into a gas (unless superheating occurs). If the temperature drops, the distance between the molecules gets closer and closer. When a liquid reaches its freezing point, the molecules usually lock together into a specific order, which is called crystallization, and the bonds between them become more rigid, turning the liquid into its solid state (unless supercooling occurs). There are only two elements that are liquids at standard temperature and pressure: mercury and bromine. Four other elements have melting points just above room temperature: francium, cesium, gallium and rubidium.

Not all gases can be liquefied at atmospheric pressure, for example carbon dioxide can only be liquefied at pressures above 5.1 atm. Some matter cannot be classified under the three classical forms of matter; they have solid-like and liquid-like properties. Examples include liquid crystals, which are used in LCD screens, and biological membranes. Liquids have a variety of uses, as lubricants, solvents, and coolants. In a hydraulic system, fluids act as power conductors. In tribology, fluids are studied for their properties as lubricants. Lubricants such as oil are selected for their viscosity and flow characteristics which are suitable for the entire operating temperature range of the components. Oils are frequently used in engines, gearboxes, metal works, and hydraulic systems because of their good lubricating properties. Many liquids are used as solvents, to dissolve other solids or liquids. Solutions are widely used for a variety of applications, including paints, sealants, and glues.

The volume of a liquid is a function of temperature and pressure. Liquids usually expand when heated, and contract when cooled. Water at temperatures between 0\u00b0C and 4\u00b0C is an exception. Liquids have little compressibility. Water, for example, only 46.4 parts per million will be compressed for every unit increase in atmospheric pressure (bar). At a pressure of about 4,000 bar (58,000 psi), at room temperature, water only loses 11% in volume. In the study of fluid dynamics, fluids are often treated as incompressible, especially when studying incompressible flow en]. The incompressibility makes fluids suitable for transmitting hydraulic power, since very little energy is lost in compression. However, the very small compressibility does cause other phenomena. The impact on the pipe, called a water hammer, occurs when the valve suddenly closes, creating an enormous pressure spike in the valve that travels backwards through slightly below the speed of sound. Another phenomenon caused by the incompressibility of liquids is cavitation. Because liquids have little elasticity, they can actually be pulled apart in areas of high turbulence or dramatic changes in direction, such as the trailing edge of a boat propeller or sharp corners in a pipe. The liquid in the area of \u200b\u200blow pressure (vacuum) evaporates and forms bubbles, which then collapse as they enter the area of \u200b\u200bhigh pressure.

This pressure is transmitted in all directions and increases with depth. If the fluid is at rest in a uniform gravitational field, the pressure, p, at any depth, z, is given by: Note that this formula assumes that the pressure on the free surface is zero, and the effects of surface tension are negligible. Objects immersed in a liquid are subject to the phenomenon of buoyancy. (Buoyancy is also observed in other fluids, but is especially strong in liquids because of their high density.) The surface of the liquid, where surface tension appears, behaves like an elastic membrane, allowing the formation of droplets and bubbles. Surface waves, capillary action, wetting, and ripples are other consequences of surface tension. In confined liquids, which are defined on the basis of geometric constraints at the nanoscopic scale, most molecules experience some surface effects, which can result in physical properties that greatly diverge from those of the bulk liquid. A free surface is a fluid surface that is subjected to zero pressure either perpendicular to the normal or parallel to the shear, such as the boundary between, for example, water and air in the Earth's atmosphere. The liquid level (as in, for example, the water level) is the height of the free surface of the liquid, specifically the uppermost surface. The liquid level can be measured using a level sensor. Viscosity measures the resistance of a liquid to deformation due to shear stress and external pressure. In other words, viscosity is a fluid's resistance to flow. When a liquid is supercooled towards the glass transition, its viscosity increases dramatically. The liquid then becomes a viscoelastic medium which exhibits elasticity like a solid as well as fluidity like a liquid, depending on the observation time scale or perturbation frequency.",

In fresh water, c = 1497 m/s at 25 \u00b0C At temperatures below the boiling point, any matter in liquid form will evaporate until the condensation of the gas above it reaches equilibrium. At this point, the gas will condense at the same rate as the liquid evaporates. So, the liquid cannot continue to exist if the evaporating liquid is continuously removed. Liquids at their boiling point will evaporate faster than their gas condenses at the prevailing pressure. Liquids at or above their boiling point will normally boil, although superheating can prevent this in certain situations. At temperatures below its freezing point, liquids tend to crystallize, turning into solids. Unlike the transition to gas, there is no equilibrium in this transition under constant pressure, so the liquid will eventually completely crystallize unless supercooling occurs. It should be noted that this is only true under constant pressure, so suppose that water and ice in a tightly closed, strong container could achieve equilibrium in the two phases coexisting. For the reverse transition from solid to liquid, see liquefaction. The phase diagram explains why liquids do not exist in space or any other vacuum medium. Because the pressure is zero (except on the surface or interior of planets and moons), water and other liquids exposed to space will quickly boil or freeze depending on their temperature.

If it is slightly viscous, it will flow not far from the source and form a lava dome and at the edges freeze to form lava blocks whose temperature is still high. If the position is unstable, it will flow to form hot clouds of lava fallout. The composition of almost all lava from the Earth's crust is dominated by silicate minerals: feldspar, olivine, pyroxene, amphibole, mica, and quartz. In general, the composition of lava determines its properties more than the temperature at which it erupts. The viscosity of the lava is also very influential in its movement. Very viscous lavas include rhyolite, dacite, andesite, and trasite. Cold basalt lava is also quite viscous. Watery lava includes recently erupted basalt, carbonate lava, and sometimes andesite.

For example, a photon is a single quantum of light (or some other form of electromagnetic radiation). Similarly, the bond energies of electrons in atoms are quantized and exist only in certain discrete values.

Quantization is one of the foundations of the broader quantum mechanical physics. The quantization of energy and its effect on the way energy and matter interact (quantum electrodynamics) is part of the basic framework for understanding and describing nature. The word quantum comes from the Latin quantus, which means \"how great\". \"Quanta\" was used in a 1902 journal article on the photoelectric effect by Philipp Lenard, who quoted Hermann von Helmholtz for using the word in electricity. However, the word quantum was generally known before 1900. The word is often used in medicine, as in the term quantum satis. Both Helmholtz and Julius von Mayer were doctors and physicists. Helmholtz used quantum with reference to heat energy in his article on Mayer's work, and the word quantum can be found in Mayer's formulation of the first law of thermodynamics in his paper dated July 24, 1841.

International NGOs can gain consultative status in ECOSOC and other bodies to participate in the United Nations. The General Assembly is the main deliberative assembly of the United Nations. Comprised of all UN member states, the assembly meets annually under a chairperson elected from among the member states. During a two-week period at the start of each session, all members have the opportunity to address the assembly. Usually the Secretary General makes the speech first, followed by the chairman of the council. The first session was held on 10 January 1946 at Westminster Central Hall in London, and was attended by representatives from 51 countries. When the General Assembly holds elections on important matters, a minimum of two-thirds of the votes of all the members present is required. Examples of these important issues include: recommendations on peace and security; election of members to UN bodies; admission, suspension, and expulsion of members; and budget stuff. While other matters are determined sufficiently by a majority vote. Each member state has one vote. Apart from matters of budget approval, resolutions are not binding on members. The Assembly can make recommendations on any issue within the scope of the United Nations, except for peace and security issues which are under the consideration of the Security Council. Conceivably, with a one-country-one-vote structure it could happen that countries representing only eight percent of the population were able to pass resolutions with a two-thirds vote (see List of countries by population).",

The Security Council is tasked with maintaining peace and security between countries. While other UN bodies can only make 'recommendations' to member governments, the Security Council has the power to make binding decisions that member governments have agreed to implement, according to the provisions of Charter Article 25. The Council's decisions are known as UN Security Council Resolutions. . The Security Council is made up of 15 member states, of which 5 permanent members\u2014China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States\u2014and 10 non-permanent members, currently, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Colombia, Gabon, Japan, Germany, India, Lebanon, Nigeria, Portugal and South Africa.

The ten provisional seats are held for a two-year term with member countries elected by the General Assembly on a regional basis. The President of the Security Council rotates alphabetically each month. The UN Secretariat is headed by a UN Secretary-General, assisted by a staff of international civil servants from around the world. The main task of a Secretary-General is to provide research, information and facilities required by UN agencies for their meetings. He also carries out tasks as directed by the United Nations Security Council, the United Nations General Assembly, the United Nations Economic and Social Council, and other United Nations agencies.

Key secretariat offices in this area include the Office of the Coordinator for Humanitarian Affairs, and the Department of Peacekeeping Operations. The Secretary-General may bring to the attention of the Security Council any matter which, in his opinion, could threaten international peace and security.

The United Nations, after approval by the Security Council, sends peacekeepers to areas where armed conflict has recently ceased or paused to enforce the terms of the peace agreement, and to prevent fighters from both sides from resuming hostilities.

Under the rule of Russia and the Soviet Union, ethnic and tribal divisions between the Circassians (and other peoples) were promoted, resulting in several statistically different names being used for different parts of the Circassians (Adyghes, Cherkess, Kabardins, Shapsugs). Consequently, there was an attempt by the Circassians to unite under the name Circassian (Adyghe) in the Russian Census to reflect and revive the concept of the Circassian nation. The majority of the diaspora is already inclined to call itself \"Circassian\". Most of the population was expelled from their country in the late 19th century after the Russo-Circassian War in what amounted to the Circassian ethnic cleansing. Today, Circassians are found in various areas of the old Ottoman Empire and its neighboring countries, including Turkey, Jordan, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Kosovo, Egypt and Israel (in the villages of Kfar Kama and Rehaniya, since 1880), and even as far away as such as New Jersey and California in the United States, Germany, Australia and the Netherlands.",

In a fascist mindset, the enemy is everywhere, both on the battlefield and within the nation itself as an element that is inconsistent with fascist ideology. In fascist ideology, human individuality is lost and followers become a uniform mass where individuals are only a tool to achieve goals of the fascist movement.

Individuality is lost because diversity is prohibited, the destruction of individual identity results in floating masses led by charismatic leaders with absolute power. In a fascist state, the capitalist economic structure usually operates by placing humans as a tool for the country's development. Political elites and economic elites work together and the ideology of the ultra-nationalist nation makes ordinary citizens not aware of or do not care about the political-economic hierarchy. They advocate the formation of a single party totalitarian state that seeks to mobilize the masses of a nation and the creation of an ideal \"new man\" to form a ruling elite through indoctrination, physical education, and including family policy eugenics.

Scholars generally consider fascism to be on the far right. Fascism exalts violence, war, and militarism as means of bringing about positive changes in society, in providing spiritual renovation, education, instilling a will to dominate in the character of people, and creating national brotherhood through military service. Violent fascists see war as an act that creates regeneration of spirit, nationalism and vitality. Fascism is anti-communist, anti-democratic, anti-individualist, anti-liberal, anti-parliamentary, anti-conservative, anti-bourgeois, anti-proletarian and anti-capitalist. In many cases, Fascism rejects the concepts of egalitarianism, materialism, and rationalism in favor of action, discipline, hierarchy, passion, and will. In economics, fascism opposes liberalism (as a bourgeois movement) and Marxism (as a proletarian movement) to become an exclusive class-based economy of the Fascist movement. Their ideology is like that carried out by the trans-class economic movement which promotes the resolution of economic class conflicts to secure national solidarity. They support an integrated and multi-class regulated national economic system. Fascismo is a term derived from the Latin word \"fasses\" (Roman spelling: fasces). Fasses, consisting of a bunch of sticks tied around an axe, was a symbol of the authority of the ancient Roman civil magistrate, and also meant glory. They were carried by the lictors and could be used for corporal and capital punishment at His command. The word fascismo is also related to the political organizations in Italy known as fasci, groups similar to trade unions or syndicates. The symbolism of the fasces suggests strength through unity: a single rod is easily broken, whereas a bundle is difficult to split. Similar symbols were developed by different fascist movements.",

Since the 1990s, scholars including Stanley Payne, Roger Eatwell, Roger Griffin and Robert O. Paxton have amassed a rough consensus on the core principles of ideology. For Griffin, fascism is \"a truly revolutionary, trans-class form of antiliberal, and in the last analysis, anticonservative nationalism\" built on a complex range of theoretical and cultural influences. He distinguished the inter-war period which manifested in elite-led but populist \"armed party\" politics opposed to socialism and liberalism and the radical politics that promised to save the nation from decadence. Paxton saw fascism as \"an obsessive preoccupation with society's decline, humiliation or victimhood and with compensatory cults of unity, energy and purity\". In Paxton's interpretation, fascists are \"committed nationalist militant\", working restlessly alongside traditional elites and abandoning democratic liberties in pursuit of \"internal cleansing\" or territorial expansion. One common definition of fascism focuses on three groups of ideas: fascist negations which are antiliberalism, anticommunism and anticonservatism, nationalist, authoritarian aims to create regulated economic structures to change social relations in modern, self-determined cultures, political aesthetics using romantic symbolism, mass mobilization , a positive view of violence, promotion of masculinity and youth and charismatic leadership or fascism as a system of philosophy.

A key element in the creation of fascism was the fusion of the nationalist agenda on the political right by the Sorelian Syndicalists on the left, around the outbreak of World War I. Sorelian Syndicalism, unlike other ideologies on the left, held an elitist view that the morality of the working class should be elevated. The Sorelian concept of the positive nature of social war and the insistence on moral revolution led some syndicalists to believe that war is the ultimate manifestation of social change and moral revolution. The Nationalist and military influences which had begun to combine with Syndicalism since 1907 created divisions in the political left. This split was strong in Italy, where nationalists and syndicalists increasingly influenced one another's nationalism.

The frenulum of the penis can also be excised simultaneously in a procedure called a frenectomy. The word circumcision comes from the Latin circum (meaning \"to twist\") and caedere (meaning \"to cut\"). Circumcision has been practiced since prehistoric times, observed from cave drawings dating from the Stone Age and ancient Egyptian tombs. The reasons for this act were unclear at the time but theories suggest that it was part of a ritual sacrifice or offering, a sign of submission to the Almighty, a step toward adulthood, a sign of defeat or slavery, or an attempt to change aesthetics or sexuality. Male circumcision is obligatory in Islam and Judaism. This practice is also present among the majority of the population of South Korea, America, and the Philippines. In 2012, the AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS released their study of experts showing that the health benefits of newborn male circumcision outweigh the risks. Specific benefits of male circumcision include prevention of urinary tract infections, HIV transmission, transmission of some sexually transmitted infections, and penile cancer. Circumcision in boys does not affect penile sexual function/sensitivity or sexual satisfaction.

No major medical organization advocates universal postnatal circumcision and none is calling for a ban. The Royal Dutch Medical Association, which has raised some of the strongest opposition to the custom of postnatal circumcision, argues that even if there were good reasons to ban it, doing so could also turn parents who insist on performing the surgery towards unskilled practitioners rather than medical workers. Arguments keeping surgery within the realm of medical professionals are found in all major medical organizations. In addition, these organizations advise medical professionals to provide parents with several choices, often based on religious or cultural views, in their decision to have circumcision.

In Australia, rates declined in the 1970s and 80s, but have increased slowly since 2004. In the United Kingdom, prevalence was around 25% in the 1940s, but declined dramatically after the National Health Service failed to cover the cost of the procedure. Prevalence in South Korea has increased markedly in the second half of the 20th century, rising from near zero around 1950 to around 60% in 2000, with the most significant jump in the last two decades in that period. This may have been due to influence from the United States, which established a trusteeship for South Korea after World War II. Medical organizations can affect a country's neonatal circumcision rates by influencing whether the costs of the procedure are borne by the parents, insured, or covered by the national health care system. Policies that require a fee to be paid by the parents result in lower rates of neonatal circumcision. The decline in circumcision rates in England is one example, another example is the United States. Policy changes towards circumcision can be driven by new research results, and moderated by politics, demographics, and societal culture. Circumcision is the world's oldest planned surgical procedure, suggested by anatomist and hyperdiffusionist historian Grafton Elliot Smith. Circumcision is over 15,000 years old.

In his 1891 work History of Circumcision, the physician Peter Charles Remondino suggested that circumcision began as a less severe form of emasculating a captured enemy: a penectomy or castration might have been fatal, while a permanent circumcision would have marked defeat and left him alive to serve. as a slave. The history of migration and the evolution of the practice of circumcision is followed primarily through the cultures and peoples of two separate regions. In areas south and east of the Mediterranean, starting with Sudan and Ethiopia, circumcision was practiced in Ancient Egypt and the Semites, then by Judaism and Islam, where the practice was adopted by the Bantu people. In Oceania, circumcision is practiced by Aborigines and Polynesians. There is also evidence that circumcision was practiced in the Aztec and Mayan civilizations, but few details are available on that history. Evidence suggests that circumcision was practiced in the Arabian Peninsula as early as the fourth millennium BC, when Sumerians and Semites moved into what is now Iraq. The earliest historical record of circumcision comes from Egypt, in the form of a circumcision image of an adult carved in the tomb of Ankh-Mahor at Saqqara, c. 2400-2300 BC. Circumcision was performed by the Egyptians probably for health reasons, but it was also part of their obsession with purity and was associated with spiritual and intellectual development. There is no well-accepted theory explaining the importance of circumcision to the Egyptians, but it seems to have been endowed with great honor and importance as a ritual of coming of age, performed in a public ceremony emphasizing the continuation of the family's generations and fertility.",

Circumcision features prominently in the Hebrew Bible. The narrative of Genesis chapter 17 describes the circumcision of Abraham, his relatives and servants, making him the first named individual to undergo circumcision. In the same chapter, Abraham's descendants are commanded to circumcise their children on the eighth day. Many generations later, Moses was raised by the Egyptian elite, so circumcision was no doubt foreign to him. For the Jews of the time, circumcision was not so much a spiritual act as it was a physical sign of their covenant with God, and a prerequisite for the fulfillment of the commandment to produce offspring. As well as proposing purely Jewish circumcision as a religious mandate, academics have suggested that Judaism's ancestors and their followers adopted circumcision to make penile hygiene easier in hot, sandy climates; as a rite of passage into adulthood; or as a form of blood sacrifice. Alexander the Great conquered the Middle East in the fourth century BCE, and in the following centuries ancient Greek culture came to the Middle East. The Greeks hated circumcision, making life for circumcised Jews living among the Greeks (and later Romans) very difficult. Antiochus Epiphanes forbade circumcision, as did Hadrian, who helped cause the Bar Kokhba Rebellion. During this period in history, Jewish circumcision required the removal of only part of the foreskin, and some Hellenistic Jews attempted to appear uncircumcised by stretching the remaining portions of their foreskin. This was considered by Jewish leaders to be a serious problem, and during the 2nd century AD they changed the Jewish circumcision requirement to require complete removal of the foreskin, emphasizing the Jewish view of circumcision as intended to be not just the fulfillment of a Biblical commandment but also an important sign and permanent membership in a nation.",

The Apostle Paul interpreted circumcision as a spiritual concept, arguing that physical circumcision was no longer necessary. The teaching that physical circumcision was not necessary for membership in the divine covenant was instrumental in the separation of Christianity from Judaism. Although not explicitly mentioned in the Quran (early 6th century), circumcision is considered essential to Islam, and it is almost universally practiced among Muslims. The practice of circumcision spread across the Middle East, North Africa and Southern Europe with Islam. The practice of circumcision is thought to have been brought to the Bantu-speaking tribes of Africa either by Jews after one of their many expulsions from European countries, or by Muslim Moors who fled after the Spanish conquest in 1492. In the second half of the first millennium, people from northeastern Africa moved south and met tribes of Arabia, the Middle East and West Africa. These people moved south and formed what are known today as the Bantu. The Bantu were observed enforcing so-called Jewish laws, including circumcision, in the 16th century. Circumcision and elements of Jewish taboos are still found among the Bantu tribes. Compared to the available history of circumcision in the Middle East, there is little verified evidence for the history of circumcision in Aboriginal Australia and Polynesia. What is known about it comes from the oral history of missionaries and explorers.

Circumcision probably began among South American tribes as a blood sacrifice or ritual mutilation to test courage and endurance, and its use later developed into an initiation rite. Circumcision did not become a common medical procedure until the late 19th century. At that time, British and American doctors began to recommend circumcision primarily as a deterrent to masturbation. Before the 20th century, masturbation was believed to be the cause of various physical and mental ailments such as epilepsy, paralysis, impotence, gonorrhea, tuberculosis, intellectual disability, and insanity. In some cultures, males must be circumcised shortly after birth, during childhood or around puberty as part of a rite of passage. Circumcision is commonly practiced in Judaism and Islam. Circumcision is very important to Jews, with more than 90% of adherents having it as a religious obligation. The basis for this obligation is found in the Torah, in Genesis chapter 17, where the circumcision covenant was made for Abraham and his descendants. Jewish circumcision is part of the brit milah ritual, which is performed by a specialist circumciser (a mohel) on the eighth day of a newborn boy's life (with certain exceptions such as illness). Converts to Judaism must also be circumcised, those who have been circumcised undergo a circumcision ritual symbolically. Although there is some debate as to whether circumcision is a religious requirement in Islam, circumcision (called circumcision) is practiced almost universally by Muslim men.

It can be done from soon after birth until around age 15, but is most commonly done around six to seven years. The time may correspond to the completion of the child's reading of the entire Quran. Circumcision can be celebrated with family or community events. Circumcision is encouraged, but not required, for conversion to Islam. One of the chapters of the New Testament, Acts 15 notes that Christianity does not require circumcision. Christians also do not forbid it; The Gospel of Luke states that Jesus himself was circumcised. In 1442, the leadership of the Catholic Church declared that circumcision was not necessary. Coptic Christians practice circumcision as a rite. The Ethiopian Orthodox Church advocates circumcision, with almost universal prevalence among Orthodox males in Ethiopia. In South Africa, some Christian churches disapprove of circumcision, while others require circumcision for their members. Some tribes in Africa, such as the Yoruba and Igbo in Nigeria, practice circumcising their babies. This procedure is also practiced by some tribes or family lines in Sudan, Zaire, Uganda and southern Africa. In some of these tribes, circumcision appears to be cultural, performed without any particular religious significance or intention to discriminate among the members of the tribe.

Biomolecules include large macromolecules (or polyanions) such as proteins, carbohydrates, lipids and nucleic acids, as well as small molecules such as primary metabolites, secondary metabolites and natural products. The more common name for this group is biological matter. Biomolecules are essential elements for living organisms, which are often endogenous, or produced within the organisms themselves. However, organisms usually need exogenous biomolecules, for example certain nutrients, to survive. Biology and its branches, biochemistry and molecular biology, study biomolecules and their reactions. Most biomolecules are organic compounds and only four elements\u2014oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen\u2014make up 96% of the human body by mass. However, many other elements, such as various biometals, are found in trace amounts. Uniformity of the types of biomolecules and metabolic pathways is an unchanging feature among the diversity of life forms; As such, these biomolecules and metabolic pathways are referred to as \"universal biochemistry\" or \"theory of the material unity of living things\", a unifying concept in biology, along with the cell theory and the theory of evolution. There is a wide variety of biomolecules, which include small molecules: lipids, fatty acids, glycolipids, sterols, monosaccharides, vitamins, hormones, neurotransmitters, and metabolites; as well as monomers, oligomers, and polymers as shown in the table below. Monosaccharides (mono- meaning 'one', -saccharides meaning 'sugar') are the simplest form of carbohydrates in the form of one sugar.

When consumed, glucose and fructose have different rates of gastric emptying, are absorbed differently and have different metabolic fates, opening up many opportunities for the two types of saccharides to influence food intake differently. Most of the saccharides are used as fuel for cellular respiration. Disaccharides are formed when two monosaccharides form a glycosidic bond by removing a water molecule. One disaccharide molecule can also be separated into two monosaccharide molecules by hydrolysis. Examples of disaccharides are sucrose, maltose, and lactose. Polysaccharides are monosaccharides polymerized into complex carbohydrates. Examples are starch, cellulose, and glycogen. Polysaccharide molecules are generally large and often have complex branched connectivity. The shorter polysaccharides, with 3 to 10 monomers are called oligosaccharides. Lipids are generally esters of fatty acids, and serve as the basic building blocks of biological membranes and energy storage (eg triglycerides). Most lipids consist of a polar or hydrophilic head region (usually glycerol) and a tail region consisting of one to three fatty acid molecules which are nonpolar or hydrophobic. Due to these two properties, lipids are referred to as amphiphilic molecules. Fatty acids consist of an unbranched chain of carbon atoms connected by single bonds (these types are called saturated fatty acids) or by single and double bonds (these types are called unsaturated fatty acids). The chains usually consist of 14 to 24 carbon groups, and this number is always even.

Egyptian astronomers left monuments showing knowledge of the constellations and the motions of the celestial bodies, while the Greek poet Homer described various celestial bodies in his Iliad and Odyssey; later Greek astronomers gave the names, which are still used today, to most of the constellations visible from the northern hemisphere.

Theories such as quantum mechanics and relativistic theory can be simplified to their classical equivalents. However, the inaccuracy of classical mechanics for very small bodies and very fast objects led to the development of modern physics in the 20th century. Modern physics has its origins in the early 20th century when Max Planck did research on quantum theory and Albert Einstein did research on the theory of relativity. Both of these theories arose due to the inaccuracies of classical mechanics under certain conditions. Classical mechanics predicts that the speed of light varies, not according to the constant speed predicted by Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism. This error was eventually corrected by Einstein through his theory of special relativity, which later replaced classical mechanics for fast-moving objects and their speeds approaching the speed of light. Black-body radiation was also a problem for classical physics, which was later corrected when Planck proposed that the excitation of a material oscillator is possible only in discrete steps proportional to its frequency. This theory, along with the photoelectric effect and later the more complete theory of predicting the discrete energy levels of electron orbitals, eventually allowed the theory of quantum mechanics to replace classical physics at the infinitesimal level. Quantum mechanics appeared pioneered by Werner Heisenberg, Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger and Paul Dirac. From the results of this early work, the standard model of particle physics was derived.

        "paragraph": "The two main theories of modern physics represent different concepts of space, time, and matter from classical physics. Classical mechanics predicts that nature is continuous, whereas quantum theory focuses on the discrete nature of many phenomena on the atomic and subatomic scales and the additional aspects of particles and waves to explain these phenomena. The theory of relativity focuses on the explanation of phenomena that take place in a frame of reference that moves with respect to the observer; the special theory of relativity focuses on uniform motion relative to straight lines and the general theory of relativity with accelerated motion and its relationship to gravity. Quantum theory and the theory of relativity are used in all areas of modern physics. Although physics aims to find universal laws, its theory rests on a specific domain of use. Generally speaking, the laws of classical physics can accurately describe systems larger than the atomic scale and moving much slower than the speed of light. Beyond this, the observations do not match the predictions made. Albert Einstein contributed to the special framework of relativity, which replaced the notation of absolute space and time with spacetime and made possible the accurate description of systems whose components move close to the speed of light. Max Planck, Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, and other physicists introduced quantum mechanics, a probabilistic notation of particles and their interactions that allows accurate descriptions at the atomic and subatomic scales. In the end, quantum field theory combines quantum mechanics and special relativity. General relativity allows for curved, dynamic spacetimes, with extraordinarily massive systems and the structure of the large-scale universe to be explained. General relativity has not yet been conflated; several candidate theories of quantum gravity are being developed. The research culture of physics differs from other disciplines because of the separation of theory and experiment.",

        "paragraph": "Since the twentieth century, most individual physicists have specialized in either theoretical or experimental physics, and in the twentieth century, few have succeeded in either field. On the other hand, almost all theorists in biology and chemistry have also been successful experimentalists. Simply put, theorists try to develop theories that can explain experimental results that have been tried and can predict future experimental results. Meanwhile, experimentalists devise and carry out experiments to test theoretical conjectures. Although theory and experiment were developed separately, they are interdependent. Advances in physics usually occur when experimentalists make discoveries that cannot be explained from existing theory, necessitating the formulation of new theories. Without experimentation, theoretical research often goes in the wrong direction; one example is M-theory, a popular theory in high-energy physics, because experiments to test it have never been devised. Although physics deals with a wide variety of systems, there are several theories that are used in physics as a whole, not in just one area. Each of these theories is believed to be true, within a certain area of \u200b\u200bvalidity. For example, the theory of classical mechanics can accurately describe the motion of an object, provided it is larger than an atom and moving at a speed much slower than the speed of light. These theories are still being researched; for example, the fascinating aspect of classical mechanics known as chaos theory was discovered in the twentieth century, three centuries after it was formulated by Isaac Newton. However, few physicists consider these basic theories to be distorted. Therefore, these theories are used as a basis for research towards more specific topics, and all physicists, regardless of their specialization, are expected to understand these theories. Research in physics is divided into several fields that study different aspects of the material world.",

The field of particle physics, also known as \"high-energy physics\", studies the properties of super-small particles much smaller than atoms, including the elementary particles that make up everything else. Finally, the field of Astrophysics applies the laws of physics to explain astronomical phenomena, ranging from the sun and other objects in the solar system to the universe as a whole. Particle physics is the study of the constituent constituents of matter and energy and the interactions between them. In addition, particle physicists design and develop the high-energy accelerators, detectors, and computer programs required for this research. This branch is also known as \"high-energy physics\" because many elementary particles do not occur naturally but can only be created when the particles collide with each other at high energies. Currently, the interactions between elementary particles and fields are described by the Standard Model. This model includes the 12 known particles of matter (quarks and leptons) that interact via strong, weak, and electromagnetic fundamental forces. Dynamics are described in terms of matter particles exchanging gauge bosons (gluons, W and Z bosons, and photons, respectively). The Standard Model also predicts a particle known as the Higgs boson.

These three fields are covered in classical, semi-classical, and quantum physics; can be treated from a microscopic point of view. Atomic physics studies atoms. Current research focuses on quantum control, cooling, and capture of atoms and ions, low-temperature collision dynamics and the effects of electron correlation on structure and dynamics. The atomic nucleus is affected by the nucleus (eg hyperfine splitting), but inter-nuclear phenomena such as nuclear fission and nuclear fusion are considered part of high energy physics. Molecular physics focuses on the structure of multi-atoms and their internal and external interactions with matter and light. Optical physics differs from optics in its tendency to focus not on the control of light by macroscopic objects but on the basic properties of optical fields and their interactions with matter on the microscopic scale. Condensed matter physics is the field of physics that studies the physical properties of macroscopic matter. In particular, it is concerned with condensed phases which arise when the number of particles in the system is very large and the interactions between them are strong. One of the easiest examples of condensed phases are solids and liquids, which arise from the electromagnetic force bonding between atoms.

In a fictional story \"El Dorado\", Guyana is described as a region rich in gold deposits. Historians estimate that this fictitious story was one of the factors that encouraged Europeans to compete for control of Guyana. In 1449 Spanish sailors, Alonzo de Ojeda and Juan de la Cosa sailed along the northeastern coast of South America, which they called the Wild Coast at that time, and landed in the territory of Guyana.

The element is toxic, valence 2, steel-gray, tough, light but fragile. Beryllium is an alkaline earth metal, whose primary use is as a reinforcing agent in alloys (in particular, beryllium copper). Beryllium has the highest melting point of the light metals. The modulus of elasticity of beryllium is approximately 1/3 greater than that of steel. Beryllium has excellent thermal conductivity, is non-magnetic and is nitric acid corrosion resistant. Beryllium is also easily penetrated by X-rays, and neutrons are released when it is struck by alpha particles, (as radium and polonium have about 30 neutrons/million alpha particles). At room temperature and pressure, beryllium does not oxidize on exposure to air (its ability to scratch glass is probably due to the formation of a thin layer of oxidation). The name beryllium comes from the Greek word beryllos, beryl. Beryllium was once called glucinium (from the Greek glykys, sweet), because of the sweet taste of its salts. The element was discovered by Louis Vauquelin in 1798 as its oxide in beryl and in emeralds. Friedrich W\u00f6hler and A. A. Bussy each isolated the metal in 1828 by the reaction between potassium and beryllium chloride. Beryllium has only one stable isotope, Be-9. Cosmogenic beryllium (Be-10) is produced in the atmosphere by bombardment of oxygen and nitrogen by cosmic rays. Because beryllium often exists in solution at pH levels less than 5.5 (and most rainwater has a pH less than 5), it will dissolve into solution and be transported to the Earth's surface via rainwater.

Chronic beriliosis resembles sarcoidosis in many respects, and the differential diagnosis is difficult. Although the use of beryllium compounds in fluorescent lamps was discontinued in 1949, exposure to beryllium may still occur in the nuclear industry, aviation, refining beryllium metal, smelting beryllium-containing alloys, manufacturing electronic devices and handling beryllium-containing materials.

Its effectiveness depends on the ingredients being exposed and the duration of exposure. If the beryllium content in air is very high (more than 1000 \u00b5g/m\u00b3), an acute state may occur. This condition resembles pneumonia and is called acute beryllium disease. Community and workplace air conditioning is effective in avoiding the most acute forms of lung damage. Some people (1-15%) will be sensitive to beryllium. These people will have an inflammatory reaction in the respiratory system. This condition is called chronic beryllium disease (CBD), and can occur after years of exposure to above normal levels of beryllium (above 0.2 \u00b5g/m\u00b3).

CBD can cause anorexia, weight loss, and can also lead to enlargement of the right side of the heart and heart disease in advanced cases.

The Bangladesh Association of International Recruiting Agencies (BAIRA) is a national-level association of migrant labor recruitment agencies, with around 1300 member agencies cooperating with and receiving support from the Government of Bangladesh. Currently BAIRA is also one of the largest trade bodies in Bangladesh affiliated with the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce & Industry which was established in 1973. In the province of Ontario, Canada, if you have a formal complaint, you can submit it to the Department of Labour. Meanwhile in the Canadian province of Quebec, complaints can be filed with the Commission des normes du travail. In addition, in Canada there is The Canadian Human Rights Act which regulates the protection of workers from discrimination when they are employed, so employers and service providers must ensure that all employees are treated equally.",

        "paragraph": "The editor logged out page learn more White is the representation of the presence of all the primary colors in maximum state with equal proportions. White, like black and gray, cannot be said to be defined as a particular color. White in an ideal sense means the presence of all colors with maximum light so that they can no longer be represented by the eye or the camera sensor, contrary to the ideal definition of black. However several approaches to white have been carried out with pigments, for example chinese white, pure white, or other white derivatives often used in fine art supplies such as pastels or acrylics. In process inks for printing, white means no use of any of the Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, or Key pigments. However, for certain purposes, white fields are formed with process white ink. In photography, white is a sign that the film or sensor has exceeded its ability to capture light. This often occurs in long exposure techniques or arises due to errors in measuring light so that it becomes over exposed. White has been generally accepted as the standard paper color in stationery. Because of that white is used by printers to determine areas that are not subject to ink. In making works of art, artists usually mix white with other colors to get colors called pastel colors, although this is not very precise because not all sticks of pastel produce these colors. Also in the use of pastels or acrylics, white that is superimposed firmly on top of the dried color will produce a flashing light effect. Psychologically, the effect of white can vary. This is influenced mainly by the local culture. For example, in Europe, white is considered calming, cool and timeless because of its association with snow.",

He was a king who ruled the Kuru kingdom, with the center of government in Hastinapura. He is the eldest of the five Pandavas, or sons of Pandu. In the puppet tradition, Yudistira was given the title of king and had the nickname Puntadewa, while his kingdom was called the Kingdom of Amarta. The name Yudistira in Sanskrit means \"firm or firm in battle\". In the Mahabharata book, he is also referred to as Bharata (descendant of Maharaja Bharata) and Ajatasatru. He is also known as Dharmaraja, which means \"Dharma king\", because he always tried to uphold dharma throughout his life. Some of the other epithets that Yudhisthira had were Kururaja (\u0915\u0941\u0930\u0941\u0930\u093e\u091c, \"leader of the Kuru race\"), Kurunandana (\u0915\u0941\u0930\u0942\u0928\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0928, \"beloved of the Kuru Dynasty\"), Kurupati (\u0915\u0941\u0930\u0941\u092a\u0924\u093f, \"king of the Kuru Dynasty\"), Pandava (\u092a\u093e\u0928\u094d\u0926\u094d\u0935, \"son of Pandu\"), Parta (\u092a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0925, \"son of Prita or Kunti\"). Some of the above names were also used by other figures of the Kuru Dynasty, such as Arjuna, Bhishma, and Duryodhana. In addition to the above names, in the Javanese puppet version there are still several other names or nicknames for Yudistira, for example: Puntadewa (\"his degree of nobility is equal to the gods\"), Yudistira (\"skillful in fighting personal lust\"), Gunatalikrama (\"skillful speak the language\"), Samiaji (\"respect others as yourself\"). Yudistira was the eldest son of Pandu and Kunti, king and queen of the Kuru Dynasty, with the center of government in Hastinapura. The first part of the Mahabharata book (Adiparwa) tells about the curse that Pandu experienced after killing a brahmin named Resi Kindama by accident. The Brahmin was struck by Pandu's arrow while he and his wife were having intercourse in the form of a pair of deer.",

Regretfully, Pandu left the throne of Hastinapura and began life as a hermit in the forest to reduce his passions. His two wives, Kunti and Madri, faithfully followed him. After not having children for a long time, Pandu expressed his intention to have children. Kunti, who mastered the Adityahredaya mantra, immediately fulfilled her husband's wish. The mantra is the art of summoning a god to get a son. By using this mantra, Kunti managed to summon the god Dharma and get the gift of a son from him without having sexual intercourse. The first son was named Yudistira. Thus, Yudhisthira became the eldest son of Pandu, as a result of being gifted by Dharma, the god of justice and wisdom. The story in Javanese wayang is somewhat different. According to this version, Puntadewa is Pandu's biological son who was born in the palace of Hastinapura. The arrival of Bhatara Dharma was only to help the birth of Puntadewa and give his blessing. Thanks to the god's help, Puntadewa was born through Kunti's crown. In Javanese wayang, the name Puntadewa is more often used, while the name Yudistira is only used after he grows up and becomes king. This version depicts Puntadewa as a human with white blood, which is an allegory that he is a figure with a pure heart and always upholds the truth. Yudistira and his four younger siblings, namely Bima (Bimasena), Arjuna, Nakula and Sadewa returned to Hastinapura after their father (Pandu) died. At that time, Hastinapura was led by Dhritarastra, Pandu's brother who was blind. The five sons of Pandu\u2014who are known as the Pandavas\u2014make their cousins, namely the sons of Dretarastra (one hundred Korawas led by Duryodhana) feel jealous. Bhishma (an elder of the Kuru dynasty) and Widura (prime minister) favored Yudistira over Dhritarastra's son, so that Duryodhana was worried if Yudistira succeeded in being crowned as crown prince.",

On the other hand, Yudistira always tries to persuade Bima not to reply to the Korawa's actions. The Pandavas and Korawas then studied religion, law and state administration from Resi Krepa. In this education, Yudistira appeared as the smartest student. Krepa really supports it when the throne of Hastinapura is handed over to the oldest Pandawa. After that, the Pandavas and Korawas studied war science from Resi Drona. In this second education, Arjuna appeared as the most intelligent student, especially in archery. Meanwhile, Yudistira himself was more skilled in using spear weapons. As long as Pandu lived in the forest until he finally died, the throne of Hastinapura was temporarily held by his older brother, Dretarastra, the father of the Kauravas. When Yudistira reached adulthood, the time had come for Dhritarashtra to hand over the throne to Yudhisthira, as the eldest son of Pandu and the oldest prince in the Kuru dynasty. Meanwhile, Duryodhana tries hard to seize the throne and get rid of the Pandavas. With the help of Shakuni (maternal uncle), Duryodhana pretended to entertain his five cousins \u200b\u200bin a building in Waranavata. The building itself is made of flammable material, and the architect (Purocana) called it Laksagraha, meaning \"House of Candles\". When night fell, the Kauravas set fire to the building where the Pandavas and Kunti, their mother, were sleeping. However, Yudistira had already prepared himself because his uncle, Widura, Pandu's younger brother, heard about the plan to kill him. As a result, the five Pandavas and Kunti managed to escape death. The Pandavas and Kunti then went through various difficult experiences.

His second wife was named Dewika, daughter of Gowasana of the Saibya tribe, and had a son named Yodeya. The Javanese version calls Draupadi by the name \"Draupadi\". According to Javanese wayang, after winning the contest, Arjuna handed over the daughter to Puntadewa as the eldest sister. At first Puntadewa refused, but after being pressured by his mother and four younger siblings, he finally agreed to marry Draupadi. From this marriage was born a son named Pancawala. So, according to the original version, the character of Dropadi is married to the five Pandavas, while according to the Javanese version, she is only married to Yudistira alone. After marrying Draupadi, the Pandavas returned to Hastinapura and received an extraordinary welcome, except from Duryodhana. The rivalry between the Pandavas and Korawas for the throne of Hastinapura is back. The elders finally agreed to give the Pandavas some of the kingdom's territory. The Korawas got the Hastinapura palace, while the Pandavas got the Kandawaprastha forest as a place to build a new palace. Even though the area was very arid and haunted, the Pandavas were willing to accept the area. In addition to its area covering almost half the area of \u200b\u200bthe Kuru kingdom, Kandawaprastha was also the capital of the former Kuru kingdom, before Hastinapura. The Pandavas were assisted by their cousins, namely Kresna and Baladewa, and managed to open Kandawaprastha into a new settlement. The Pandavas then received help from Wiswakarma, a builder from heaven, and also Anggaparna from the Gandharwa nation.

Matsyapati who sympathized with the experience of the Pandavas suggested that they open up an uninhabited forest area called Wanamarta into a new kingdom. Wanamarta Forest is inhabited by various ethereal beings led by five brothers, named Yudistira, Danduncana, Suparta, Sapujagad, and Sapulebu. The work of the Pandavas in clearing the forest encountered many obstacles. Finally after going through a conversation, the ethereal beings surrender Wanamarta to the Pandavas. Yudistira then moved Amarta's palace from the genie realm to the real realm to be inhabited by the Pandavas. After that, he and his four siblings disappeared. One version mentions that the five of them each merged into the five Pandavas. Puntadewa then became the King of Amarta after being pushed and forced by his four younger siblings. To remember and respect the genie king who had given him a palace, Puntadewa took the title Prabu Yudistira. After becoming the King of Amarta, Puntadewa tried hard to prosper his country. It is said that the news was heard that anyone who can marry the princess of Slagahima Kingdom named Dewi Kuntulwinanten, then the country where he lives will become prosperous and prosperous. Puntadewa himself has decided to have only one wife. But because Draupadi allowed him to marry again for the sake of the country's prosperity, he set off for the Kingdom of Slagahima. At the Slagahima palace many kings and princes have gathered who came to propose to Kuntulwinanten.

Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, and Sadewa led their respective armies to the four corners of Bharatawarsha (Ancient India) to collect tribute in the grand ceremony. At the same time, an angry Angkara king also held a ceremony to sacrifice a hundred kings. The king was named Jarasanda from the kingdom of Magadha. Yudhishthira sent Bhima and Arjuna accompanied by Krishna as advisors to defeat Jarasanda. Finally, through an exciting contest, Bima managed to kill Jarasanda. After all the requirements were met, Yudistira performed the Rajasuya ceremony which was attended by many kings and priests. On that occasion, Yudistira was designated as Maharajadhiraja. Then appeared an ally of Jarasanda named Sisupala who insulted Krishna in public. After passing the 100th insult, Krishna finally beheaded Sisupala in public. When he was a guest at the Rajasuya event, Duryodana was very impressed and envious of the beauty of the Indraprastha palace. His intention to seize the kingdom arose, especially after he was offended by Draupadi's speech in a meeting. Sangkuni helped Duryodhana's intentions by taking advantage of Yudhishthira's fondness for the game of dice. Yudistira was indeed a religious man, but on the other hand he loved the game very much. Duryodhana's invitation was accepted well. A dice game between the Pandavas against the Kauravas was held in the Hastinapura palace. At first Yudistira only bet small.

The four of them also fell into the hands of Duryodhana one by one, and finally Yudistira himself. Duryodhana still forced Yudistira, who had lost his independence, to continue the game, risking Draupadi. As a result, Draupadi also met the same fate. Draupadi's wailing when publicly humiliated was heard by Gandari, the mother of the Kauravas. He ordered that Duryodhana stop the game and return everything to the Pandavas. With a heavy heart, Duryodhana was forced to obey his mother's orders. Duryodhana who was disappointed again challenged Yudhisthira some time later. This time the rules changed. Whoever the loser must surrender the state and its contents, and live in the jungle for 12 years and undercover for a year in a kingdom. If the impersonation was discovered, it must repeat the disposal for 12 years and disguise a year, and so on. Finally, thanks to Sakuni's cunning, the Pandavas suffered defeat for the second time. Since then the five Pandavas and Draupadi have spent their exile in the forest. The life of the Pandavas and Dropadi during their 12 year exile in the forest is narrated in the third volume of the Mahabharata book known as Wanaparwa.

Indra was surprised that Yudistira had the heart to leave his siblings and Draupadi without holding a cremation ceremony for them, but preferred not to leave a dog behind. Yudhisthira replied that he had not left them, but they had left him. Yudhisthira's loyalty has been tested. The dog returned to its original form, namely Dewa Yama or batara dharma, his father.

Nasution, who once served as commander in chief of the Indonesian National Armed Forces-Army (TNI-AD), wrote in the book \"Basics of Guerrilla\". For soldiers guerrilla warfare is very effective. They can trick, cheat or even carry out a blitz. This tactic is also very helpful and effective when attacking a large number of enemies who have lost their way and do not control the terrain. Sometimes this tactic also leads to an invisible siege tactic. Until now this tactic is still used by terrorists to hide. If they master the field they can do: hostage detention, training, assassination, to become spies. And the enemy can be nomadic, that is, move around and attack in hiding without being noticed by the opponent. Indonesia's big figure in guerrilla tactics is General Soedirman. General Soedirman made it impossible for the Dutch to win against the Indonesian guerrilla forces at that time. This tactic was later used by Ho Chi Minh in the Vietnam War so that North Vietnam won a landslide victory against South Vietnam and the United States. Guerrilla tactics were also used by many resistance forces, such as the Spanish Resistance Army under Napoleon Bonaparte. Guerrilla tactics are more or less covert, killing the enemy in a surprise attack. So trapping the enemy is the most important thing in guerrilla tactics.

The cantillation is written and notated with special signs printed in the Masoretic text of the Hebrew Bible (or Tanakh) to complete letter dots and vowels. These signs are known in English as accents, notes or trope symbols, and in Hebrew as \u05d8\u05e2\u05de\u05d9 \u05d4\u05de\u05e7\u05e8\u05d0 ta'amei ha-micra or simply \u05d8\u05e2\u05de\u05d9\u05dd te'amim. Some of these signs are also occasionally used in medieval Mishnah texts. The musical motifs associated with these signs are known in Hebrew as the niggun or neginot (as opposed to the Hasidic nigun) and in Yiddish as \u05d8\u05e8\u05d0\u05b8\u05e4 trop; the word trope is sometimes used in English with the same meaning. Three systems of Hebrew punctuation (including vowel and cantillation symbols) are known to have been used: Babylonian, Palestinian and Tiberian; only the latter is currently in use. Babylonian Bible manuscripts from the Geonic period do not contain the hymn marks used today, but use small Hebrew letters to mark significant divisions in a verse. Up to eight different letters are found, depending on the importance of the break and where it occurs in the verse: these correspond approximately to the disjunctives of the Tiberian system. For example, in some codices the letter tav, for tevir (rest), is defined in the same way as the Tiberian tevir and zaqef. There are generally no symbols for the conjunctives, although some late manuscripts use these Tiberian symbols. There is also no equivalent for low-grade disjunctives such as telishah gedolah: these are generally replaced by the equivalent sign zaqef or revia.",

(Somewhat similar to the system used in Qur'anic manuscripts to guide the reader in reciting verses: see Quran reading.) This system is reflected in the chant sign practices of the Yemenite Jews, who today uses Tiberian symbols, but tends to have musical motifs only for disjunctives and makes the conjunctives monotonous. The Yemenite Jews have only eight disjunctive motifs, thus clearly reflecting Babylonian notation. The same is true of the Karaite mode for haftarah; while in the Sephardi haftarah mode the different disjunctives often have the same or nearly the same motives, reducing the effective number of motives to the same amount. The Babylonian system, as mentioned above, is primarily concerned with indicating breaks in the verse. In contrast, the Early Palestinian texts are primarily concerned with the assignment of phrases: for example the sequences tifcha-etnachta, zarqa-segolta and pashta-zaqef, with or without the intervention of accented words. These sequences are generally linked by a series of dots, which are started or ended with dashes or dots in different places to indicate the sequence in question. Accented words (which in the Tiberian system denote conjunctives) are generally indicated by dots following words, ostensibly to link them to the next word. There are separate symbols for more complicated tropes such as pazer and telisha gedolah. Manuscripts are generally highly fragmentary, no two of them follow the same convention, and these marks may represent each reader's aide-memoire rather than a formal system of punctuation marks (for example, vowel signs are often used only where other words would be ambiguous). Within one manuscript, possibly of a younger date, there are separate signposts for the various conjunctives, completely outnumbering the Tiberian system (e.g., munach before etnachta has a different sign from munach before zaqef), and the overall system approaches the Tiberian in its completeness. .",

        "paragraph": "In some other codices, especially those containing the Targumim rather than the original text, the Tiberian symbols were added by later hands. In general, it can be observed that the Palestinian and Tiberian systems are much more closely related to each other than the Babylonian system. This system of phrases is reflected in the Sephardic cantillation mode, in which conjunctives (and to some extent \"close accompaniments\" such as tifcha, pashta and zarqa) are given as flourishes leading to motifs following disjunctives rather than as motives of their own. The somewhat inconsistent use of dots above and below words as disjunctives is similar to that found in Syriac texts. Kahle also notes some similarities to the punctuation of the Samaritan Hebrew. By the tenth century AD, the chants used in Palestine had evidently become more complex, both because of the presence of pazer, geresh and telisha motifs in long verses and because of the realization that a phrase ending with a particular type of break varied according to the number of verses. words and syllables in the phrase. Because of this, the Tiberian Masoretes decided to create a comprehensive notation with symbols for each word, to replace the previously used separate system. In particular, it was necessary to create various accent words to show how to introduce and develop main motifs in long phrases. (For example, tevir is preceded by yan, a short flourish, in a short phrase but by darga, which is more complicated carrying the notes, in a long phrase.) The system they used is one used today, and is found in biblical texts such as Aleppo Codex.

This system of cheironomy has survived in some communities to this day, especially in Italy. There is speculation that the shapes and names of some accents (e.g. tifcha, literally \"hand width\") may refer to hand signals rather than to the syntax of the function or melody they represent. Today in most societies there is no hand signal system and the reader learns the melody of each recitation beforehand. The Tiberian system spread quickly and was accepted in all societies by the 13th century. Each community reinterpreted the tradition of recitation so as to allocate a short musical motif to each symbol: this process has spread as far back as Western Ashkenazi and Ottoman (Jerusalem-Sephardi, Syrian etc.) traditions. Learning the accent and the music of the song is now an important part of preparing for a bar mitzvah, as it is the first occasion where one reads from the Torah in public. Early in the Reformation period there was a movement to abandon the system of hymn signs, and to give readings of the Scriptures in normal speech (in Hebrew or in the vernacular). In recent decades, however, traditional chant signs have been restored in many communities. The main purpose of hymn signs is to guide the chanting of sacred texts during public worship. Roughly speaking, every word of the text that has a cantillation mark on the main accent and corresponds to that sign is a musical phrase that tells how to sing those words.

The word tambak, used in Hebrew to refer to a chant mark, literally means \"sense\" or \"sense\", meaning that the pauses and intonations indicated by the accent (with or without formal music) bring out the feeling of the passage. There are two systems of cantal signs in the Tanakh. One of them is used in twenty-one books of prose, while the other appears in the three poetic books of Psalms, Proverbs and Job. Unless otherwise stated, this article describes the \"prose\" of the system. Currently the cantillation note system has historical roots in the Tiberian masorah. The cantillation mark is entered in Unicode as the characters U+0591 to U+05AF in the block of the Hebrew alphabet . The names of some of the cantillation signs differ in Ashkenazi, Sephardi, Italian and Yemeni traditions; for example Sephardim use qadma which means the same as Ashkenazim pashta, and azla is the same as Ashkenazim qadma. In this article, as in most Hebrew grammars, Ashkenazi terminology is used. Names in other traditions are shown in the table below. The cantillation signs serve three functions: In general, each word in the Tanakh has one cantillation mark. It may be either disjunction, indicating a division between being and the following words, or a word, joining two words (like a slur in music).

Disjunctives are traditionally divided into four levels, with the lower level disjunctives marking the less important break. The general conjunctive is munach. Depending on which separates the following, it can be replaced by yan, mahpach, darga, qadma, telisha qetannah or yerach ben yomo. One of the other symbols is yan full, double yan. There is some debate about whether this is a link or an occasional replacement for tevir. Disjunctives function somewhat similarly to punctuation in Western languages. Sof pasuq can be thought of as full stop, atnach as semi-colon, second degree disjunctives as comma and third degree disjunctives as comma or unsigned. Where the two words are written in building a country (eg, pene ha-mayim, \"the face of the waters\"), the first noun (nomen regens) always carries a conjunction. The cantillation sign is often an important aid in the interpretation of a passage. For example, the words qol qore beautiful dead sea panu derekh YHWH (Isaiah 40:3) are translated in the Official Version as \"a voice that cries out in the wilderness: Prepare the way for the LORD\".

Some signs always go on the first or last consonant of a word. This may be for the music, or perhaps to distinguish them from other accents of the same form. For example, pashta, which runs on the last consonant, is otherwise visible like qadma, which runs on the stressed syllable. Several written signs (and sung) are different when the word is not stressed on the last syllable. The pashta in words of this kind is doubled, one goes on the stressed syllable and the other on the consonant end. Geresh is doubled, unless it occurs in a non-finally-stressed word or follows qadma (to form the phrase qadma ve-azla). The hymn signs guide the reader in applying the Bible hymns to the reading. The incantation is technically considered a ritual form of speech intonation rather than a musical exercise like the rhythmic singing of hymns: for this reason, Jews always speak of reciting or reciting a passage rather than singing.

Musicologists have dismissed her results as dubious and her methodology as flawed. Within the Ashkenazi musical or cantillation traditions, each geographic area's customs include a total of six major melodies and a variety of separate minor melodies for the cantillation: The Ashkenazic tradition retains the distinctive melodic cantillation notes of the Psalms, Proverbs, and Job, which are not commonly read in synagogues by European Jews. However, the Ashkenazic yeshiva known as Aderet Eliyahu, or (more informally) Zilberman's, in the Old City of Jerusalem, used an adaptation of the Syrian hymn-melodic for these books, and it became more popular among other Ashkenazim. early 20th century there was only one Ottoman-Sefardi tradition (no doubt local variations) covering Turkey, Syria, Palestine and Egypt. Today, Sefardi-Jerusalem, Syrian, Egyptian and Baghdad melodies are recognized as one family. For example, in traditions reading the Torah is always or almost always at Maqam Sigah. There are some variations, among individual readers as well as among communities: for example the Egyptian melody relates to the more complex and multi-tone Syrian melody and transitions towards Maqam Huzzam before the mass expulsion in 1950. The Karaite Jewish tradition, based in Egypt, is also part of the group. this. Another well-known family consists of Iraqi melodies (Mosul and the Iraqi diaspora), Moroccan-Spanish, Spanish and Portuguese.

This theory has included and replaced the Continental Shift Theory which was previously put forward in the first half of the 20th century and the concept of seafloor spreading which was developed in the 1960s. In short, because the outermost part of the Earth's interior is formed by two layers. At the top there is the lithosphere which consists of the crust and the top of the earth's mantle whose contents are rigid and solid. Beneath the lithosphere layer is the asthenosphere which is solid but can flow like a liquid very slowly and over a very long geological time scale due to its low viscosity and shear strength. Even deeper, the mantle below the asthenosphere becomes even more rigid. The cause is not colder temperatures, but high pressure. The lithosphere is divided into tectonic plates. On Earth, there are seven main plates and many smaller ones. These lithospheric plates ride on top of the asthenosphere. They move relative to one another at plate boundaries, either diverging (away), converging (collating), or transforming (sideways). Earthquakes, volcanic activity, mountain building, and oceanic trench formation all commonly occur in areas along plate boundaries. The lateral movement of the plates is usually at a speed of 50\u2013100 mm/a. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, geologists assumed that the main features of the Earth were fixed. Most geological features such as mountains can be explained by the vertical movement of the crust as described in the geosyncline theory.",

This precision becomes even clearer when we look at the edges of the continental shelves there. Since then many theories have been put forward to explain this, but all have been deadlocked because the assumption that the earth is completely solid makes it difficult to find a suitable explanation. The discovery of radium and its heating properties in 1896 prompted a reassessment of the age of the earth, since previously estimates were obtained from its cooling rate and assuming the earth's surface was irradiated like a black body. From these calculations it follows that even if the Earth was a red-hot body at first, the Earth's temperature would decrease to what it is today in a few tens of millions of years. Given this newly discovered heat source, scientists think it plausible that the Earth is actually much older and its core is still hot enough to be in a liquid state. The theory of plate tectonics originates from the continental drift hypothesis proposed by Alfred Wegener in 1912 and further developed in his book The Origin of Continents and Oceans published in 1915. moving apart thus stripping the continents of the Earth's core like 'icebergs' of low-density granite floating on a sea of \u200b\u200bdenser basalt.

His theory also proved that convection currents in the Earth's mantle were the driving force. The first evidence that the plates were moving came from finding differences in the direction of the magnetic fields in rocks of different ages. This discovery was stated for the first time at a symposium in Tasmania in 1956. Initially, this discovery was included in the theory of the expansion of the earth, but later it led to the development of a theory of plate tectonics which explained spreading as a consequence of vertical movement (upwelling) of rocks , but avoids the need for an earth whose size continues to grow or expand (expanding earth) by including subduction zones and translation faults. It was at this time that the theory of plate tectonics changed from a radical theory to a theory that was commonly used and then widely accepted among scientists. Further research on the relationship between seafloor spreading and geomagnetic reversal by geologist Harry Hammond Hess and oceanographer Ron G. Mason pinpointed the mechanism that explains the vertical movement of the new rock. As it was accepted that the Earth's magnetic anomaly represented by symmetrical parallel stripes with equal magnetization on the seafloor on both sides of the mid-oceanic ridge, plate tectonics became widely accepted. Rapid advances in early seismic imaging techniques in and around the Wadati-Benioff zone and a variety of other geological observations soon established plate tectonics as a theory of enormous explanatory and predictive capabilities. Research on the deep sea floor, a branch of marine geology which developed rapidly in the 1960s, played an important role in the development of this theory.",

The outer layer, the earth's interior is divided into lithosphere and asthenosphere layers based on mechanical differences and the way heat transfer occurs. The lithosphere is colder and stiffer, while the asthenosphere is hotter and mechanically weaker. In addition, the lithosphere loses heat by conduction, whereas the asthenosphere also transfers heat by convection and has an almost adiabatic temperature gradient. This division is very different from the chemical division of the Earth into a core, mantle, and crust. The lithosphere itself includes the crust as well as part of the mantle. A part of the mantle may become part of the lithosphere or asthenosphere at different times, depending on temperature, pressure and shear strength. The key principle of plate tectonics is that the lithosphere separates into distinct tectonic plates. This plate moves on top of the asthenosphere which has viscoelasticity so that it behaves like a fluid. Plate movement can be as fast as 10\u201340 mm/a (as fast as a fingernail grows) as on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, or as fast as 160 mm/a (as fast as a hair grows) as on the Nazca Plate. These plates are about 100 km thick and consist of a lithosphere mantle topped with a bed of one of two types of crustal material. The first is oceanic crust or \"sima\" as it is often called, a mixture of silicon and magnesium. The second is the crust. continent which is often called \"unlucky\", a combination of silicon and aluminum. These two types of crust differ in terms of thickness where the continental crust has a much higher thickness compared to the oceanic crust.",

        "paragraph": "The thickness of the continental crust is 30\u201350 km, while the oceanic crust is only 5\u201310 km. The two plates will meet along plate boundaries, which are areas where geological activity commonly occurs such as earthquakes and the formation of topographical features such as mountains, volcanoes and oceanic trenches. Most of the world's active volcanoes occur along plate boundaries, with the Pacific Plate's Ring of Fire being the most active and widely known. Tectonic plates can be continental or oceanic crust, but usually one plate consists of both. For example, the African Plate includes the continent itself and parts of the bottom of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. The difference between continental crust and oceanic crust is based on the density of the material that forms it. There are three types of plate boundaries that differ in the way the plates move relative to one another. These three types each correspond to different phenomena on the surface. The three types of plate boundaries are: The movement of tectonic plates can occur due to the relative density of the oceanic lithosphere and the relatively weak character of the asthenosphere. Dissipation of heat from the mantle has been found to be the original source of the energy driving plate tectonics. The currently accepted view, though still somewhat disputed, is that the excess density of the oceanic lithosphere causing it to sink downward in subduction zones is the strongest source of plate motion. At the time of its formation on the mid-ocean ridge, the oceanic lithosphere was initially lower in density than the surrounding asthenosphere, but this density increases with aging due to cooling and thickening. The large density of the old lithosphere relative to the underlying asthenosphere allows for intrusion into the deep mantle at subduction zones so that it becomes the source of most of the driving force for plate movements.",

        "paragraph": "The weakness of the asthenosphere allows the plate to move easily towards the subduction zone. Although subduction is believed to be the strongest driving force for plate movements, there are still other driving forces as evidenced by the presence of plates such as the North American plate, as well as the Eurasian plate which is moving but not subducting anywhere. This driving source is still a topic of intensive research and discussion among earth science scientists. Two- and three-dimensional imaging of the Earth's interior (seismic tomography) shows a laterally heterogeneous distribution of density throughout the mantle. These variations in density can be material (from rock chemistry), mineral (from variations in mineral structure), or thermal (through thermal expansion and contraction from heat energy). The manifestation of lateral density heterogeneity is mantle convection from buoyancy forces. How mantle convection relates directly or indirectly to planetary motion is still a field that is being studied and discussed in geodynamics. One way or another, this energy must be transferred to the lithosphere for the tectonic plates to move. There are two main types of forces that affect planetary motion, namely friction and gravity. In a study published in the January-February 2006 issue of the Geological Society of America Bulletin, a team of scientists from Italy and the United States argued that the westward component of the plates originates from the Earth's rotation and the tidal friction of the moon that follows it. They say because the Earth rotates eastward under the moon, the moon's gravity, even if it's minuscule, pulls the Earth's surface layers back west. Some have also advanced the controversial idea that these results might also explain why Venus and Mars lack plate tectonics, namely because there are no moons on Venus and the moons of Mars are too small to give it a tidal-like effect on Earth.",

This was originally proposed by the father of the hypothesis himself, Alfred Wegener, and later challenged by the physicist Harold Jeffreys who calculated that the magnitude of the tidal force needed would quickly bring the Earth's rotation to a halt long ago. Many plates also move to the north and west, even a lot of movement to the west of the Pacific Ocean floor is seen from the point of view of the spreading center in the Pacific Ocean which is facing east. It is also argued that relative to the lower mantle, there is a slight westerly component to the motion of all plates. The actual vector in the motion of a planet should be a function of all the forces acting on those plates. However, the issue is how much each process participates in the movement of each plate. The diversity of geodynamic conditions and the properties of each plate should make a difference in how actively those processes move the plate. one way of dealing with this problem is to look at the rate at which each plate moves and consider the available evidence for any driving force of these plates as far as possible. [citation needed] One of the most important relationships found is that lithospheric plates stick to subducted plates. much faster than a plate that does. For example, the Pacific Plate is surrounded by a subduction zone (the Ring of Fire) and so it moves much faster than the plate in the Atlantic which is attached to adjacent continents and is not a subducted plate. Thus, the forces associated with the downward moving plate (slab pull and slab suction) are the driving forces that determine plate movement except for plates that are not subducting. However, the driving force of plate movement itself is still a matter of debate and research by scientists. References are needed] Earth has seven main plates and many small plates.",

As a result of the crash of this plane, 4 planes in the next wave thought that the school was a military target, and directed bombs at the school which caused the death of 123 civilians, 87 of whom were students. However, 18 of the 26 political prisoners in the Shell House managed to escape while the Gestapo archives were completely destroyed. On May 8, 1945 Copenhagen was officially liberated by British troops commanded by Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery who also handled 30,000 German soldiers who surrendered. Not long after the war ended, an urban development project called the Finger Plan appeared in 1947, encouraging the development of residential areas and business centers that spread out from the city center to the S-train routes. In addition, schools, hospitals, sports facilities were also rebuilt. As a result of the late 1960s student riots, the B\u00e5dsmandsstr\u00e6de Barrack in Christianshavn was occupied, leading to the establishment of Freetown Christiania in September 1971.",

Nucleotides are composed of three subunits, namely a heterocyclic nitrogenous base group (which is called a nucleotide base or nucleobase), a pentose sugar (which is either ribose or deoxyribose), and at least one phosphate group. The four types of nucleobases in DNA are guanine (G), adenine (A), cytosine (C), and thymine (T); in RNA, the nucleobase used is uracil (U) instead of thymine. Nucleotides play an important role in metabolism at the basic and cellular level. Nucleotides contain chemical energy in the form of nucleotide triphosphates, namely adenosine triphosphate (ATP), guanosine triphosphate (GTP), cytidine triphosphate (CTG), and uridine triphosphate (UTP). These energy packages are distributed throughout the body's cells and provide energy for metabolic functions such as the synthesis of amino acids, proteins, cell membranes, and organelles; movement of cells and organelles (intracellular and extracellular); to cell division through mitosis and meiosis. In addition, the nucleotide participates in cell signaling via cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and is a subunit for several cofactors, such as CoA, FAD, FMN, NAD, and NADP\u207a. In cells, these cofactors play important roles in energy fixation (e.g. photosynthesis), metabolism, and cellular signal transduction. In experimental biochemistry, nucleotides can react with radionuclides to form radionucleotides. This process is called radiolabeling and is very important for exploring chemical reaction mechanisms.",

The combination of a pentose sugar and a nucleobase is called a nucleoside. When the three subunits are joined, the nucleotide is also referred to as a \"nucleoside monophosphate\", \"nucleoside diphosphate\", or \"monosaccharide triphosphate\", depending on the amount of phosphate that makes it up. guanine) or pyrimidine (consisting of thymine, cytosine or uracil), and are referred to as ribonucleotides if the sugar is ribose or deoxyribonucleotide if the sugar is deoxyribose. In two adjacent nucleotide monomers, the phosphate group of one nucleotide is linked to the pentose sugar of the other nucleotide via carbon number 5 (called 5') by a covalent ester bond. This bond is called a phosphodiester bond. The bonds between one nucleotide and another form a long chain called a polynucleotide chain. This chain of combined sugar and phosphate molecules forms the strand as a 'backbone' in the form of a single or double twist. In one strand, the chemical orientation (direction) of the chain is said to be from the 5'-end to the 3'-end. This number refers to the five carbon sites in the sugar molecule in adjacent nucleotides. In a double twist, the two strands have opposite orientations. One chain has an orientation from 5' to 3', while the other chain has an orientation from 3' to 5'. This allows base pairs to be mutually complementary between them. All of these properties play an important role in DNA replication as well as the transcription of the genetic information encoded in DNA. Purine bases, namely adenine (A) and guanine (G), as well as pyrimidine bases, namely cytosine (C), are found in both DNA and RNA.",

In addition to being the building blocks for nucleic acids, single nucleotides play a role in cellular energy storage and provision, cellular signaling, as a source of phosphate groups used to modulate the activity of proteins and other signaling molecules, and as enzymatic cofactors that often carry out redox reactions. Cyclic nucleotides in signaling are formed by attaching a phosphate group twice to the same sugar molecule, and bridging the 5' and 3' hydroxyl groups of the sugar. Some signaling nucleotides have different configurations of phosphate groups because they have multiple phosphate groups attached to different sites on the sugar. Nucleotide cofactors contain a wider range of chemical groups that are bonded to sugars via glycosidic bonds, including nicotinamide and flavin; in the case of flavin, the ribose sugar is more linear than the ring shape seen in other nucleotides. cAMP, a cyclic nucleotide that acts as a signaling molecule with a single phosphate attached to the 5- and 3- positions. pppGpp, a signaling molecule nucleotide with 5'- and 3'- phosphates. NADP, a dinucleotide as an enzymatic cofactor. FAD, an enzymatic cofactor dinucleotide with one of the ribose sugars adopts a linear configuration instead of a ring.

        "paragraph": "In vivo, nucleotides can be synthesized de novo or recycled via salvage reaction pathways. Components used in de novo synthesis of nucleotides are derived from biosynthetic precursors from carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism, and from ammonia and carbon dioxide. The liver is an important organ that performs de novo synthesis of all nucleotides. The de novo synthesis of pyrimidine bases and purines occurs in two different ways. Pyrimidine is synthesized first from aspartate and carbamoyl phosphate in the cytoplasm, forming the common ring precursor structure of orotic acid. The phosphorylated ribosyl group is then joined to the orotic acid structure, via covalent bonds. Purines are synthesized first from a sugar template where ring synthesis is carried out. Synthesis of pyrimidine and purine nucleotides is carried out by enzymes in the cytoplasm, not within specific organelles. The nucleotides are broken down and the useful parts can be reused in synthesis reactions to make new nucleotides. The synthesis of pyrimidine CTP and UTP takes place in the cytoplasm and begins with the formation of carbamoyl phosphate from glutamine and carbon dioxide. Next, the enzyme aspartate carbamoyl phosphate transferase catalyzes the condensation reaction between aspartate and carbamoyl phosphate to form aspartic carbamoyl acid, which is then cyclized to 4,5-acid dihydrotic with the help of the enzyme dihydroorotase. 4,5-dihydrotic acid is converted to orotate by the enzyme dihydroorotate oxidase. This reaction is: (S)-Dihydroorotate + O2 \u2192 Orotate + H2O2 Next, orotate is joined to a phosphorylated ribosyl group, via a covalent bond. The covalent bond between ribose and pyrimidine is at the 1 carbon position (C1) in the ribose group, which contains one pyrophosphate, and the 1 nitrogen position (N1), in the pyrimidine ring. Orotate phosphoribosyl transferase (PRPP transferase) catalyzes the reaction that produces orothidine monophosphate (OMP): Orotate + 5-Phospho-\u03b1-D-ribose 1-diphosphate (PRPP) \u2192 Orotidine 5'-phosphate + Pyrophosphate Orotidine 5'-monophosphate is then decarboxylated by orothidine-5'-phosphate decarboxylase to form uridine monophosphate (UMP).",

        "paragraph": "PRPP transferase catalyzes ribosylation and decarboxylation reactions, forming UMP from orotic acid in the PRPP content. Another pyrimidine nucleotide is derived from UMP. Then, UMP is phosphorylated by two enzyme kinases to form uridine triphosphate (UTP) via two sequential reactions with ATP. First, the diphosphate forming UDP is produced, and then it is phosphorylated to UTP. Both reactions use ATP for energy through ATP hydrolysis: ATP + UMP \u2192 ADP + UDP UDP + ATP \u2192 UTP + ADP Next, CTP is formed by the amination reaction of UTP through the catalytic activity of the enzyme CTP synthetase. Glutamine is an NH3 donor and the reaction uses energy through ATP hydrolysis. UTP + Glutamine + ATP + H2O \u2192 CTP + ADP + Pi Cytidine monophosphate (CMP) is derived from cytidine triphosphate (CTP) through the loss of two phosphate groups. The atoms used to build purine nucleotides come from a variety of sources: The de novo synthesis for purine nucleotides is carried out with precursors inserted into the purine ring via a 10-step pathway to the intermediate IMP compound, the nucleotide from the hypoxanthine base. AMP and GMP are further synthesized from these intermediates via a two-step separate pathway. Therefore, the purine group is initially formed as part of a ribonucleotide, and not as a free base. Six enzymes are involved in the IMP synthesis reaction. Among the enzymes, three have multifunctional roles: The reaction pathway begins with the formation of PRPP. PRPS1 is an enzyme that activates R5P, which is formed by the pentose phosphate pathway, to PRPP which is made by reaction with ATP. This reaction is unusual because the pyrophosphoryl group is transferred directly from ATP to C1 from R5P, and the compound formed has an \u03b1 configuration at C1.",

        "paragraph": "This reaction also shares with the synthesis pathways of the amino acids Trp, His and pyrimidine nucleotides. This reaction is highly regulated because it is in the main metabolism and consumes a lot of energy. In a first reaction unique only to purine nucleotide synthesis, PPAT catalyzes the transfer of the pyrophosphate (PPi) group of PRPP via the amide nitrogen group donated by glutamine (N), glycine (N and C), aspartic acid (N), folic acid (C1) or carbon dioxide. This is the committed step in purine synthesis. This reaction occurs by inverting the configuration at ribose C1, which then forms \u03b2-5-phosphoribosylamine (5-PRA) and confirms the anomeric form of the future nucleotide. Next, glycine is supplied with energy from ATP hydrolysis and the carboxyl group makes the amine bond with NH2 from before. The one-carbon unit of the folic acid coenzyme N10-formyl-THF is then added to the amine group of the substituted glycine, followed by closure of the imidazole ring. Then, the second NH2 group is transferred from the glutamine to the first carbon of the glycine group. The second one-carbon carboxylation unit of the glycine group is added together. This new carbon group is then modified by adding a third NH2 group, this time transferred from the aspartate residue. Finally, a second one-carbon unit of formyl THF is added to the nitrogen group and the ring is covalently closed to form the common purine precursor inosine monophosphate (IMP) group. Inosine monophosphate is converted to adenosine monophosphate in two steps. First, hydrolysis of GTP provides the energy for adding aspartate to IMP by the enzyme adenylosuccinate synthase, replacing the carbonyl oxygen with nitrogen and forming the intermediate adenylosuccinate. Then, fumarate is cleaved to form adenosine monophosphate. This step is catalyzed by the enzyme adenylosuccinate lyase. Inosine monophosphate is converted to guanosine monophosphate through the oxidation reaction of IMP to form xantilate, followed by the insertion of an amine group at C2.",

Leah was Jacob's cousin, because she was the daughter of Laban, brother of Rebekah, Jacob's mother. In addition, Leah was also the older sister of Rachel, Jacob's second wife. Leah was born in Padan-Aram, Mesopotamia and died in the land of Canaan. Leah has other names: Laiya, Li'ah, Lay'ah, and Elijah. At the first meeting with Jacob, according to the Book of Genesis chapter 29 it is described about Leah and Rachel, his sister, as follows: The word \"Leah did not shine her eyes\" according to the original language is Hebrew: \u05d5\u05e2\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9 \u05dc\u05d0\u05d4 \u05e8\u05db\u05d5\u05ea\u200e (we\u00b7'ei\u00b7nei le\u00b7' ah ra\u00b7ko\u00b7wt). The word \"rakowt\" in Hebrew usually means \"soft\", but its meaning in this verse is disputed. The Septuagint Bible (from the 2nd century BC) translates this word into Greek as asthenes (weak; sickly). The King James version of the English Bible uses the word \"tender\" (=soft, soft, weak), while the New International version uses the word \"weak\". There is also a translation that translates as \"blue or pale in color\". Commentary by Jewish rabbi Rashi cites a Rabbinic interpretation of how Leah's eyes became weak. In this story it is written that people said, \"Laban had 2 daughters, while his sister, Rebekah, had 2 sons.

According to this story, God finally heard Leah's tears and prayers, allowing her to marry Jacob, even before Jacob married Rachel. Jacob loved Rachel, so he said: \"I want to work for you seven years to get Rachel, your younger daughter.\" Laban replied: \"I would rather give it to you than to anyone else; then stay with me.\" So Jacob worked 7 years to get Rachel, but the 7 years he considered as just a few days, because of his love for Rachel. After that Jacob said to Laban, \"Give me my future wife, for my term is fulfilled, so that I will marry her.\" Then Laban invited everyone in the place and gave a banquet.

When the Lord saw that Leah was not loved, He opened her womb, but Rachel was barren. Then Leah gave birth to 6 sons and a daughter. This is the story of the birth of Leah's children: 1.

The historical context in the use of the term is the Vedic period (1700\u2013600 BC), Mahajanapada (600 BC) and the areas after the Mauryan Empire (322 BC), which marked the beginning of the golden age of classical Sanskrit literature. Many things about the political situation and geographical conditions of Bharatakhanda can be seen in the Mahabharata. The Ramayana can also provide some information. Before the existence of the Mahabharata, the Rigveda described the political situation and natural conditions in ancient India. After the Mahabharata era ended, following the emergence of the Purana era, namely the period of writing mythological books, which also described the political and geographical situation around India at that time. In Hindu literature, Bharatakhanda or Bharataksetra is a designation for an inhabited world; continents and landmasses as far as the Sanskrit poets know. A term similar to this understanding is Bharatawarsha. Usually, Bharatakhanda is used to refer to mainland India (South Asia, especially the center of Vedic-based culture) in ancient times, while Bharatawarsha is a term with a wider range, which is used to refer to Greater India (including areas that have been influenced by South Asia, namely parts of Asia West and Southeast Asia).

In prehistoric India, political science is believed to have emerged with the writing of the first Veda, namely the Rigveda (around 1500 BC). The kingdom in the Ramayana appears around 500 BC and in the Mahabharata around 400 BC. The existence of these kingdoms ended when the emergence of the Maurya Kingdom in 321 BC. Borders between kingdoms were rarely fences or walls with guard posts. Borders are often used as natural areas such as rivers, forests, mountains and valleys. The river is often used as a border for two adjacent kingdoms. Sometimes, there was a wilderness that was wider than the kingdom itself and was made a border area. Mountains like Himalaya, Windhya and Sahya are also used as natural boundaries.

The king also gives justice and punishment for people who break the rules. There are no border posts between kingdoms and disputes over boundaries are rare. A king usually makes an army (usually called Digvijaya which means victor over all leaders) and conquers other kingdoms in a battle, lasting quickly or it could be for days.

Because of this property, the topology is also called rubber geometry. It emerged through the development of concepts from geometry and set theory, such as space, dimension, shape, and transformation. The ideas now classified under topology had been stated since 1736, and in the late 19th century a distinctly separate science was developed. This science was called in Latin as site geometry (\"geometry of places\") or site analysis (Greek-Latin for \"study of places\"), and it later acquired the modern name of topology. In the middle of the 20th century, topology has become one of the main branches of mathematics. The word topology is used both for a branch of mathematics and for the family of sets with some properties used to define a topological space, the basic object of topology. Some of the important ones are homeomorphisms which can be defined as a continuous function with an inverse also. For example, the function y = 3x is a homeomorphism from the real number line to itself. Topology covers many subfields. The most basic and traditional sections of topology are: Some of the most active fields, such as low-dimensional topology and graph theory, don't fit neatly into this division. The motivating insight behind topology is that some geometric problems depend not on the exact shape of the objects involved, but rather on the way they are put together. For example, a square and a circle have many properties in common: they are both one-dimensional objects (from a topological point of view) and they both separate the plane into two parts, an inner and an outer part.",

These results do not depend on the length of the bridges or their distance from each other, but only on the property of connectivity: which bridge connects to which island or riverbank. The Seven K\u00f6nigsberg Bridges Problem led to the branch of mathematics known as graph theory. Similarly, the hairy ball theorem of topology algebra says that \"one cannot brush hair flat on a hairy ball without licking the hair.\" This fact immediately convinces most people, even though they may not recognize the statement of the more formal theorem, that there is no continuous non-disappearing tangent vector field on a sphere. As with the K\u00f6nigsberg Bridge, the result is independent of the shape of the ball; this applies to any type of fine lump, as long as there are no voids. In order to deal with this problem that does not depend on the exact shape of the object, we need to be clear about what properties this problem does depend on. From this need comes the notion of homeospheric. The impossibility of crossing each bridge only once holds for any bridge arrangement that is homeomorphic to that of K\u00f6nigsberg, and the hairy ball theorem holds for any space that is homeomorphic to a sphere. Intuitively, two spaces are homeomorphic if one can deform into the other without cutting or gluing.

This is harder to explain without technicalities, but the basic idea is that two objects are homotopic equivalents if they both resulted from \"squeezing\" a larger object. The introductory exercise is to classify the uppercase letters of the Indonesian alphabet according to the equations of homeomorphism and homotopy. The result depends on the font used, and whether the strokes that make up the letters have thickness or ideal curves without thickness. The image here uses the Myriad sans-serif font and is assumed to consist of ideal curves without thickness. Homotopy equality is a grosser relation than homeomorphism; a homotopy equivalence class can contain multiple homeomorphism classes. The simple case of homotopy equations described above can be used here to denote two homotopy equivalent letters. For example, the OF fits inside the P and the tail of the P can be clipped into the \"eyelet\". Homeomorphism classes are: Homotopy classes are larger, because their tails can be squished down to a point. They: To classify letters correctly, we must show that two letters in the same class are equivalent and two letters in different classes are not equivalent. In the case of homeomorphism, this can be done by selecting a point and denoting its deletion breaking letters differently. For example, X and Y are not homeomorphic because removing the midpoint of X leaves four; whatever point in Y corresponds to this point, its removal can leave at most three parts. The homotopy equivalence case is more difficult and requires more complicated arguments showing that algebraic invariations, such as fundamental groups, are different in classes that should be different.

Among them are some of the questions in geometry investigated by Leonhard Euler. The 1736 paper on the Seven Bridges of K\u00f6nigsberg is considered one of the first practical applications of topology. On November 14, 1750, Euler wrote to a friend that he had realized the importance of the edges of a polyhedron. This leads to the polyhedron formula, V \u2212 E + F = 2 (where V, E, and F denote the number of vertices, edges, and faces of the polyhedron, respectively). Some authorities consider this analysis to be the first theorem, which heralded the birth of topology. Further contributions were made by Augustin-Louis Cauchy, Ludwig Schl\u00e4fli, Johann Benedict Listing, Bernhard Riemann and Enrico Betti. Listing introduced the term \"Topologie\" in Vorstudien zur Topologie, written in his native German, in 1847, after using the word for ten years in correspondence before its first appearance in prin. The English form \"topology\" was used in 1883 in Listing's obituary in the journal Nature to distinguish \"qualitative geometry from ordinary geometry in which it is quantitative geometry. Their work was corrected, consolidated, and greatly expanded by Henri Poincar\u00e9. In 1895, he published his groundbreaking paper on Site Analysis, which introduced the concepts now known as homotopy and homology, which are now considered part of algebraic topology.Combining the work on function spaces by Georg Cantor, Vito Volterra, Cesare Arzel\u00e0, Jacques Hadamard, Giulio Ascoli and others, Maurice Fr\u00e9chet introduced spaces A metric space is now considered a special case of a general topological space, with any given topological space potentially giving rise to many different metric spaces.",

Today, topological spaces are a slight generalization of Hausdorff spaces, given in 1922 by Kazimierz Kuratowski. Modern topology relies heavily on the ideas of set theory, developed by Georg Cantor in the late 19th century. In addition to establishing the basic ideas of set theory, Cantor considered sets of points in Euclidean space as part of his study of Fourier series. For further developments, see point-set topology and algebraic topology. Topology can be defined as: Topology is concerned with the study of the topological properties of shapes, i.e. the properties that do not change in a one-to-one bicontinuous transformation (called homeomorphism). Two shapes that can be deformed from one into the other are called homeomorphic, and are considered to be the same from a topological view. For example, a solid cube and a solid sphere are homeomorphic. However, it is not possible to deform a sphere into a circle by a one-to-one bicontinuous transformation. Dimensions are a topological property. In a sense, a topological property is a deeper form property. The term topology is also used for a very basic mathematical idea in a branch of mathematics called topology. In simple terms, a topology provides a description of how the members in a set are related to each other spatially (eg the proximity between 2 points). The same set can also be given a different topology. For example, the real number line, the complex plane, and the Cantor set can be considered as the same set but with different topologies (all three have the same cardinality). Formally, let X be a set and \u03c4 is a family of subsets of X.

In the field of topology, a homeomorphism or topological isomorphism (from the Greek, homeos = identical and morphe = form) is a special isomorphism between topological spaces that satisfy topological properties. Two spaces with homeomorphism between them are called homeomorphic. From a topology review they are the same. The definition of isomorphism itself is the apparent resemblance between two creatures that actually have different origins and different classes. Roughly speaking, a topological space is a geometric object and homeomorphism is the continuous stretching and bending of an object into objects of new shape. So square and circle are homeomorphic. In topology review, the single-handled cup and the donut are the same. In topology and related fields of mathematics, a topological property or topological invariant is a property of a topological space that is invariant in homeomorphism. If given two topological spaces X and Y and the homeomorphism f between them, the topological property for a subset A of X holds if and only if it holds for f(A).

Gamelan is a multi-timbre ensemble consisting of metallophones, idiophones, xylophones, aerophones, chordophones, vocal sounds, plucked siters and hand-played membranophones called kendhang, controlling the tempo and rhythm of the pieces and the transitions from one part to another. Some of the instruments that make up today's gamelan are shown below: Kempul Gong Kenong Bonang Demung Saron Peking Gend\u00e8r Slenthem Kendang Gambang Kethuk/Kempyang Siter or Celempung Rebab Suling or Seruling Kemanak The types of gamelan are distinguished by the collection of instruments and the use of sound, tuning scales ( tunings), repertoire, style, and cultural context.",

Metamorphism occurs when the original rock (protolith) is exposed to a physical or chemical environment that is significantly different from the environment in which it was formed, so that the rock changes gradually until a state of equilibrium with the new environment is reached. The main factors that influence the process of metamorphism are as follows: The main source of heat that affects the process of metamorphism is magma intrusion and geothermal gradients. There are two kinds of pressure that affect it, namely lithostatic pressure and differential stress. Fluids accelerate the process of metamorphism by increasing chemical reactions, because fluids generally contain dissolved ions. This metamorphism occurs in areas of orogenic belts or convergent plates, which contain deformation processes that cause recrystallization. In general, this metamorphism produces rocks with mineral grains that are oriented and form belts that are hundreds to thousands of kilometers long. Orogenic metamorphism in which extensive deformation occurs simultaneously, resulting from contraction stress during lithospheric plate convergence in subduction zones and recrystallization due to increasingly thickened crust. The increase in temperature in the orogenic occurs due to a geothermal gradient that adapts to a crust that gradually thickens under pressure. In general the temperature is high enough at the bottom of the crust to cause partial melting. Because this process occurs, magma will rise to the shallow crust and precipitate as a granitoid. Orogenic usually evolve over hundreds of millions of years through several episodes of deformation and recrystallization. Contact metamorphism occurs in rocks that are heated in the vicinity of intrusive or extrusive igneous rock mass contacts.",

This fish is one of the first fish successfully domesticated, reared and cultivated by humans. Now ornamental goldfish or sometimes referred to briefly as goldfish, is one of the most popular aquarium ornamental fish. The Carassius auratus auratus variety which has been domesticated and displays a mutation of the body with double tail fins and a rounded compressed shape is called the goldfish. As a member of the carp family (which also includes koi and crucian carp), the ornamental carp is a domesticated version of the cultivation of the less colorful Carassius auratus fish whose natural habitat is in East Asia. This fish was first domesticated in China over a thousand years ago, and since then several different breeds have been developed. There is an incredible variety of goldfish in terms of size, body shape, fin arrangement and color (various color combinations include white, yellow, orange, red, brown and black). In Indonesia the term \"goldfish\" also refers to common carp or \"carp fish\" (Cyprinus carpio), which are relatives of fish that can be consumed as food. Carp rearing began in Ancient China thousands of years ago. Several species of carp (commonly known as \"Asian carp\") are being domesticated and reared as a food source through aquaculture. Naturally in nature, these fish are gray or silver in color, but some types have a tendency to experience color mutations by producing red, orange or yellow. This phenomenon was first recorded during the Jin Dynasty (265\u2013420).",

A genetic mutation in human domesticated goldfish produces a golden color (yellowish orange to be precise), whereas in nature this fish usually only displays a gray-silver color. This happens because in nature, the mutation that produces this yellow-orange color rarely occurs, because fish with this bright color are easy for predators to hunt; it is fish with natural camouflage that survive. The Chinese began breeding and cultivating varieties of goldfish rather than silvery ones, raising them in ponds rather than letting them in rivers or lakes. On special occasions at which they were expecting guests the goldfish would be transferred from the pond to a smaller container for display to their guests. By the Song dynasty (960\u20131279), efforts to domesticate carp had settled. In 1162, a Song dynasty queen ordered the construction of ponds to collect the red and yellow varieties of goldfish. At that time the general public outside the royal family was forbidden to raise goldfish of the golden (yellow) color variety, because yellow was the color of the Chinese empire. Perhaps because of this, there are now more orange and red goldfish than yellow goldfish, even though yellow goldfish are genetically easier to breed. During the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), ornamental carp began to be kept indoors, this led to a selection of genetic mutations which caused some varieties of this fish to be unable to survive in outdoor ponds. The appearance of other colors (besides red and gold) is first recorded in 1276.",

In 1611, the ornamental carp was introduced to Portugal and from there it spread to other parts of Europe. In the 1620s, goldfish were favored and regarded as prestigious in Europe because of their golden metallic yellow scales which symbolized good luck. At that time it was tradition for a husband to give a goldfish as a gift on his first wedding anniversary, as a symbol of prosperity in the years to come together. This tradition later disappeared due to ornamental goldfish becoming cheaper and easier to obtain, thus losing its status and prestige. Ornamental goldfish were introduced to North America around 1850 and soon became popular in the United States. In China, the carp was bred from the Prussian carp (Carassius auratus gibelio), and is genetically the closest living relative of the carp in the wild. Previously there was an opinion that the Crucian carp (Carassius carassius) as a wild version of the goldfish. However, the two differ in several respects, for example the muzzle of C. auratus is more pointed, while the snout of C. carassius is more rounded. C. gibelio is often gray-green in color, while the Crucian carp is always a golden bronze color. If the Crucian carp chicks have black spots on the base of the tail which will disappear with age, in C. auratus these tail spots never appear. C. auratus has less than 31 scales along the lateral line of the body, while the Crucian carp has 33 or more scales. In nature, C. auratus gibelio is olive green.",

Within three spawning generations, generally the majority of hybrid offspring switch back to olive green in color. The mutations that gave rise to other types of domestic carp also occur in other cyprinide species, such as common carp and tench. Koi may also interbreed with goldfish to produce hybrid fish that are sterile (sterile). There are many varieties of domestic goldfish. Ornamental fish are unlikely to survive in the wild due to their bright colors and long fins; however, more resistant varieties such as Shubunkin and Komet survived long enough to mate with their relatives. Common and Comet goldfish varieties can survive, even thrive in any climate and pond environment.

They cannot consciously stop eating on purpose. Overfeeding can harm the health of these fish, such as blocking their intestines. This usually occurs in ornamental goldfish that have a convoluted digestive tract. If food is abundant, they will eat it all and produce quite a lot of waste. This is generally due to the imperfection of goldfish in digesting protein. Overfeeding can be diagnosed by examining the length of the droppings coming out of the fish's cloaca. Special goldfish diets contain less protein and more carbohydrates than general fish feeds. This type of food is sold in the form of floating chips and sinking pellets. Carp enthusiasts can add a variety of foods in the form of green peas that have been peeled off, vegetables scalded with hot water, or mosquito larvae. Goldfish puppies can be given small shrimp food. Goldfish eyesight is the most studied field in the study of fish vision. Goldfish even have the ability to see color better than humans. Goldfish have four kinds of light-receiving cones, each of which is sensitive to a different color: red, green, blue, and ultraviolet. The ability to distinguish the four primary colors makes the goldfish a tetrachromatic animal. Selective breeding over the centuries has produced several colors. Several colored varieties are so different from the golden color of the original ancestral fish. There are also differences in body shape, fins, and eye configuration.

Some varieties include: Goldfish can only grow when they reach sexual maturity with enough water and proper nutrition. Most ornamental goldfish breed in fish farming spawning, particularly in spawning ponds. Breeding usually occurs after significant temperature changes, particularly in spring. Male goldfish will chase a female that is in heat and is carrying a lot of eggs, and pressures the female to release her eggs by grazing and bumping them. When they mate they release eggs and sperm together by swimming side by side together so that the eggs are fertilized. Goldfish, like most of their siprinide relatives, are spawners. The eggs have a layer that is attached, sticky to dense aquatic plants, for example Cabomba or Elodea or a kind of broom, straw or palm fiber as a spawning ground. The eggs will hatch in 48 to 72 hours. Within a few weeks, the embryo begins to reach its final form. It takes a year to reach the full adult growth rate.

Pornography is different from erotica. It can be said, pornography is an extreme/vulgar form of erotica. Erotica itself is the physical elaboration of the concepts of eroticism. The pornography industry often uses the term erotica with euphemistic motives but results in confusion among the general public. Pornography can use a variety of media \u2014 written and spoken text, photographs, engravings, drawings, moving images (including animation), and sounds such as the sound of someone gasping for breath. Pornographic films incorporate moving pictures, spoken erotic text and/or other erotic sounds, while magazines often incorporate photographs and written text. Novels and short stories feature written text, sometimes with illustrations. A live show can also be called porn. In its original meaning, pornography literally means \"writing about prostitutes\", from the classical Greek roots \"\u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03bd\u03b7\" (porne) and \"\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd\" (graphein).

In Ponorogo itself, there is the flying Ponoragan art which still uses Kompang percussion from small to large sizes. Apart from Kompang, the flying art is also accompanied by Reog musical instruments, such as the Reog drum and the Reog gamelan. Apart from that, Kompang in Ponorogo is still used in religious activities for the Javanese Muslim community such as ba'an, weddings, celebrations of Islamic holidays, to official ceremonies. The number of traditional pesantren in Ponorogo which are well-known, made the alumni of the Islamic boarding school in Ponorogo bring the Kompang musical instrument to various regions on the island of Java which was then developed in each area by the alumni of the santri. Kompang Ponorogo also spread to the Malay area because of the marriage of the son of the Tegalsari Pesantren kyai married to the daughter of the Sultan of Selangor. The Delegation of the Tegalsari Islamic Boarding School brought Kompang offerings when the wedding took place, until Kompang Ponorogo was also popular with the Malay community in Selangor.",

Fasting diets (usually a minimum of 16 hours of fasting periods and 8 hours of eating periods) are gaining popularity for weight loss. During the fasting period, sugar levels decrease, so activities during the fasting period will use fat as an energy source. Food is closely related to metabolic processes. Therefore, in certain medical examinations related to metabolic processes, for example checking blood glucose levels, patients are often required to fast first. Fasting replaces damaged cells in the body and replaces them with new cells. In addition, fasting can increase growth hormone back up to 2000% in men and 1300% in women.

Compact bone is bone that is composed of tightly packed Harvesian systems or osteons. In the center the Harvesian system consists of a channel surrounded by concentric rings between the matrices. Between the lamellae are bone cells (osteocytes) located in the lacunae, which are connected to the Harvesian canals by small channels called canaliculi. Spongy bone is lighter and less dense than compact bone. The spongy bone is composed of cavities which themselves are composed of trabecular plates connected by canaliculi with small irregular spaces filled with bone marrow. Trabeculae and cavities are arranged loosely and irregularly but their structure actually functions to maximize bone strength, in which these structures can adapt to physical stress on the bones and are not rigid.

The term \"Antichrist\" (including the plural) occurs five times in the New Testament, namely in the first and second letters of John. The Antichrist is characterized as \"he who denies both the Father and the Son.\" The term pseudochrist or \"false Christ\" is also found in the Gospels. In the Gospel of Matthew (chapter 24) and the Gospel of Mark (chapter 13), Jesus warns his disciples not to be deceived by false prophets who claim to be Christ while \"performing great signs and wonders\" . Three other images often associated with the Antichrist are the \"little horn\" in Daniel's final vision, the \"man of lawlessness\" in Paul's second letter to the Thessalonians, and the \"beast from the sea\" in Revelation. Antichrist is the translation of a combination of two Ancient Greek words, \u1f00\u03bd\u03c4\u03af (anti) and \u03a7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2 (Christos). In Greek, \u03a7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2 means \"anointed one\". The word \u1f00\u03bd\u03c4\u03af does not only mean \"anti\" in the sense of \"against\" or \"the opposite of\", but also in the sense of \"instead of\". The word \"antichrist\" comes from the original Koine Greek \"\u1f00\u03bd\u03c4\u03af\u03c7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2\" antichrist.

His thoughts contributed to the formation of the way of life of the Jewish people at the end of the first century until now in the 21st century. Gamaliel was also the teacher of the Apostle Paul. Gamaliel was the grandson of Hillel, who was nicknamed \"The Elder\", who had developed the thoughts that became the forerunners of the Pharisees. Hillel's teaching method is considered softer than that of his rival teaching figure, Shamai. After the Jerusalem Temple was destroyed in AD 70, Bet Hillel (House of Hillel) was favored over Bet Shamai (House of Shamai). The House of Hillel became the official representative of Judaism, as all other sects disappeared with the destruction of the Temple. The decisions of Bet Hillel were often the basis for Jewish law in the Mishnah, which became the foundation of the Talmud, and Gamaliel's influence seems to have been a major factor in the domination of the House of Hillel. Gamaliel was so revered that he was the first to be called rabban, a higher title than rabbi. After a time, Gamaliel became such a respected man that the Mishnah said of him,\u00a0:\"When Raban Gamaliel the elder died, the glory of the Torah ended, and purity and holiness disappeared\" (Sotah 9:15). The Apostle Paul told the crowds in Jerusalem that he was educated at Gamaliel's feet. As Professor Dov Zlotnick of the Jewish Theological Seminary in the United States writes, \"The accuracy of the oral law, hence the reliability of the law, depends almost entirely on the relationship between teacher and student: the attention paid by the teacher in teaching the law and the intent of the student to learn it. . . .

He writes, \"The more famous rabbis often gathered around them large numbers of young men desirous of being taught, for the purpose of making them intimately acquainted with the various and numerous 'oral laws'. . . . The teaching consists of continuous tireless training of the memory. . . . The teacher posed several questions about the law to his students whose decisions they had to make and let them give the answers or he answered them himself. Students were also allowed to ask questions of the teacher.\u201d From the rabbis' point of view, what was at stake for the students was far more important than receiving a passing mark. Those who studied under such teachers were warned, \u201cWhoever alone who forgets one thing of what he has learned\u2014according to the Scriptures, it is a matter of life or death.\u201d (Avot 3:8) The greatest praise goes to the student who is like \u201ca well plastered with plaster, that loses not a drop of even water.\u201d (Avot 2:8) It was this type of training that Paul, then known by his Hebrew name Saul, received from Gamaliel. In harmony with the teachings of the Pharisees, Gamaliel encouraged belief in the oral law. greater to the rabbinical traditions than to the inspired Scriptures.

According to Gamaliel, only in this way can one avoid sinning. (Compare with Romans 14:1-12). However, basically Gamaliel was known for his more tolerant and liberal attitude in his decisions regarding religious law. For example, he showed consideration for women when he decided that he \"allows a wife to remarry on the basis of the testimony of one witness regarding her husband's death.\" (Yevamot 16:7) Also, to protect those who are divorced, Gamaliel introduced a number of restrictions on the issuance of divorce papers. This spirit is also seen in the way Gamaliel dealt with the early followers of Jesus Christ. The book of Acts tells that when other Jewish leaders attempted to kill Jesus' apostles whom they had arrested for preaching the Gospel, the following incident was recorded: Gamaliel's advice was accepted, and the apostles were released. Paul had been trained and educated by Gamaliel as one of the greatest rabbis of the first century. He confessed candidly about his life history when he spoke to those who were about to kill him in Jerusalem: No doubt the mention of Gamaliel the apostle caused the crowds to pay special attention to his words. But he spoke to them about a Teacher far superior to Gamaliel, namely Jesus Christ, the Messiah. Now, as a disciple of Jesus, not a disciple of Gamaliel, Paul addresses a large crowd.

Naga Taksaka also appears in Balinese mythology, due to the influence of Hindu mythology from India. in Balinese mythology, Takshaka is a snake that lives in heaven. Not all of these snakes have evil behavior. It is told in Adiparwa's story that Dewi Kadru, who had no children, asked Resi Kasyapa to bestow her with a thousand children. Then Bagawan Kasyapa gave a thousand eggs to be cared for by Dewi Kadru. Later from these eggs the sons of Dewi Kadru were born. After five hundred years, the eggs hatched. From it came the dragons. The famous dragons are Basuki, Ananta, and Taksaka. In the Mahabharata it is told that when Maharaja Parikesit from Hastinapura went hunting, he lost track of his prey and entered a Brahmin residence / hermitage. He asked a hermit named Samiti who was sitting in meditation because he was the only hermit he met. The hermit was silent when Parikshit asked. In anger, the king took the carcass of the snake with his arrow and slung it around Samiti's neck. Samiti's son, namely Sang Srenggi, felt angry at this deed. Based on the explanation of Kresa, who knew what had happened, Sang Srenggi cursed King Parikesit so that he would die from being bitten by a snake seven days after the curse was uttered. Samiti was disappointed at her son who had cursed King Parikesit. Finally he went to see the king about the curse, but King Parikesit was ashamed and preferred to protect himself from the curse.",

When the King received the guava fruit from the disguised Brahmin, Dragon Takshaka returned to his original form and bit King Parikesit. Due to the bite of the powerful Dragon, King Parikesit was burned to ashes. The son of King Parikesit was King Janamejaya. He was made king at a young age. When Sang Utangka came to see the King, he explained the cause of the death of the King's father, which was bitten by the Takshaka Dragon. To take revenge, the King held a Sarpahoma or snake sacrifice ceremony. He invited the brahmins to support the ceremony. However, the Brahmins' hunch said that later the ceremony would be thwarted by a Brahmin. During the ceremony, a fire is lit. Moments later, thousands of snakes with various shapes floated, as if being pulled towards the ceremony location and got there they were engulfed in the blazing ceremonial fire. Many snakes that enter the fire make the fire even more blazing caused by the fat of the snakes. Taksaka, who was in Nagaloka, felt worried and sent Sang Astika -- one of his nephews who is also a Brahmin -- to ask King Janamejaya to cancel the ceremony.

Subculture can occur because of differences in age, race, ethnicity, social class, gender, and/or gender of its members, and can also occur because of differences in aesthetics, religion, politics, and sexuality; or a combination of these factors. Members of a subculture usually show their membership with a lifestyle or certain symbols. Because of this, subcultural studies often include the study of symbolism (clothing, music and behavior of members of the subculture) \u2014 and how these symbols are interpreted by the host culture \u2014 in their studies. If a subculture has characteristics that are contrary to the main culture, the subculture can be classified as a counterculture. In the 1950s, David Riesman distinguished a majority group that accepted commercially existing styles and values, while subcultural groups adhered to a minority style that was the opposite. In his book entitled Subculture: The Meaning of Style, published in 1979, Dick Hebdige argued that subculture is a form of resistance to custom. Subcultures can be viewed negatively by society because of their nature which criticizes dominant social standards. In 1995, Sarah Thornton defined \"subcultural capital\" as cultural knowledge and commodities acquired by members of the subculture. This elevates their status and helps differentiate them from other group members. He compared this with the term \"cultural capital\" coined by Pierre Bourdieu. In 2007, Ken Gelder identified the generally understood subcultural characteristics of being bad at work, associations with certain places (streets, clubs), activities outside the home, rejection of common lifestyles, and so on. Sociologists Gary Alan Fine and Sherryl Kleinman in their research in 1979 showed that a subculture functions to motivate prospective members to accept the values \u200b\u200bin the subcultural group.",

The democracy practiced at that time was direct democracy, meaning that the people's right to make political decisions was carried out directly by all the people or citizens. A democratic government is different from a form of government in which the power is held by one person, such as a monarchy. Derived from the Greek philosophy today seems ambiguous because some contemporary governments mix elements of democracy, oligarchy, and monarchy. Karl Popper defined democracy as distinct from dictatorship or tyranny, thus focusing on the opportunity for a society to control its dishonest or untrustworthy leaders and remove them without needing a revolution. There are several types of democracy, but only two basic forms. Both explain how all people carry out their wishes. The first form of democracy is direct democracy, in which all citizens play a direct and active role in making government decisions. In most modern democracies, the entire people is still a sovereign power but political power is exercised indirectly through representatives; so-called indirect democracy.

The government was continued by his successors until the Romanov dynasty ascended the throne which was preceded by Michael Romanov's appointment as Tsar (1613). The Romanov dynasty ruled for 304 years until 1917 with Tsar Nikolai II as the last tsar. In February 1917 the Provisional Government was formed under Prince Lyvov and Alexander Kerensky until 25 October 1917, when it was replaced by the Bolshevik Revolutionary Government by Vladimir Ilyich Lenin. Nomadic pastoralism flourished in the Pontus-Caspian steppes beginning in the Copper Age. The ancestors of the modern Russian people are the Slavic tribes, whose original home is considered by some scholars to be the forested area of \u200b\u200bthe Pinsk Swamp. The history of Russia begins with the migration of Scandinavian nations known as the Varangians led by the semi-legendary figure Rurik who crossed the Baltic Sea and in 862 AD entered the city of Novgorod and ruled there. The Eastern Slavs gradually settled in Western Russia in two waves: one moving from Kiev towards present-day Suzdal and Murom and the other from Polotsk towards Novgorod and Rostov. From the 7th century onwards, Eastern Slavs made up the bulk of the population in Western Russia, and assimilated with the indigenous Finno-Ugric peoples, including the Merya, Muromian, and Meshchera.",

According to the Main Chronicle, a Varangian from the people of Rus, named Rurik, was elected ruler of Novgorod in 862. In 882, his successor Oleg went south and conquered Kiev, previously paying tribute to the Khazars. Oleg, Rurik's son Igor and Igor's son Sviatoslav then subdued all the local East Slavic tribes to Kievan rule, destroyed the Khazar Khaganate and launched several military expeditions to Byzantium and Persia. In the 10th to 11th centuries, Kievan Rus' became one of the largest and most prosperous nations in Europe. The reigns of Vladimir the Great (980\u20131015) and his son Yaroslav the Wise (1019\u20131054) were the Golden Age of Kiev, which saw the acceptance of Orthodox Christianity from Byzantium and the creation of the first East Slavic written legal code, Russkaya Pravda. Eventually Kievan Rus' was crushed, with the final blow being the Mongol invasion of 1237\u201340, which resulted in the destruction of Kiev, and the death of about half of Rus' population. The invaders, who became known as the Tatars, formed the Golden Horde state, which plundered the Russian empire and ruled over southern and central Russia for more than two centuries. The most powerful state that eventually emerged after the destruction of Kievan Rus' was the Grand Duchy of Moscow, originally part of Vladimir-Suzdal. While still under the Mongol-Tatar domain and with their resolve, Moscow began to assert its influence in Middle Rus in the early 14th century, gradually becoming a major force in the process of reunification and expansion of the Russian 'Rus land'. Moscow's final rival, the Novgorod Republic, prospered as a major fur trading center and the Hanseatic League's easternmost port.",

Ivan III (\"the great\") eventually relinquished control of the Golden Horde and consolidated all of Central and Northern Rus under Moscow rule. He was also the first to bear the title \"Grand Prince of All Russia\". After the fall of Constantinople in 1453, Moscow claimed succession to its inheritance from the Eastern Roman Empire. Ivan III married Sophia Palaiologina, niece of the last Byzantine emperor, Constantine XI, and made the Byzantine double-headed eagle his own, and eventually became the coat of arms of Russia. Developing the ideas of the Third Rome, Grand Duke Ivan IV (the \"Terrible\") was formally crowned Russia's first Tsar in 1547. The tsar promulgated a new code of laws (Sudebnik 1550), established Russia's first feudal representative body (Zemsky Sobor) and introduced local self-management to rural areas. During his long reign, Ivan the Terrible nearly doubled Russia's already vast territory by annexing three Tatar khanates (part of the destroyed Golden Horde): Kazan and Astrakhan along the Volga River, and the Siberian Khanate in southwestern Siberia. Thus, by the end of the 16th century, Russia was turning into a multiethnic, multidenominational and transcontinental state. The death of Ivan's son marked the end of the ancient Rurik dynasty in 1598, and combined with the famine of 1601\u201303, led to civil war, sham rule, and foreign intervention during the Time of Troubles in the early 17th century.

Russian explorers pushed eastward mainly along the Siberian River Route, and by the mid-17th century there were Russian settlements in Eastern Siberia, on the Chukchi Peninsula, along the Amur River, and on the Pacific coast. In 1648, Fedot Popov and Semyon Dezhnyov, two Russian explorers, became the first Europeans to sail through the Bering Strait to North America. Under Peter the Great, Russia declared itself an Empire in 1721 and became a world power.

On the Baltic Sea, Peter founded a new capital city which he named Saint Petersburg. Peter the Great's reforms brought western European cultural influences to Russia.

Together with its alliances with several European countries, Russia fought against Napoleon. The French invasion of Russia during the heyday of Napoleon in 1812 was a complete failure for France. The combination of fierce Russian resistance coupled with the bitter cold of winter meant that 95% of the Grande Arm\u00e9e's pan-European troops were killed.

The rebellion was suppressed, but the government was forced to undertake major reforms, including granting freedom of speech and freedom of assembly, legalization of political parties, and the creation of an elected legislature for the Russian Imperial Duma. Stolypin's agrarian reforms led to a massive migration of peasants and occupation to Siberia. More than 4 million people arrived in the region between 1906 and 1914.

However, massive public distrust combined with rising war costs, large numbers of troops being killed, and rumors of corruption eventually led to the Russian Revolution of 1917.

The monarchy was replaced by a coalition of political parties calling itself the Provisional Government. In addition to the provisional government, a group of socialists set up a separate group called the Petrograd Soviet, uniting forces through a democratically elected council called the Soviet.

Chebyshev's students included Aleksandr Lyapunov, who founded the modern theory of stability, and Andrey Markov, who discovered the Markov chain. In the 20th century, Soviet mathematicians such as Andrey Kolmogorov, Israel Gelfand, and Sergey Sobolev made major contributions to the field of mathematics. 9 Soviet/Russian mathematicians won the Fields Medal, the most prestigious award in mathematics.

Ideology can be thought of as a comprehensive vision, as a way of looking at things (compare Weltanschauung), in general (see Ideology in everyday life) and several philosophical directions (see Political ideology), or a group of ideas put forward by the dominant class to all members Public. The main aim behind ideology is to offer change through a normative thought process. Ideology is an abstract system of thought (not just the formation of ideas) that is applied to public matters, thus making this concept the core of politics. Implicitly every political thought follows an ideology even though it is not placed as an explicit system of thinking. (definition of ideology of Marxism). The word Ideology was first introduced by the French philosopher Destutt de Tracy in 1796. This word comes from the French id\u00e9ologie, which is a combination of 2 words, namely, id\u00e9o which refers to ideas and logie which refers to logos, the Greek word for explaining logic and reason. . Destutt de Tracy uses this word in its etymological sense, as \"a science which includes the study of the origin and nature of ideas or ideas\". Definitions do matter. That's why Ibnu Sina once commented: Because according to him, it is as important as a syllogism (read: correct logic of thinking) for every proposition (postulate or statement) that we make.

Broadly speaking, it can be concluded that ideology (mabda') is a thought that includes a fundamental conception of life and has methods for rationalizing these thoughts in the form of facts, methods of keeping these thoughts from becoming absurd from other thoughts and methods for spreading them. In the social sciences, political ideology is a set of ideas and principles that explain how society should work, and offer a certain summary of societal orders. Political ideology usually concerns itself with how to organize power and how it should be implemented. The communist theory of Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels and their followers, often known as Marxism, is considered the most influential and fully described political ideology of the 20th century. Examples of other ideologies include: anarchism, capitalism, communism, communitarianism, conservatism, neoliberalism, Islamic democracy, democracy Christianity, Fascism, Monarchism, Nationalism, Nazism, Liberalism, Libertarianism, Socialism and Social Democracy. The popularity of ideology is due to the influence of \"moral entrepreneurs\", who sometimes act with their own ends.

In the early 1930's, drastic measures to tighten the Soviet penal policy led to a significant increase in the number of inmates in the internment camps. During the Great Terror (1937-1938), mostly arbitrary mass detentions led to another large increase in the number of prisoners. In recent years, hundreds of thousands of people were arrested and sentenced to long prison terms under one of the various paragraphs of the famous Article 58 of the Criminal Code of the Republics of the Soviet Union, which defines punishment for various forms of \"counter-revolutionary activity.\" The hypothesis that economic considerations are responsible for causing arrests, for example during the time of Stalinism, has been refuted on the basis of ex-Soviet archives that have been opened since the 1990s. Although some archival sources also tend to support the economic hypothesis. However, the development of the camp system followed economic lines. (For the \"corrective work colonies\" this was lax, for special settlements almost nonexistent.) The growth of the camp system coincided with the culmination of the Soviet industrialization campaign. Because of this, most of the camps were set up to accommodate the large number of prisoners placed on specific economic assignments. This includes natural resources and the colonization of remote areas, as well as the realization of massive infrastructure facilities and industrial development projects. In 1931-1932, the Gulag had an estimated 200,000 prisoners in camps. In 1935 \u2014 about 800,000 in camps and 300,000 in colonies (annual average).

The death rate peaked in 1942\u20131943. After World War II the number of prisoners in prison camps and colonies again increased sharply, reaching about 2.5 million in the early 1950s (about 1.7 million of these were in camps).

Tens of thousands of them were eventually found guilty and transferred to detention camps. Large numbers of civilians from Russian territories occupied by other countries and areas annexed by the Soviet Union after the war were also sent there. It was not uncommon for survivors of the Nazi camps to be sent directly to Soviet labor camps. However, the main reason for the increase in the number of prisoners in the post-war period was the tightening of laws on property infringement in the summer of 1947 (at this time there was a famine in several regions of the USSR, which resulted in the death of 1 million people), which resulted in hundreds of thousands of people being sentenced to prison terms. long prison terms, not infrequently for petty theft or embezzlement.

The amnesty program that was introduced was limited to those who had been detained for a maximum of 5 years, so that mostly only those who committed ordinary crimes were released. The release of political prisoners began in 1954 and became widespread, and was accompanied by mass rehabilitation, after Nikita Khrushchev rejected Stalinism in his Secret Speech at the 20th Congress of the CPI in February, 1956.

Logging and mining are the most common and one of the most strenuous activities. At a Gulag mine, one person's production (norm) quota might be as high as 13,000 kg of iron ore per day, with the quota being increased by tufta (\"pretend work\"), so that more work will be reported than what is actually done, and achieved through bribes, courtship, sexual favors or fraud. Failure to meet the quota will result in the loss of important rations (reduced to 300 grams of \"black rye bread\", 5 grams of flour, 25 grams of buckwheat or macaroni, 27 grams of meat and 170 grams of potatoes). Lower food rations mean lower productivity, and this vicious cycle usually results in fatal consequences through states of debility and devitalization, nicknamed \"dokhodiaga\" (\u0434\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434\u044f\u0433\u0430), a term derived from the Russian verb \"dokhodit\" (reach (endurance limit)) and translates approximately as \"hopeless person\".

The nutritional value of the daily food ration is about 1,200 calories (5,000 kilojoules), mainly of low-quality bread distributed by weight. According to the World Health Organization, the minimum requirement for hard work is between 3,100\u20133,900 calories (13,000 to 16,300 kJ) per day. The administrators routinely stole from the camp various necessities for his personal use, and to please his superiors.

In the early days of the Gulag, the locations for the camps were chosen primarily for the convenience of isolating the prisoners. Remote monasteries in particular were often used as sites for new camps. The site on the Solovetsky Islands in the White Sea is one of the earliest and also most noteworthy, taking root soon after the Revolution in 1918.

Many more projects during the rapid industrialization of the 1930s, the wartime and post-war years were carried out on the backs of prisoners, and the activities of the Gulag camps stretched across the vast Soviet industry. Most of the Gulag camps were located in very remote areas in northeastern Siberia (the best-known clusters were the Sevvostlag (Northeast Camps) along the Kolyma River and Norillag near Norilsk) and in the southeastern parts of the Soviet Union, especially in the steppes of Kazakhstan (Luglag, Steplag, Peschanlag).

Not all camps were fortified; in fact some of the camps in Siberia were marked only by outposts. Escape attempts were hindered by the violent elements, as well as the sniffer dogs stationed at each camp. While in the 1920s and 1930s native tribes often assisted escapees, many of the tribes also fell victim to fleeing thieves. Tempted by the generous bounty, they then started assisting the government in capturing the Gulag fugitives. Camp guards were also given tough incentives to guard their prisoners at any cost. If a prisoner escaped under the watch of a guard, the guard would often lose his uniform and become an inmate himself in the Gulag. Furthermore, if an escaped detainee was shot, the guards could be fined an amount that was often the equivalent of a week's or two weeks' wages. In some cases, teams of prisoners were sent to a new area with a limited supply of resources and left to set up a new camp or die. Sometimes this attempt is made several times before the next wave of colonists can withstand the elements. The area along the Indigirka River is known as the Gulag within the Gulag. In 1926, the village of Oimiakon (\u041e\u0439\u043c\u044f\u043a\u043e\u043d) in this region recorded a low temperature of \u221271.2\u00b0C.

These writings, particularly those of Solzhenitsyn, harshly criticized the Soviet people for their tolerant and apathetic attitude towards the Gulag, but at the same time testified to the courage and determination of those detained. Another cultural phenomenon in the Soviet Union associated with the Gulag was the forced migration of many artists and other cultural figures to Siberia. This gave birth to a kind of Renaissance in places like Magadan, where, for example, the quality of theatrical production was comparable to that of Moscow. Soviet state documents show that among the goals of the GULAG was the colonization of the sparsely populated interior areas. To achieve this goal, the notion of \"free settlement\" was introduced.

Together with the Archaea domain, bacteria are classified as prokaryotes. Bacterial cells have a specific shape, such as a ball, rod or spiral, which is usually a few micrometers in size. Bacteria were one of the first forms of life to appear and currently inhabit the majority of habitats on Earth. Bacteria can live in soil, water, acidic hot springs, radioactive waste, to the Earth's crust. Bacteria also establish symbiotic relationships with plants and animals. Most of the bacteria are unknown, and only about 27 percent of the bacterial phyla have species that can be grown in the laboratory. The study of bacteria is called bacteriology, a branch of microbiology. Almost all animals depend on bacteria for their survival because only bacteria and some archaea have the genes and enzymes necessary to synthesize vitamin B12. This vitamin is obtained by animals through the food chain or produced by microorganisms that live in their digestive system. There are about 40 million bacterial cells in one gram of soil and one million bacterial cells in one milliliter of fresh water. Altogether, there are about 4\u20136 x 1030 bacteria and archaea on Earth, which form a biomass surpassed only by plants. Bacteria play an important role in the nutrient cycle, for example in the process of fixing nitrogen from the atmosphere and decomposing corpses. In communities of organisms around hydrothermal vents and cold vents, extremophile bacteria provide the nutrients needed to sustain life by converting dissolved compounds, such as hydrogen sulfide and methane, into energy.",

However, several species of bacteria are pathogenic and cause infectious diseases, including cholera, syphilis, gonorrhea, anthrax, leprosy, and the plague. The most commonly found deadly bacterial disease is respiratory tract infection. Tuberculosis kills around two million people a year, mostly in Sub-Saharan Africa. Antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections and are also used in agriculture, which has made antibiotic resistance a growing problem. In the industrial sector, bacteria play an important role in the treatment of waste and the decomposition of oil spills, the production of cheese and yoghurt through fermentation, the refining of gold, palladium, copper and other metals in the mining sector, as well as in biotechnology such as the manufacture of antibiotics and other chemicals. Bacteria are microscopic organisms that are difficult to detect, especially before the invention of the microscope. This organism was first observed in 1676 by Antony van Leeuwenhoek, a Dutch trader and scientist. He used a single-lens microscope he designed himself. Leeuwenhoek then published his observations in a series of letters to the Royal Society of London, which were published in English in 1684. Bacteria were objects within the limits of what Leeuwenhoek's simple lens could see and no one else could see them for over a century. Leeuwenhoek also observed protozoa, all of which he referred to as \"small animals\". Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg, German scientist, introduced the word bacterium in 1838.

He found that a number of bacteria form endospores that are resistant to high temperatures, including Bacillus which is able to switch from a vegetative form to an endospore and vice versa. Cohn also initiated the grouping of bacteria based on their shape (spherical, rods, filaments, and spirals) and developed several methods to prevent contamination of bacterial cultures, such as using cotton as a cover for test tubes. Louis Pasteur, a French chemist, discovered that heating killed or deactivated bacteria and other microorganisms in wine so that the wine was less perishable and had a longer shelf life. This method was later called pasteurization. In the period from 1859 to 1864, Pasteur disproved the concept of spontaneous formation through his experiments which later became widely accepted. Together with his contemporary, Robert Koch, Pasteur was an early supporter of the germ theory of disease. At that time, microorganisms were known to cause infectious diseases. However, there was no definitive evidence to support this theory until Robert Koch, a German physician, was able to isolate and create pure cultures of bacteria, and grow them in a laboratory. Bacillus anthracis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis were the bacteria Koch used to prove the germ theory of disease until he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1905. Koch's postulates that he formulated to determine causality between pathogens and infectious diseases are still used today.

A major development in bacteriology occurred in 1977 when Carl Woese published that archaea had a separate evolutionary lineage from bacteria. This phylogenetic taxonomy relies on sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA and divides prokaryotes into two domains, as part of a three-domain system. The ancestors of today's bacteria were unicellular microorganisms that were the first forms of life on Earth about 4 billion years ago. For about 3 billion years, the majority of organisms were microscopic, being dominated by bacteria and archaea. Although bacterial fossils are found, for example in the form of stromatolites, their less distinctive morphology means that they cannot be used to determine the evolutionary history of bacteria or the time of emergence of certain bacterial species. Nonetheless, gene sequences can be used to reconstruct bacterial phylogenies, indicating that it was bacteria that were the first to branch out and branch out from the archaean/eukaryotic lineage. The most recent common ancestor of bacteria and archaea was probably the hyperthermophiles who lived about 2.5 to 3.2 billion years ago. The earliest forms of life on land were probably bacteria which lived around 3.22 billion years ago. Bacteria were also involved in the second major evolutionary divergence that created the ramifications of archaea and eukaryotes. At that time, eukaryotes were formed from the entry of ancient bacteria into the ancestral eukaryotic cells (which may still be closely related to archaea) through endosymbiotic association. More specifically, proto-eukaryotic cells \"engulfed\" Alphaproteobacteria as symbionts to form either mitochondria or hydrogenosomes, which are still found in all known eukaryotic cells (sometimes in highly reduced forms, for example in ancient protozoa without mitochondria). ).",

The oldest cyanobacteria fossils known to date are nearly 3.5 billion years old. Cyanobacteria are larger than most bacteria, and can secrete a thick cell wall. In addition, cyanobacteria can also form large layered structures, which are called stromatolites (if they are dome-shaped) or oncoliths (if they are round). These structures form as beds for cyanobacteria that grow in aquatic environments, forming sediments and sometimes excreting calcium carbonate. When cut very thin, well-preserved fossilized cyanobacteria and algae can be found in fossilized stromatolites. Other than cyanobacteria, there are not many published bacterial fossils. Under certain conditions, the bacterial cell can be confused with minerals, especially with pyrite or siderite (iron carbonate), minerals that can form replicas of living cells or pseudomorphs. Some bacteria also secrete an iron-coated coat that sometimes fossilizes. There are also bacteria that enter the shell or stone and form microscopic channels in the shell; These bacteria are known as endolytics. Bacteria have also been found in amber, fossilized tree resin, and in the tissues of mummies. Bacteria come in all shapes and sizes. Bacterial cells are about one-tenth the size of eukaryotic cells and are typically 0.5 to 5 micrometers in size. However, some species can be seen with the naked eye, for example Thiomargarita namibiensis which reaches half a millimeter in length and Epulopiscium fishelsoni which reaches 0.7 mm.

Some types of bacteria are shaped like slightly curved or comma-shaped rods (called vibrios); other bacteria can be spiral (called a spirillum) or tightly coiled (called a spirocket). Unusual shapes have also been encountered, such as star-shaped bacteria. These various shapes are determined by the bacterial cell wall and cytoskeleton, which play an important role because they affect the ability of bacteria to obtain nutrients, attach to surfaces, swim in fluids, and escape from predators. Many bacterial species are single-celled, while others cluster in distinctive patterns: Neisseria are diploid (in pairs), Streptococcus form chains, while Staphylococcus cluster together like a bunch of grapes. Bacteria can also group together to form larger multicellular structures, such as Actinobacteria with elongated filaments, myxobacteria which form aggregates, and Streptomyces which have complex hyphae. These multicellular structures are often only seen under certain conditions. For example, when deficient in amino acids, myxobacteria detect nearby cells through a process known as quorum sensing to migrate towards one another and assemble to form fruiting bodies up to 500 micrometers in length and containing about 100,000 bacterial cells.

Bacteria living in biofilms display a complex arrangement of cells and extracellular components, as well as form secondary structures, such as microcolonies, within which a network of channels is in place to allow better diffusion of nutrients. In natural environments, such as soil or plant surfaces, most bacteria are bound together in the form of biofilms. Biofilms are important in medicine because these structures often appear during chronic bacterial infections or when medical device implants become infected. Bacteria that are protected in biofilms are much more difficult to kill than bacteria that live alone. Bacterial cells are surrounded by a cell membrane, which is mainly made of phospholipids. This membrane encloses the contents of the cell and serves as a barrier for nutrients, proteins, and other important components in the cytoplasm to keep them inside the cell. Unlike eukaryotes, bacterial cells usually do not have large membrane-enclosed structures within their cytoplasm, such as the nucleus, mitochondria, chloroplasts, and other organelles. However, some bacteria have protein-bound organelles, for example carboxysomes, which create compartments to separate aspects of the bacterial metabolism. In addition, bacteria possess a multicomponent cytoskeleton to regulate the localization of proteins and nucleic acids within the cell, as well as to manage the process of cell division. Many essential biochemical reactions, such as the generation of energy, occur due to concentration gradients across membranes. As a result, a potential difference similar to that of a battery is created. In general, the lack of internal membranes in bacteria results in these reactions, for example the electron transport chain, taking place across the cell membrane, either between the cytoplasm (on the inside of the cell) and the outside of the cell or with the periplasm.",

        "paragraph": "However, in many photosynthetic bacteria, the plasma membrane is highly folded and fills most of the cell with light-collecting membrane layers. This light-collecting complex can form lipid-covered structures called chlorosomes in green sulfur bacteria. Bacteria do not have a membrane-enclosed nucleus. The genetic material is usually a nucleoid, that is, DNA located in the cytoplasm in an irregular manner that forms a single circular chromosome. The nucleoid contains complete chromosomes with their protein and RNA structures. Like all other organisms, bacteria possess ribosomes for making proteins, but the structure of the bacterial ribosome is different from that in eukaryotes and archaea. Some bacteria produce nutrient storage granules within their cells, such as glycogen, polyphosphate, sulfur, or polyhydroxy alkanoates. Some bacteria, such as photosynthetic cyanobacteria, have internal gas vacuoles that they use to regulate buoyancy so they can move up or down in layers of water that have different light intensities and nutrient levels. The layer that surrounds the outside of the cell membrane is the cell wall. The bacterial cell wall is made of peptidoglycan (also called murein), which is composed of polysaccharide chains cross-linked with peptides containing D-amino acids. Bacterial cell walls differ from plant and fungal cell walls, which are made of cellulose and chitin, respectively. Bacterial cell walls are also different from archaea in that they do not contain peptidoglycan. For many bacteria, the cell wall is essential for their survival because some substances, for example penicillin (an antibiotic produced by the fungus Penicillium), are capable of killing bacteria by blocking one step of the reaction in peptidoglycan synthesis. Broadly speaking, there are two types of cell walls in bacteria, which classify bacteria into Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria.",

Gram-positive bacteria have a thick cell wall containing many layers of peptidoglycan and teichoic acid. In contrast, Gram-negative bacteria have a relatively thin cell wall consisting of several layers of peptidoglycan surrounded by a lipid bilayer membrane containing lipopolysaccharides and lipoproteins. Most bacteria have cell walls of the Gram-negative type, and only the phyla Firmicutes and Actinobacteria (formerly known as low G+C and high G+C Gram-positive bacteria, respectively) have alternative Gram-positive arrangements. These structural differences can result in differences in susceptibility to antibiotics; for example, vancomycin can only kill Gram-positive bacteria and is ineffective against Gram-negative pathogens, such as Haemophilus influenzae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Some bacteria have a cell wall structure that is neither Gram-positive nor Gram-negative, including clinically important bacteria such as Mycobacterium which have a cell wall with thick peptidoglycan like Gram-positive bacteria, but also have a second lipid layer on the outside. In many bacteria, the S-layer consists of tightly packed protein molecules covering the outside of the cell. This layer protects the cell surface physically and chemically and can act as a barrier to the diffusion of macromolecules. S-layers have multiple functions, but many of their functions are poorly understood. So far, the S-layer is known to act as a virulence factor in Campylobacter and contains surface enzymes in Bacillus stearothermophilus. Many bacteria have other extracellular structures such as flagella, fimbriae, and pili which are used for locomotion, attachment, and conjugation. Flagella are rigid protein structures used for motility. Flagella are about 20 nanometers in diameter and up to 20 micrometers in length. Flagella are driven by energy released by ion transfer, which occurs due to electrochemical gradients across the cell membrane.",

They are scattered over the cell surface and look like fine hairs when observed through an electron microscope. Fimbriae are believed to be involved in the attachment of bacteria to solid surfaces or to other cells, and play a role in the virulence of some bacterial pathogens. Meanwhile, pili are appendage structures that are slightly larger than fimbriae. These structures are known as conjugating pili or genital pili when they are the means of transferring genetic material between bacterial cells in a process called conjugation (see bacterial genetics below). They can also produce movements called type IV pili. Many bacteria produce glycocalyx to surround their cells. The structural complexity of the glycocalyx varies, from disorganized slime layers made of extracellular polymeric substances to highly structured capsules. These structures can protect bacterial cells from eukaryotic cells, such as macrophages (part of the human immune system), that would engulf them. The glycocalyx also has several other roles: it acts as an antigen, is involved in cell recognition, and aids in surface attachment and biofilm formation. The assembly of extracellular structures depends on the bacterial secretory system, which transfers proteins from the cytoplasm to the periplasm or to the environment around the cell. Scientists are familiar with the various secretory systems of bacteria and have found that the extracellular structures they produce often play an important role in determining the virulence of pathogens. Therefore, they are studied intensively. Several genera of Gram-positive bacteria, such as Bacillus, Clostridium, Sporohalobacter, Anaerobacter, and Heliobacterium, can form highly resistant structures called endospores. Endospores develop in the cytoplasm and generally there is one endospore developing in each cell.",

Endospores show no signs of metabolism and can withstand extreme levels of physical and chemical stress, such as ultraviolet light, gamma radiation, detergents, disinfectants, heat, freezing, pressure, and drying. In this dormant state, an organism can remain alive for millions of years, and endospores even allow bacteria to survive the vacuum and radiation in space so that perhaps bacteria can be distributed throughout the Universe via cosmic dust, meteoroids, asteroids, comets. , planetoids, or via directional panspermia. Endospore-forming bacteria can also cause disease. For example, anthrax can be transmitted by inhaling Bacillus anthracis endospores, while deep puncture wounds contaminated with Clostridium tetani endospores can cause tetanus. In addition, the endospores of Clostridium botulinum protect it from high temperatures and pressures in canned food processing, which can lead to poisoning when consumed. Bacteria show a wide variety of metabolic types. The different metabolic traits within a group of bacteria were originally used to define their taxonomy, but these traits often do not align with modern genetically based classifications. Bacterial metabolism is divided into several groups of nutrients based on three main criteria: energy source, electron donor used, and carbon source used for growth. Bacteria obtain energy in one of two ways: by photosynthesis to convert energy from light (they are called phototrophs) or by breaking down chemical compounds using oxidation (called chemotrophs). Chemotrophic bacteria use chemical compounds as an energy source by transferring electrons from donors to terminal acceptors in redox reactions. This reaction releases energy that can be used to metabolize.",

        "paragraph": "Chemotrophs are further divided based on the type of compound they use to transfer electrons. Bacteria that use inorganic compounds such as hydrogen, carbon monoxide, or ammonia as a source of electrons are called lithotrophs, while those that use organic compounds are called organotrophs. The compounds used to accept electrons are also used to classify bacteria: aerobic organisms use oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor, whereas anaerobic organisms use other compounds such as nitrates, sulfates, or carbon dioxide. Many bacteria obtain carbon for their cells from other organic carbon; they are called heterotrophs. Other bacteria such as cyanobacteria and some purple bacteria are autotrophs, meaning they obtain carbon by fixing carbon dioxide. In certain situations, methane gas can be used by methanotrophic bacteria as a source of electrons and as a substrate for carbon anabolism. In many ways, bacterial metabolism benefits ecological stability and human life. For example, some bacteria are capable of fixing nitrogen gas using the enzyme nitrogenase. This property is environmentally important and can be found in most of the types of bacterial metabolism mentioned above, leading to the processes of denitrification, sulfate reduction, and acetogenesis, all of which are ecologically important. Bacterial metabolic processes also play an important role in pollution; for example, sulfate-reducing bacteria are largely responsible for the production of highly toxic forms of mercury (methylmercury and dimethylmercury) in the environment. Nonrespiratory anaerobic bacteria use fermentation to generate energy and reduce power, and excrete metabolic by-products (such as ethanol in brewing) as waste. Facultative anaerobic bacteria can switch between fermenters and several different terminal electron acceptor forms, depending on the environmental conditions in which they are present. Bacteria live everywhere in abundance. The ecosystems in which bacteria live include terrestrial ecosystems, aquatic ecosystems, inside the bodies of other living things, and in man-made structures.",

Approximately 3.5 x 1030 prokaryotes live in the deep biosphere in the ocean (seafloor layers deeper than 10 cm) and between 0.25\u20132.5 x 1030 in the deep biosphere in terrestrial (subsoil layers deeper than 8 m ). Lower numbers were found in terrestrial habitats, at 2.6 x 1029 cells, and in aquatic habitats, at 1.2 x 1029 cells. Much smaller proportions are found in the bodies of animals (including humans), in leaves and other plant parts, and in the air. Together they form the largest biomass on Earth, surpassed only by plants. In soil, which is an important habitat for a variety of organisms, the number and density of bacteria varies depending on the type of ecosystem. In general, the number of soil bacteria in forest ecosystems is lower than other types of ecosystems, such as desert scrub, savanna, and agricultural land. Up to one meter depth, the number of prokaryotes is estimated at 40 million cells per gram of forest soil, while in other types of terrestrial ecosystems it reaches 2 billion cells per gram of soil. In the aquatic environment, the highest density of bacteria was found in sediments at a thickness of 0 to 10 cm on the seafloor, namely 460 million cells per ml. In these seafloor sediments, bacteria have an important role in biogeochemical cycles, for example in the sulfur cycle played by Desulfobulbaceae. In the vicinity of hydrothermal vents and cold vents, extremophile bacteria provide the nutrients needed to sustain life by converting dissolved compounds, such as hydrogen sulfide and methane, into energy via chemosynthesis. Meanwhile, a lower concentration of prokaryotes was found in the ecosystems of rivers, fresh water lakes and salt lakes, namely 10 million cells per ml, while a density of 5 million cells per ml was found in continental shelf waters and in the open sea to a depth of 200 m.

Even so, their number really depends on many things, such as age, body size, environment, to the food consumed. On the other hand, a study published in 2016 found that the ratio is about 1.3 bacterial cells for every human cell. The number of bacteria in the human digestive tract is quite varied. They are most commonly found in the large intestine, which is about 1011 cells per gram of intestinal contents, while in the small intestine as many as 108 cells per gram, and in the acidic stomach the number is 104 microbial cells per gram. In terms of variation, only two main phyla inhabit the human body, namely Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. Apart from them, the phyla Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia were also recorded. A common example is the lactic acid bacterium Lactobacillus acidophilus. This type is classified as probiotics, which are reported to be beneficial to the body and prevent health problems such as diarrhea and degenerative diseases. Bacteria can also be found on the surface of the skin and in the mouth. Inside the mouth, bacteria can form biofilms in the form of plaque which causes bad breath. Environmental conditions can stimulate or inhibit the growth and reproduction of bacteria. Environmental factors that greatly affect the life of bacteria are temperature, pH, water availability, and oxygen. However, similar to archaea, bacteria are able to live in environments that do not allow other organisms to live, for example environments that are too hot or too cold, too acidic or alkaline, and too salty. Extreme habitats require microorganisms to develop survival skills.",

        "paragraph": "This group of microorganisms is referred to as extremophiles. Temperature is closely related to metabolism. As the temperature increases, enzymatic reactions will take place faster until they reach the optimum temperature which allows bacterial cells to grow at the highest speed. However, after passing a certain temperature, proteins and other cell components will experience denaturation so that the cell will die. Likewise, if the ambient temperature is below the cell's tolerance limit, the cell membrane will lose its semi-liquid state so that it cannot carry out its function. Based on the temperature range of their activity, bacteria are divided into four groups: psychrophiles living in a low temperature environment with an optimum temperature of around 4 \u00b0C, mesophiles living in a moderate temperature environment with an optimum temperature of around 40 \u00b0C, thermophiles living in a high temperature environment with a temperature optimum around 60 \u00b0C, and hyperthermophiles who live in very high temperature environments with an optimum temperature of 88 \u00b0C and even above. For example, Thermus aquaticus is a species of thermophilic bacteria that lives in hot springs. In Antarctica, some bacteria vetrify to survive temperatures down to \u221220 \u00b0C. Besides temperature, the growth and reproduction of bacteria is also determined by the degree of acidity (pH). Most natural environments have a pH between 3 and 9 so almost all bacteria live in this pH range. Each type of microorganism has its own optimum pH range, with a range of 2\u20133 pH units. Therefore, bacteria can also be grouped based on the pH of their environment. Neutrophilic organisms grow in a neutral pH, while acidophiles grow in an acidic environment and alkaliphiles grow in an alkaline environment.

For example, Escherichia coli bacteria will experience a decrease in the resistance and elasticity of their cell walls when the environmental RH is less than 84%. Gram-positive bacteria tend to live at higher air humidity compared to gram-negative bacteria due to changes in the structure of their cell membranes which contain a lipid bilayer. Light is one of the factors that affect the growth of bacteria. In general, bacteria and other microorganisms can live well in normal light exposure. However, exposure to light with high intensity ultraviolet (UV) rays can be fatal for bacterial growth. The technique of using UV rays, x rays, and gamma rays to sterilize an environment from bacteria and other microorganisms is known as irradiation technique which began to develop since the early 20th century. This method has been widely applied for various purposes, especially in food sterilization to increase shelf life and durability. Some examples of pathogenic bacteria that can be inhibited or eliminated include Escherichia coli 0157:H7 and Salmonella. Radiation at certain strengths can cause abnormalities and can even be lethal to living things, especially bacteria. For example in humans, radiation can cause acute liver disease, cataracts, hypertension, and even cancer. However, there is a certain group of bacteria that can survive very high radiation exposure, even hundreds of times greater than human resistance to radiation, namely the Deinococcaceae group. In comparison, humans generally cannot survive radiation exposure of more than 10 Gray (Gy, 1 Gy = 100 rad), while bacteria included in this group can survive up to 5,000 Gy.",

Deinococcus radiodurans has the ability to survive the mechanism of destruction of genetic material through an adaptation system and a very efficient DNA chain repair process. There are also halophilic bacteria that can live in environments with very high salt levels, such as Salinibacter ruber which grow optimally at salt concentrations between 20 and 30%. In addition, a number of other bacteria are able to live at high sugar content (osmophile group), low water content (xerophile group), as well as very high and low degrees of acidity. Some bacterial communities can survive in clouds up to 10 kilometers high. A research team using an old DC-8 aircraft modified as a flying laboratory managed to take samples of a number of bacteria in clouds under storm conditions. Bacteria living in ice nucleation are carried away by storms and survive in cloud ionization. In unicellular organisms, the increase in cell size (cell growth) and reproduction (through cell division) are two things that are closely related. Bacteria grow until they reach a fixed size and then reproduce through binary fission, a form of asexual reproduction. Under optimal conditions, bacteria can grow and divide very quickly; The bacterial population can double every 9.8 minutes. Cell division produces two identical daughter cells. While still reproducing asexually, some bacteria form more complex reproductive structures to help propagate the newly formed daughter cells. For example the formation of fruiting bodies by myxobacteria, the formation of hyphae by Streptomyces, and the formation of shoots. Budding occurs when a cell forms a bulge which then separates from the parent cell to become daughter cells.",

Solid growth media, such as agar plates, are used to isolate pure cultures of a bacterial strain. Meanwhile, liquid growth media are used when scientists want to measure bacterial growth or require large volumes of bacterial cells. The liquid media can be stirred until an even cell suspension is formed so that the bacterial culture is easily divided and transferred to other containers. The use of selective media (medium with the addition or reduction of certain nutrients or with the addition of antibiotics) can help identify specific organisms. Most techniques for growing bacteria in the laboratory use high levels of nutrients to produce large numbers of cells cheaply and quickly. However, in the natural environment, the amount of nutrients is limited. This means that bacteria cannot continue to reproduce forever. Nutritional limitations cause bacteria to evolve different growth strategies (see r/K selection theory). Some organisms can grow very quickly when enough nutrients are available, such as the algae (and cyanobacteria) population explosions that often occur in lakes during the summer. Other bacteria are adapted to harsh environments, such as Streptomyces which produce some antibiotics to inhibit the growth of competing microorganisms. In nature, many organisms live in communities (e.g. biofilms), which allows for increased supply of nutrients and protection from environmental stresses. These relationships become important for the growth of a particular organism or group of organisms (referred to as syntrophy). Bacterial growth consists of four phases. When bacterial populations first enter a high-nutrient environment that allows growth, they need to adapt to their new environment. The first phase is the sluggish phase. Growth occurs slowly as bacterial cells adapt to the nutrient-rich environment and prepare for rapid growth.",

The second growth phase is the logarithmic phase, which is also known as the exponential phase. The log phase is characterized by rapid exponential growth. The rate of increase in the number of cells during this phase is known as the growth rate (k), while the time it takes for cells to multiply is known as the formation time (g). During the log phase, nutrients are metabolized at maximum speed until one nutrient is depleted and growth is restricted. The third phase is the stationary phase or the stationary phase due to depleted nutrients. The cells reduce their metabolic activity and consume non-essential internal cell proteins. The quiescent phase is a transition from a state of rapid growth to a state that responds to stress. There is increased expression of genes involved in DNA repair, antioxidant metabolism, and nutrient transport. The final phase is the death phase when the bacteria run out of nutrients and die. Most bacteria have a single coiled chromosome that can range in length from 160,000 base pairs (bp) in the endosymbiotic bacterium Carsonella ruddii, to 12,200,000 base pairs (12.2 Mbp) in the soil-dwelling bacterium Sorangium cellulosum. There are many variations in the shape of bacterial chromosomes, for example some Streptomyces and Borrelia species have one linear chromosome, while some Vibrio species have more than one chromosome. Bacteria can also contain plasmids, small extrachromosomal DNA molecules that may contain genes useful for developing various functions, such as antibiotic resistance, metabolic ability, or virulence factors. The bacterial genome usually encodes several hundred to several thousand genes. The genes are generally arranged linked together on a single stretch of DNA and although several types of introns are found in bacterial genomes, their frequency is much less than introns in eukaryotes.",

Even so, all bacteria can evolve and undergo DNA changes due to genetic recombination or mutation. Mutations are caused by errors that occur during DNA replication or by exposure to mutagens. Mutation rates vary widely among different bacterial species and even among clones derived from a single bacterial species. Mutations can occur randomly during replication or as a result of \u201cstress driving\u201d, when the mutation rate increases in certain genes involved in growth-limiting situations. Some bacteria can transfer genetic material between cells in three main ways. First, bacteria can take up exogenous DNA from the surrounding environment through a process called transformation. Naturally, many bacteria are competent to take up DNA from the environment, while other bacteria must be chemically modified to induce them to take up DNA. This ability can be developed naturally and is usually associated with stressful environmental conditions, as an adaptation of bacteria to repair damaged DNA. The second way of transferring genetic material is by transduction, when a bacteriophage (a type of virus) inserts foreign DNA into the bacterial chromosome. There are many types of bacteriophages; some of them simply infect and lyse their host bacteria, while others enter into the bacterial chromosome. Bacteria fight phage infection through a restriction modification system that degrades foreign DNA and a system that uses CRISPR which allows them to block viral replication via RNA interference. A third method of transferring genes is conjugation, in which DNA is transferred by direct cell-to-cell contact. Under normal circumstances, transfer of DNA by transduction, conjugation, and transformation involves individual bacteria of the same species, but sometimes transfer of DNA can occur between individuals of different species and this can have significant effects, such as the transfer of antibiotic resistance capabilities.",

The most well-studied locomotor is the flagellum, a long, whip-like filament whose base attaches to a rotating rotor to produce a propeller-like motion. The direction of rotation of the flagella is reversible, which uses an electrochemical gradient across the membrane to create power. Different bacterial species have different numbers and arrangements of flagella. There are species that have a single flagellum (called monotric bacteria), there are also those that have flagella at each end (amphitric), have groups of flagella at the poles of the cell (lophotric), or flagella that are distributed throughout the cell surface (peritric). The flagella of the spirocket are found in a unique location, namely between two membranes in the periplasmic space. This group of bacteria has a characteristic helical body that rotates with them when they move. Motile bacteria approach or move away from certain stimuli. This behavior is called taxis, which includes chemotaxis, phototaxis, energitaxis, and magnetotaxy. In one special group, the mycobacteria, individual bacteria move together to form a wave of cells which then differentiate to form fruiting bodies that contain spores. Myxobacteria only move on solid surfaces, unlike E. coli, which moves in liquid or solid media. As intracellular pathogens, some Listeria and Shigella species move within host cells by taking over the cytoskeleton, which is normally used to move organelles within the host cell. By inducing actin polymerization at one of the poles of their cell, they can form a kind of tail to move around in the cytoplasm of the host cell. This form of communication between bacteria is found in biofilms. Bacterial cells that form aggregates exchange molecular signals to communicate and engage in coordinated multicellular behavior. Benefits of multicellular cooperation include regulating the division of cellular labor, accessing resources that cannot be used effectively by a single cell, collectively defending against antagonists, and optimizing population survival by differentiating into different types of cells.",

One type of intercellular communication that uses molecular signals is quorum sensing. This mechanism serves to determine the local density of similar bacteria. If the density is high enough, the bacteria will together do the same thing, for example secrete digestive enzymes or emit light. In quorum sensing, bacteria will generate, release, and detect molecular signals. If the molecular signals are numerous (as a result of the large number of conspecific bacteria), they then carry out coordinated gene expression, which produces proteins and initiates similar behavior. Taxonomy aims to describe the diversity of bacterial species by naming and grouping bacteria based on their similarities. Bacteria can be classified based on cell structure, cell metabolism, or differences in cell components, such as DNA, fatty acids, pigments, antigens, and quinones. Although this method allows identification and classification of bacterial strains, the differences found are still unclear, whether they represent variations among different species or between strains of the same species. This uncertainty is due to the lack of differentiating structures in most bacteria as well as the presence of horizontal gene transfer among unrelated species. As a result of horizontal gene transfer, a number of closely related bacteria can have very different morphologies and metabolisms. To address this uncertainty, modern bacterial classification employs molecular phylogenetics, which employs genetic techniques such as determination of the cytosine-guanine ratio, genome-genome hybridization, and sequencing of genes that have not undergone extensive horizontal gene transfer, such as rRNA genes.

Initially, the term \"bacteria\" was used to refer to all single-celled microscopic prokaryotes. However, molecular phylogenetics suggests that prokaryotes consist of two separate domains, originally called Eubacteria and Archaebacteria, but now called Bacteria and Archaea; both evolved independently from a common ancestor. The kinship between archaea and eukaryotes is much closer than that between them and bacteria. All of them, namely Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya, form a three-domain system which is currently the most widely used classification system. However, because the application of molecular phylogenetics is still relatively new and the number of known genome sequences is increasing rapidly, bacterial classification remains a changing and evolving field. For example, Cavalier-Smith, an evolutionary biologist, argues that archaea and eukaryotes evolved from Gram-positive bacteria. Identification of bacteria in the laboratory is very relevant in medical science because the right therapy is determined by the accuracy of identifying the bacteria that cause infection. Consequently, the need to identify pathogens was a major impetus for developing bacterial identification techniques. The Gram stain, developed in 1884 by Hans Christian Gram, classifies bacteria based on the structure of their cell wall. The thick layer of peptidoglycan in the cell wall of \"Gram-positive\" bacteria shows a purple color, while the thin cell wall of \"Gram-negative\" bacteria appears pink. By combining morphology and Gram stain, most bacteria can be classified as one of four groups: Gram-positive cocci, Gram-positive bacilli, Gram-negative cocci and Gram-negative bacilli. A number of bacteria are better identified by stains than Gram stain, especially Mycobacterium or Nocardia, which show acid fastness on Ziehl\u2013Neelsen stain or similar stains.",

Bacterial culture is designed to promote growth and identify specific bacteria, while limiting the growth of other bacteria in the sample. Certain types of specimens are usually treated by certain techniques; for example, sputum specimens are handled to identify pneumonia-causing organisms, while stool specimens are cultured on selective media that can identify diarrhea-causing organisms, while preventing the growth of nonpathogenic bacteria. Specimens that are normally sterile, such as blood, urine, or cerebrospinal fluid, are cultured under conditions designed to grow all possible microorganisms. Once pathogenic bacteria have been isolated, they can be further characterized based on their morphology, growth pattern (such as aerobic or anaerobic growth), pattern of hemolysis, and their response to staining. Like classification, bacterial identification techniques are also increasing with the advent of molecular methods. Diagnosis using DNA-based methods, such as the polymerase chain reaction, is gaining popularity because of its speed and specificity compared to culture-based methods. Molecular methods also allow the detection and identification of \"viable but non-culturable\" cells, that is, bacteria that are metabolically active but not dividing. However, even using modern methods, the number of bacterial species is not known and cannot even be estimated with certainty. Based on the current classification, the number of known species of prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea) is close to 9,300. On the other hand, studies that estimate the overall amount of bacterial diversity range from 107 to 109 species\u2014and even these large interval estimates may be far off the mark. Despite their apparent simplicity, bacteria can form complex associations with other organisms. This symbiotic association can be divided into parasitism, mutualism, and commensalism.

Other bacterial predators are able to latch on to their prey to digest and absorb nutrients, such as Vampirovibrio chlorellavorus, or invade other cells and multiply within their cytosol, such as Daptobacter. Predatory bacteria are thought to have evolved from saprophages, which feed on dead microorganisms, through adaptations that allowed them to trap and kill other organisms. Several types of bacteria form close relationships with other organisms to maintain their survival. One such symbiotic mutualism is called interspecies hydrogen transfer, which occurs between groups of anaerobic bacteria that consume organic acids (such as butyric acid or propionic acid) and produce hydrogen and methanogenic archaea that consume hydrogen. These bacteria cannot consume large amounts of organic acids because the reaction produces hydrogen which accumulates around them. Only by being in close contact with hydrogen-consuming archaea can the hydrogen concentration be kept low enough for the bacteria to continue growing. In the soil, microorganisms in the rhizosphere (the zone covering the surface of the roots and the soil that adheres to the roots after gentle shaking) carry out nitrogen fixation, which converts nitrogen gas into nitrogen-containing compounds. This reaction serves to provide an easily absorbed form of nitrogen for many plants that cannot fix nitrogen on their own. Meanwhile, many other bacteria are found as symbionts in humans and other organisms. For example, there are more than 1,000 species of bacteria as normal flora in the human intestine that play a role in forming intestinal immunity, synthesizing vitamins such as vitamin B7, vitamin B9, and vitamin K, converting sugar into lactic acid (called lactic acid bacteria such as Lactobacillus), and fermenting complex carbohydrates that humans cannot digest.",

If bacteria form a parasitic symbiosis with other organisms, they are classified as pathogens. Pathogenic bacteria are one of the causes of infectious diseases such as tetanus (caused by Clostridium tetani), typhoid fever (Salmonella serovar Typhi), diphtheria (Corynebacterium diphtheriae), syphilis (Treponema pallidum), cholera (Vibrio cholerae), leprosy (Mycobacterium leprae), and tuberculosis (Mycobacterium tuberculosis), to various foodborne diseases. It is possible for a disease to be known as the causative pathogen many years later, such as the case of peptic ulcer disease and Helicobacter pylori. Bacterial diseases are also important in agriculture and animal husbandry, for example bacteria that cause leaf spot, fire blight and wilting in plants, as well as paratuberculosis, mastitis and anthrax in livestock. Each pathogen species has a unique spectrum of interactions with its host. Bacteria in the genera Staphylococcus and Streptococcus can cause skin infections, pneumonia, meningitis and sepsis, which are systemic inflammatory responses that can lead to shock, massive vasodilation and death. However, they are also part of the normal human flora and are usually present on the skin or in the nose without causing any disease. Other bacteria always cause disease in humans, such as Rickettsia which is an obligate intracellular parasite that is able to grow and reproduce only within the cells of other organisms. One species of Rickettsia causes typhus, while another species causes Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Chlamydia, another obligate intracellular pathogen, contains species that can cause pneumonia and urinary tract infections and may be involved in coronary heart disease. Several other species, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cenocepacia, and Mycobacterium avium, are opportunistic pathogens that cause disease especially in people suffering from immunosuppression or cystic fibrosis.",

        "paragraph": "Bacterial infections can be treated with antibiotics, which are classed as bactericidal if they kill bacteria or bacteriostatic if they only prevent the growth of bacteria. There are many types of antibiotics that are grouped into several groups. Each class of antibiotics has a different action in preventing certain chemical processes in the bacterial cells found in the host. Examples of antibiotics that produce selective toxicity are chloramphenicol and puromycin. Both of these classes of antibiotics inhibit bacterial ribosomes, but not the structurally different eukaryotic ribosomes. Antibiotics are used to treat human diseases and to accelerate the growth of animals in intensive farming, which may have contributed to the rapid development of antibiotic resistance in bacterial populations. Bacterial infections can be prevented by antiseptic measures, for example by sterilizing the skin before piercing it with a syringe and maintaining the sterility of the catheter that will be inserted into the body. Surgical and dental equipment is also sterilized to prevent bacterial contamination. Disinfectants such as bleach are used to kill bacteria or other pathogens on surfaces to prevent contamination and reduce the risk of infection. The diversity of bacteria and their metabolic pathways causes bacteria to have a major role in the environment. For example, saprophytic bacteria decompose dead plants or animals and the remains or excrement of organisms. The bacteria decompose proteins, carbohydrates and other organic compounds into CO2, ammonia gas and other simpler compounds. Examples of saprophytic bacteria include Proteus and Clostridium. Not only act as decomposers of organic compounds, several groups of saprophytic bacteria are also opportunistic pathogens. Other groups of bacteria play a role in the nitrogen cycle, such as nitrifying bacteria.

Nitrification consists of two stages, namely nitritation (oxidation of ammonia (NH4) to nitrite (NO2-)) and nitration (oxidation of nitrite compounds to nitrate (NO3)). In agriculture, nitrification is very beneficial because it produces compounds needed by plants, namely nitrates. After the nitrification reaction is complete, a nitrification process will occur which is carried out by denitrifying bacteria. Denitrification itself is the anaerobic reduction of nitrate compounds into free nitrogen (N2) which is more easily absorbed and metabolized by various living things. Examples of bacteria capable of this metabolism are Pseudomonas stutzeri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Paracoccus denitrificans. In addition, this reaction also produces nitrogen in other forms, such as nitrous oxide (N2O). These compounds can not only play an important role for the life of various organisms, but can also play a role in the phenomenon of acid rain and ozone depletion. N2O compounds will be oxidized to NO compounds and then react with ozone (O3) to form NO2- which will return to earth in the form of acid rain (HNO2). In agriculture, it is known that there is a group of bacteria that are able to symbiosis with plant roots or live freely in the soil to help enrich the soil. This group of bacteria is known as nitrogen fixing bacteria or nitrogen bacteria for short. Nitrogen bacteria are a group of bacteria that are able to bind nitrogen (especially N2) free in the air and reduce it to ammonia compounds (NH4) and nitrate ions (NO3-) with the help of the enzyme nitrogenase. This group of bacteria usually symbiosis with legumes and legumes to form a mutualism symbiosis in the form of nodules or root nodules to fix free nitrogen in the air which in general cannot be used directly by most organisms.

Affected plants show symptoms of sudden wilting and can even cause death. One of the diseases that attack orchids is soft rot caused by the bacterium Erwinia carotovora. In the development of the pathogen, the symptoms will quickly spread and can kill the growing point of the plant. Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Swings et al. 1990) is a plant pathogenic bacterium that causes leaf blight in rice, which is also known as crackle disease.

Several types of bacteria, especially heterotrophic bacteria, are able to degrade organic compounds and use them to support their growth. This decomposition process is assisted by several types of enzymes to break down macromolecules, such as carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, to be broken down into simpler compounds. For example, protease enzymes are used to break down proteins into simpler compounds, such as amino acids.

To overcome this feeling of disappointment, the husband and wife must negotiate, if the negotiation is successful then the husband and wife relationship will improve, conversely if the husband and wife do not negotiate then it does not rule out the possibility of the marriage experiencing destruction or divorce. Karim, (1999 in Ihromi, 2004: 137) states, divorce is a living divorce between husband and wife as a result of their failure to carry out their respective role obligations, in this case divorce is seen as the end of an unstable marriage where the husband and wife then live separated and officially recognized by applicable law.

Divorce is the breaking up of a family because one or both partners decide to leave each other so that they stop carrying out their obligations as husband and wife. In addition, divorce is a family situation that is not harmonious, unstable or messy, usually the occurrence of divorce is due to the presence of instigators from blood descendants so that they intervene excessively with the aim of the divorce occurring.

Divorce results in loneliness in life, because of the loss of a life partner, because everyone certainly has aspirations to get a life partner that is eternal. If the expected partner is lost, it will cause turmoil, as if life is no longer useful, because there is no place to devote and complain about problems to be solved together.

Emotion regulation is a way that someone can use to control negative emotions in themselves. Gross (1999) defines emotion regulation as the way individuals influence the emotions they have, when they feel them and how they experience or express these emotions. Emotion comes from the Latin movere which means to move, so emotion means something that encourages a change in a situation. Emotion according to Goleman (2004: 239) is an upheaval of thoughts and feelings, including every great mental state, overflowing and leading to the emergence of a distinctive feeling, certain physiological changes and a tendency to move. Gross, (1999) said that the role of emotions seems to be very prominent in everyday life. So it is very difficult to imagine someone without emotions. Without an emotion, a person will not feel sad when they fail, feel happy to see themselves succeed and succeed, or feel embarrassed when they make a mistake in a public place. Therefore, emotions can arise from an unusual event, light or heavy, personal or public events, simple to complex events.

So emotions arise because there is a situation that is considered important and influential in the individual. English and English (Yusuf 2008:114) state that emotion is \"A complex feeling state accompanied by characteristic motor and glandular activities\". A complex sensory state characterized by glandular and motor activity. Children who experience emotions will feel motor changes and gland activity that moves faster. Goleman (2004 Desmita 2013: 116), uses the term emotion to refer to a feeling and its distinctive thoughts, psychological and biological states, and range of propensities to act. According to Crow and Crow (1990 in Syaodih 2005:46) reveals that emotion is a state of turmoil in the individual that functions as an inner adjustment (adjustment from within) to the environment to achieve prosperity in individual safety.

This emotional regulation is carried out to achieve social desires and appropriate physical and psychological responses to Hwang's intrinsic and extrinsic demands (2006 in Fitri, 2012: 2). Thompson (1991: 288) describes emotion regulation as the ability to respond to extrinsic and intrinsic processes to monitor, evaluate, and modify intense and persistent emotional reactions to achieve a goal. Emotion regulation according to Gross (1999 in Alfian 2014: 266) is the way individuals process the emotions they have, when they feel them and how they experience or express these emotions. Emotion regulation can also be interpreted as the ability to evaluate and change emotional reactions to certain behaviors that are appropriate to the current situation (Thompson, 2001). Regulation itself is a form of control that a person exercises over his emotions. Regulations can affect a person's behavior and experiences. The result of regulation can be behavior that is enhanced, reduced, or inhibited in its expression. Emotion regulation comes from social sources. This social resource is part of the interest in other people and the norms of Frijda's social interactions (1986 in Alfian, 2014: 265).

The ability to regulate emotions can be seen if it fulfills five of the seven skills proposed by Goleman (2004:240), namely: Each individual has a different way of regulating emotions.

In the stereoisomer form, monosaccharides have at least one asymmetric carbon atom. Monosaccharides are formed from the synthesis of simple compounds through the process of gluconeogenesis. The formation of monosaccharides can also be carried out through photosynthesis in certain plants and bacteria. In complex lipids, monosaccharides are the building blocks of nucleic acids and important compounds. Some monosaccharides have a sweet taste. The general properties of monosaccharides are water soluble, colorless, and crystalline solids. Examples of monosaccharides are glucose (dextrose), fructose (levulose), galactose, xylose and ribose. Honey is a natural food ingredient that contains mostly monosaccharides, especially fructose and glucose. Monosaccharides are compounds that form disaccharides (such as sucrose) and polysaccharides (such as cellulose and starch). Monosaccharides are classified based on the number of carbon atoms they contain (triose, tetrose, pentose, hexose, and heptose) and their active group, which can be an aldehyde or a ketone. These then combine, becoming for example aldohexoses and ketotrioses. Furthermore, each carbon atom to which the hydroxyl group is attached (except at both ends) is optically active, resulting in several different carbohydrates even though the basic structure is the same. For example, galactose is an aldohexose, but it has different properties from glucose because the atoms are arranged differently. With a few exceptions (eg deoxyribose), monosaccharides have the general chemical formula Cx(H2O)y, where x is at least 3. Monosaccharides can be grouped according to the number of carbon atoms (or the number of x) they contain: diose (2) triose (3) tetrose ( 4), pentoses (5), hexoses (6), heptoses (7), and so on. The most important type of monosaccharide, glucose, is a hexose.",

        "paragraph": "An example of a heptose is the ketose manoheptulose and sedoheptulose. Monosaccharides with 8 or fewer carbon atoms are rare because they are somewhat unbalanced. Another example: Simple monosaccharides have straight, unbranched carbon chains with one carbonyl functional group (C=O), and one hydroxyl group (OH) on each remaining carbon atom. Thus, the molecular structure of a simple monosaccharide can be written as H(CHOH)n(C=O)(CHOH)mH, where n+1+m = x; then, the elemental formula is CxH2xOx. Most monosaccharides are colorless, and crystalline solids (sweet). With a few exceptions (eg deoxyribose or amino sugars), monosaccharides have a general chemical formula: Monosaccharides contain either a ketone or an aldehyde functional group. A common way of representing the cyclic structure of a monosaccharide is by using the Haworth projection. Usually the D,L system is used. Monosaccharides containing an aldehyde group are classified as aldoses, while those containing a ketone group are called ketoses. Monosaccharides can be formed through the hydrolysis of cellulose by cellulase enzymes, namely endoglucanase, exoglucanase, and cellobiase. Endoglucanase plays a role in random hydrolysis of the amorphous cellulose. Hydrolysis results in the form of molecules with a lighter mass, namely cellodextrin, cellobiose, and glucose. Exoglucanase destroys the crystalline structure of cellulose and produces disaccharides. Meanwhile, cellobiase converts disaccharides into two glucose molecules, a type of simple sugar, which is the basic ingredient in the manufacture of ethanol. Palm sugar is formed from microbial invertase on sucrose inversion in sap. The sugar content contained in the sap becomes a reducing agent for sucrose. This reducing agent is a monosaccharide consisting of a mixture of fructose and glucose. The sucrose inversion process occurs shortly after tapping the sap until the sap is cooked into sugar. Fructose and glucose are formed by hydrolysis by acids during the boiling of sucrose solutions.",

According to the Gregorian Calendar, Dipawali occurs in October or November. In 2005, Dipawali Celebration was celebrated on November 1st. In 2006, Dipawali Celebration was celebrated on 21 October. In 2007, Dipawali Celebration was celebrated on November 8, and in 2022, Dipawali Celebration was celebrated on November 12, more precisely on Sunday. Dipawali is a celebration that marks the victory of good (Dharma) over evil (Adharma). The word Dipawali is taken from Sanskrit, namely, the word Dipavali which means a line of light which signifies the victory of light over darkness. During the Dipawali Celebration, many Hindus wear new clothes, share sweets with those closest to them and set off fireworks. In northern India, Hindus begin a new financial period on Dipawali. During the Dipawali Celebration, Hindus celebrate the return of Rama (The King of Ayodhya), and his wife (Sita), and his younger brother who is an admiral from the City of Ayodhya. At one point, There was a Battle in the City of Ayodhya where Rama killed Asura Ravana (Ravana). Hindus believe that the lighting of the lamp symbolizes the Path of light that guides them in darkness. The first day of the Dipawali Celebration is called Vasu Daras. Vasu Daras is dedicated to Cows (Animals that are considered sacred according to Hindus). At the time of Vasu Daras, King Pithu liberated his people from Famine by capturing \"Earth\". In Hindu mythology, the cow is the embodiment of the Earth whose milk brings life and soil fertility. The second day of the Dipawali Celebration is called Dhan Teras.",

The third day of the Dipawali Celebration is called Naraka Chaturdashi. Naraka Chaturdashi is the anniversary of when Lord Krishna killed a giant named Narakasura. This event is a day that is complemented by the making of Rangoli (a form of traditional Indian art in the form of decorations from rice and flour colored with spices). In addition, at the time of the Naraka Chaturdashi Celebration, adherents of Hinduism perform a form of worship of the god Krisna. The fourth day of the Dipawali Celebration is called Laksmi Puja. Laksmi Puja is complemented by a form of worship of Goddess Laksmi (Goddess who brings prosperity) and Dewa Ganesh (God who brings good luck). In the northern part of India, the fourth day is the highlight of the Dipawali Celebration. The fifth day of the Dipawali Celebration is called Bali Pratipada. Bali Pratipada is a day of remembrance when Lord Krisna saved the people and cows from a natural disaster, namely flooding by lifting Govadhana Hill. The sixth day of the Dipawali Celebration is called Yama Dwitiya. Yama Dwitiya is a day of remembrance to commemorate the visit of Dewa Yama (God of death) to the place of his sister, Dewi Yami. The visit was complemented by a shared meal. At the time of eating together, Lord Yama gave gifts to his sister.

        "paragraph": "Page editor logged out learn more Tuberculosis (abbreviated Tbc), or Tb (abbreviation for \"Tubercle bacillus\") is a common, and in many cases fatal, infectious disease. The disease is caused by various strains of mycobacteria, most commonly Mycobacterium tuberculosis (abbreviated \"MTb\" or \"MTbc\"). Tuberculosis usually affects the lungs, but can affect other parts of the body. Tuberculosis is spread through the air when a person with an active TB infection coughs, sneezes, or disperses their saliva through the air. The majority of TB infections are asymptomatic and latent (often called latent TB). However, one in ten cases of latent infection develops into active disease (active TB). If tuberculosis is not treated, more than 50% of infected people will die. Before the discovery of effective antibiotics to treat TB (around the early 1900s) an estimated 1 in 7 people in the world died from this disease. The classic symptoms of active TB infection are a chronic cough with blood streaks in the sputum or sputum, fever, night sweats and weight loss. (TB used to be called a \"consumption\" disease because people who were infected usually lost weight). Infections in other organs cause various symptoms. The diagnosis of active TB depends on radiological results (usually through a chest X-ray) as well as physical examination and microbiological culture. Meanwhile, the diagnosis of latent TB relies on the tuberculin skin test (TST) and blood test (IGRA). Treatment of active TB requires regular administration of multiple antibiotics over a period of 6 to 12 months. People who come into contact should also be screened and treated if necessary. With the development of currently available antibiotics, TB treatment that is carried out properly will provide a cure rate above 90%.",

Antibiotic resistance is a major problem in the management of the TB epidemic. Multi-drug resistant tuberculosis infection (or often called MDR TB) requires much more severe treatment with much higher doses of drugs and a much lower cure rate. To prevent TB, everyone should have a screening test for the disease and get the Calmette\u2013Gu\u00e9rin bacillus vaccination. Experts believe that one third of the world's population has been infected with M. tuberculosis, and new infections are occurring at a rate of one person per second. In 2007, there were an estimated 13.7 million active chronic cases globally. In 2010, it is estimated that there will be an additional 8.8 million new cases and 1.5 million deaths, the majority of which occur in developing countries. The absolute number of tuberculosis cases has been decreasing since 2006, while new cases have been decreasing since 2002. Tuberculosis is not evenly distributed throughout the world. Of the population in various countries in Asia and Africa who have a tuberculin test, 80% show a positive result, while in the United States, only 5\u201310% show a positive result. More and more people in developing countries are suffering from tuberculosis because their immune system is weak. Usually, they suffer from tuberculosis as a result of being infected with the HIV virus and develop into AIDS. In the 1990s, Indonesia was ranked 3rd in the world for TB sufferers, but the situation has improved and in 2013 it was ranked 5th in the world.

Tuberculosis can infect any part of the body, but most often it infects the lungs (known as pulmonary tuberculosis). When tuberculosis develops outside the lungs, it is called extrapulmonary TB. Extrapulmonary TB can also occur together with pulmonary TB. Common signs and symptoms include fever, chills, night sweats, loss of appetite, weight loss and lethargy. There may also be significant clubbing. When the tuberculosis infection that occurs becomes active, about 90% always involves the lungs. Symptoms include chest pain and a prolonged cough with phlegm. About 25% of sufferers do not show any symptoms (which are thus called \"asymptomatic\"). Sometimes, sufferers experience a bit of coughing up blood. In certain rare cases, the infection can erode into the pulmonary artery, causing severe bleeding called a Rasmussen's aneurysm. Tuberculosis can also develop into a chronic disease and cause extensive scarring of the upper lobes of the lungs. The upper lung is most commonly infected. The reasons are not yet clear. It might be because the upper lungs get more airflow or it could be due to poor lymph drainage in the upper lungs. In 15\u201320% of active cases, the infection spreads beyond the respiratory organs and causes other forms of tuberculosis. Tuberculosis that occurs outside the respiratory organs is called \"extrapulmonary tuberculosis\". Extrapulmonary TB commonly occurs in immunosuppressed adults and children. Extrapulmonary TB occurs in more than 50% of the HIV-infected group. Significant extrapulmonary TB sites include: the pleura (in TB pleurisy), the central nervous system (in TB meningitis), and the lymph system (in scrofuloderma of the neck).",

When TB spreads to the bones it can be called \"bone TB\", which is a form of osteomyelitis. There is more serious TB, namely TB that is widespread and is referred to as disseminated TB, or usually known as Milier Tuberculosis. Among cases of extrapulmonary TB, 10% are usually Miliary TB. The main cause of TB disease is Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which is a small non-motile aerobic bacillus. The various unique clinical characters of this pathogen are due to its high fat/lipid content. The cells divide every 16 \u201320 hours. This cleavage speed is slow when compared to other types of bacteria which generally divide every less than an hour. Mycobacteria have an outer lipid bilayer. When a Gram stain test is performed, MTB will show a weak \"Gram-positive\" stain or show no color at all due to the high content of fat and mycolic acid in its cell wall. MTB can withstand weak disinfectants and can survive dry conditions for weeks. In nature, the bacteria can only grow within the host cells of certain organisms, but M. tuberculosis can be cultured in the laboratory. By using histological stains on expectorated sputum samples, researchers can identify MTB under ordinary (light) microscopy. (Phlegm is also called \"sputum\"). MTB retains its color even though it has been treated with an acid solution, so it can be classified as an Acid Resistant Bacillus (BTA). The two most common types of acid staining techniques are: the Ziehl-Neelsen staining technique, which will give the AFB bacteria a bright red color when placed on a blue background, and the auramin-rhodamine staining technique then viewed under a fluorescent microscope.",

M. africanum is not widespread, but is an important cause of tuberculosis in parts of Africa. M. bovis is a common cause of tuberculosis, but the introduction of pasteurized milk has succeeded in eradicating this type of mycobacteria which has been a public health problem in developing countries. M. canetti is a rare species and seems to only occur in the Horn of Africa, although cases have been found in groups of African emigrants. M. microti is also a rare strain and is often found in immunodeficient individuals, however, this pathogen may be more common than we think. Other known pathogenic mycobacteria include M. leprae, M. avium, and M. kansasii. The last two types fall into the classification of \"non-tuberculous mycobacteria\" (MNT). MNT does not cause TB or leprosy, but it does cause other TB-like lung diseases. There are several factors that cause why people are more susceptible to TB infection. At the global level, the most important risk factor is HIV; 13% of all TB cases were also infected with the HIV virus. This problem is common in sub-Saharan Africa, where HIV rates are high. Tuberculosis is closely related to overcrowding and malnutrition. This linkage makes TB one of the main diseases of poverty. People who are at high risk of becoming infected with TB include: people who inject illegal drugs, residents and employees of places where vulnerable people congregate (for example, prisons and homeless shelters), poor people who do not have access to adequate health care adequate, high-risk ethnic minorities, and health workers serving these people.",

Certain drugs, such as corticosteroids and infliximab (anti-\u03b1TNF monoclonal antibody) are also risk factors of increasing importance, especially in the developing world. Although genetic susceptibility can also play a role, researchers have not yet explained to what extent this plays a role. When someone with active pulmonary TB coughs, sneezes, talks, sings, or spits, they are spraying droplets of infectious aerosol with a diameter of 0.5 to 5 \u00b5m. Sneezes can release up to 40,000 tiny particles. Every droplet can transmit tuberculosis because the infectious dose of this disease is very low. (A person who inhales less than 10 bacteria alone can become infected immediately). People who are in contact for a long time, frequently, or are always in close proximity to TB sufferers, are at high risk of becoming infected, with an estimated infection rate of around 22%. A person with active TB and not receiving treatment may infect 10-15 (or more) other people each year. Usually, only those with active TB can transmit the disease. People with latent infection are not believed to transmit the disease. The likelihood of this disease being transmitted from one person to another depends on several factors. These factors include the number of infectious drops sprayed by the carrier, the effectiveness of ventilation of the living environment, the duration of exposure, the level of virulence of the M. tuberculosis strain, and the level of immunity of the uninfected person.

About 90% of people infected with M. tuberculosis have asymptomatic latent TB infection, (sometimes called LTBI/Latent TB Infections). Throughout life, these people have only a 10% chance of their latent infection developing into overt active TB disease. The risk of TB in people living with HIV developing into active disease increases by about 10% each year. If not given effective treatment, the active TB mortality rate can reach more than 66%. TB infection begins when mycobacteria enter the alveoli of the lungs, then invade and replicate in the endosomes of alveolar macrophages. The primary site of infection in the lungs, known as a \"Ghon focus\", is in the upper part of the lower lobe, or in the lower part of the upper lobe. Pulmonary tuberculosis can also occur through a bloodstream infection known as Simon's focus. Simon's focus of infection is usually found at the top of the lung. Hematogenous (through blood vessels) transmission can also spread to other locations such as peripheral lymph nodes, kidneys, brain and bones. Tuberculosis affects all parts of the body, although it is not known why it rarely affects the heart, skeletal muscle, pancreas or thyroid. Tuberculosis is classified as a disease that causes granulomatous inflammation. Cells such as macrophages, T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and fibroblasts combine to form granulomas.

The bacteria then spread throughout the body and form multiple foci of infection, which appear as small white tubercles in the tissue. This very severe TB disease is called miliary tuberculosis. This type of TB is most common in children and people with HIV. The fatality rate for people with disseminated TB like this is quite high despite receiving treatment (about 30%). In many people, these infections often come and go. Tissue destruction and necrosis are often balanced by rapid healing and fibrosis. The infected tissue turns into a scar and the cavities are filled with the caseous necrotic material. During the active period of the disease, some of these cavities also enter the bronchial airways and the necrotic material may be coughed up. This material contains live bacteria and can spread infection. Treatment using appropriate antibiotics can kill these bacteria and make way for the healing process. When the disease has healed, the infected area turns into scar tissue. It is very difficult to diagnose active tuberculosis based on signs and symptoms alone. It is also difficult to diagnose the disease in people who are immunosuppressed.

However, the culture process for this slow-growing organism takes two to six weeks for blood and sputum cultures alone. Therefore, treatment is often started before culture results are complete. Nucleic acid amplification tests and adenosine deaminase tests can more quickly diagnose TB. However, this test is not routinely recommended because it rarely changes the way sufferers are treated. Blood tests to detect antibodies are not very specific or sensitive, so this test is also not recommended. The Mantoux tuberculin skin test is often used as a screening tool for someone at high risk of TB. People who have been previously immunized may give a false positive test result. Test results can give false negatives in people with sarcoidosis, Hodgkin's Lymphoma, and malnutrition. Most importantly, test results can be false-negative in people who have active tuberculosis. Interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs) for blood samples are recommended in people with a positive Mantoux test result.

Tuberculosis is not common in most of Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States, so BCG is only given to people at high risk.

Patients with latent infection are also treated to prevent the emergence of active TB in later life. WHO recommends directly observed therapy or direct supervision therapy, in which a health supervisor supervises the patient taking the medicine. The aim is to reduce the number of sufferers who do not take their antibiotics properly. Evidence supporting direct supervised therapy independently is lacking.

In Africa, it primarily affects the population between the ages of 12 and 18 and young adults. However, in countries where incidence rates have fallen sharply (such as the United States), TB is generally a disease of older people and those with susceptible immune systems.

If a family member dies of TB, the health of the other family members of the infected person slowly declines. People believe that the first person who gets TB drains the souls of other family members. The type of pulmonary TB associated with tubercles was defined as a pathology by Dr Richard Morton in 1689. However, TB has a wide range of symptoms, so TB was not identified as a single disease until the late 1820s. TB was not named tuberculosis until 1839 by J. L. Sch\u00f6nlein.

Spices are one of the reasons why the Portuguese explorer Vasco Da Gama reached India and the Moluccas in Indonesia. These spices also caused the Dutch to follow them to the Moluccas. Meanwhile, the Spanish under the leadership of Magellan had already sought a way to the East by another route, namely through the Pacific Ocean and finally landed on the island of Luzon, Philippines. Some of the most important spice-producing regions in the world are India, Zanzibar, and the Maluku Islands. But most countries in the world import spices from India because India is the biggest spice center in the world. The spice trade in the Indian subcontinent began at least as early as 2000 BC (BC) with cinnamon and black pepper, while East Asians traded herbs and pepper. The practice of mummification and other needs of the Ancient Egyptians encouraged trade between countries. By 1000 BC, herb-based medical remedies were being used in China, Korea and India. In addition, spices were originally used for ritual, religious and traditional purposes.

Regarding the main theory in medieval medicine, humoralism, spices and herbs are considered important in balancing the \"humor\" in food.

Some spices that function as natural dyes are saffron flowers, paprika, turmeric, and kesumba rivet. Saffron flowers contain active compounds, namely crocin and crocetin, which produce a natural yellow-orange color. The yellow-orange color is also produced from turmeric which contains curcuminoid color pigments with curcumin compounds. Kesumba rivet can also give a brick red color because the seeds contain a color pigment, namely the bixin compound. In America, peppers are also used as food coloring, such as orange juice, cheese, sauces, and egg yolks. However, the use of saffron as a coloring agent is very limited due to the high price of this spice. So that in some countries replace the use of saffron with safflower flowers as a coloring agent.

However, the use of spices as food preservatives will be more effective when combined with other types of spices. This is because the various microorganisms in each food make not all bacteria compatible with one type of spice.

Whole dry spices can be stored for about two years, while powdered spices and seeds can last for about six months. In addition to spoiling faster, the taste of powdered spices is much less durable. note 2] Spices should be stored in closed containers, protected from sunlight and high temperatures.

In addition, temperatures that are too low also trigger changes in the characteristics of spices, such as color, aroma, and taste. Humidity that is too low can also trigger the appearance of bacteria in spices. Therefore, the best temperature for storing spices is between 10\u02daC to 15\u02daC with a relative humidity of around 55% to 60%.

The principle of electromagnetism is applied to the working systems of transformers, inductors, electric motors, electric generators and solenoids. Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re was a French physicist, mathematician and chemist. Amp\u00e8re discovered several important rules about electricity and magnetism which were then used as the basic concepts of electrodynamics and electromagnetism. He also made Ampere's law related to the electromagnet principle. The discovery of the laws of electrodynamics was the result of Amp\u00e8re's follow-up to the experiment of current flowing near a compass conducted by Hans Christian \u00d8rsted in 1820. \u00d8rsted found that a compass needle moves if it is near a wire that is electrified. Amp\u00e8re discovered that a coil behaves like a bar magnet when it is passed by an electric current. In addition, he found that the passage of electric current causes the soft iron in the coil to turn into a strong magnet and a force appears on two adjacent conductors. Amp\u00e8re then made the laws of electrodynamics using mathematical equations. In addition, Amp\u00e8re also made a galvanometer which was then used to measure electric current. Electrodynamics deals with the relationship between electromagnetism and mechanics. The focus of the concept of electrodynamics lies in the effects of electromagnetic fields on the mechanical properties of electrically charged particles. Electrodynamics forms the basis of very low-frequency instruments as well as in magnetotelluric devices and ground-penetrating radar. Electromagnetic induction is a symptom of the emergence of an electric current in an electric conductor due to a change in the magnetic field around the conductor.",

        "paragraph": "The concept of electromagnetic induction is based on the discovery of Michael Faraday and Joseph Henry in 1831. A changing magnetic field produces a potential difference called an induced electromotive force and the resulting electric current is called an induced electric current. Alternating current is an electric current whose direction changes periodically. The alternating current curve is represented by a sinusoidal shape. The principle of electromagnetic induction is used as the basis for the formation of alternating currents. Faraday's law of induction states that an electric circuit has an induced electromotive force whose value is directly proportional to the speed of change of the magnetic flux surrounding it. The line of magnetic force enclosed by a certain area in a perpendicular direction is defined as the magnetic flux. In classical electrodynamic theory, the acceleration or deceleration of the movement of electrically charged particles will result in emission of electromagnetic waves. This phenomenon is called bremsstrahlung. The bremsstrahlung phenomenon is observed in the acceleration of electrons by applying an electric voltage of up to several tens of thousands of volts. The collision of the electrons on the metal surface will drastically reduce the speed of the electron movement. The enormous deceleration causes the electrons to emit electromagnetic waves. Certain solids can change when a certain force is applied and return to their original state when the force is removed. This property is called the elasticity of solids. Solids have a limit of elasticity. If the applied force is very large and exceeds the elasticity limit, the shape of the solid cannot return to its original state. The elasticity of a solid is determined by its constituent particles and is greatly influenced by electromagnetic forces. The elasticity of a solid can be observed in a thin sheet which can be turned into a wire by pulling. The interparticle elasticity in solids is observed in springs. Potential energy and kinetic energy will increase when the solid is heated.",

        "paragraph": "Interparticle forces are not able to keep the particles in a fixed place because of the freedom of motion. These particles can then pass through each other and change the shape of the object from solid to liquid when it reaches the melting point. The Earth's magnetic field consists of a north pole which is at the south pole of the Earth, and a south pole which is at the north pole of the Earth. The field direction originates from the Earth's north pole and heads towards the Earth's south pole. At a certain angle, there are charged particles from outer space that enter Earth. These particles will move in a spiral path towards the Earth's magnetic poles. Particles experience acceleration while moving in a spiral path so that electromagnetic waves are emitted. The concentration of particles is very large as they approach the Earth's magnetic poles, so the intensity of the emission of electromagnetic waves is very high and can be observed with the eye. The phenomenon of the appearance of electromagnetic waves by the eye is called an aurora. The appearance of auroras that only occur around the poles is a real form of electromagnetism. The use of the principle of electromagnetism for the manufacture of television was first carried out by John Logie Baird in 1923. Baird utilized the principle of electromagnetic waves to transmit signals without the need for cables. Television made by Baird is capable of producing sound and images. Television signal transmission at first only reached a few meters. In 1927, Baird was transmitting a television signal from London to Glasgow. In 1928, transmission of television signals expanded from London to New York. The first television consisted of a scanning disc with a resolution of 30 pixels that came from a lens with a double spiral. The initial display of television was only able to show human faces. An electric generator is a machine that converts kinetic energy into electrical energy.",

The Code of Canon Law (CRC) of the Roman Catholic Church defines a diocese as \"that part of the people of God, which is entrusted to the bishop to care for with the cooperation of priests, in such a way that by following his pastor and united by him with the Gospel and the Eucharist in the Holy Spirit, forms a particular Church, in which the one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church of Christ is really realized and works.\" The diocese is a particular church in relation to the universal church headed by the Pope. Only the Pope has the authority to establish a diocese after hearing the reasons put forward by the bishops of the area. Generally a diocese is divided into smaller areas, called parishes, which are headed by a parish priest. All dioceses are led by a bishop, but a bishop does not necessarily lead a diocese. The bishop who presides over a diocese is called a diocesan bishop. Diocesan bishops are appointed and assigned to a diocese by the Pope, while he himself holds the position of Bishop of Rome. Meanwhile, a bishop who does not preside over a diocese is called a titular bishop. A titular bishop may be an assistant to the diocesan bishop (auxiliary bishop), a candidate for diocesan bishop (coadjutor bishop), or a former bishop (emeritus bishop) within a diocese. Within the Roman Catholic Church, there is a grouping of adjacent dioceses into an ecclesiastical province. Within this ecclesiastical province, a diocese is given the distinction of being the holder of the \"metropolitan see\", so that the diocese is also called \"metropolis\" or \"metropolitan diocese\", with its bishop being called the \"metropolitan bishop\".",

        "paragraph": "The metropolitan see is the principal episcopal see (apostolic see of bishops) within the ecclesiastical province. However, this position actually does not have any power over other dioceses other than some special powers related to supervision of these dioceses. Generally, a metropolitan diocese is considered the same as an archdiocese. Dioceses that are not metropolitan dioceses within an ecclesiastical province are called \"suffragan dioceses\", with their bishops being called \"suffragan bishops\". The creation of metropolitan dioceses and ecclesiastical provinces aims to unite adjacent dioceses into a cluster, in order to care for people who are more or less similar in culture. Therefore, the formation of an archdiocese has nothing to do with the size of the territory or the maturity of the people's faith in general. Archdiocese is the term for the area of \u200b\u200bthe diocese headed by an archbishop. Archdioceses are generally formed from a bishopric by the Pope. The terms \"archdiocese\" and \"archbishopric\" are usually considered synonymous with \"metropolitan diocese\" and \"metropolitan bishop\", which is the holder of a metropolitan see (primary episcopal see) within an ecclesiastical province, although there are some exceptions, as noted in para. -the following paragraphs. For example, the Archdiocese of Jakarta which is a metropolitan diocese within the Ecclesiastical Province of Jakarta, which also consists of the Diocese of Bogor and the Diocese of Bandung. Although very rare, there are some that make the archdiocese a suffragan diocese within an ecclesiastical province. For example, the Archdiocese of Avignon and Aix are suffragan dioceses within the ecclesiastical province whose metropolitan see is held by the Archdiocese of Marseille. Both dioceses were originally metropolitan dioceses, but both were stripped of their metropolitan status in 2002 and merged into the Ecclesiastical Province of Marseille.

Hawaii is the only state (state) in the US that is separated from the American continent and is in the form of islands as well as entering the Oceania region. These islands were discovered by James Cook, a British explorer on January 10, 1778. The original inhabitants of the Hawaiian islands are the Hawaiian people who are descendants of the Polynesians. The origins of the word Hawaii come from the Proto-Polynesian (Old Polynesian) *Sawaiki meaning \"Homeland\". Hawaii was originally still a kingdom that was successively ruled by kings Kamehameha I to Kamehameha IV, then continued by Lunailo, Kalakaua, and the last leader was Liliuokalani. In 1898, this kingdom was invaded by the United States with the help of Christian missionaries and US traders until it was claimed as the 50th US state after years of war.

The spear is a weapon for hunting and war, the part of which consists of a stick as a handle and a sharp eye or head of the spear and is sometimes hardened with other materials. Along with the spear ax, it was the first tool made by humans and in line with the development of civilization, the spearheads and axes which were originally in the form of crushed bone or stone were replaced with stronger and more durable metals. In Indonesia, the spear is the main weapon used by traditional Indonesian soldiers. This was mainly due to the scarcity of iron and other metals in Indonesia making it difficult to make swords. Therefore, the weapons that were more commonly used in Indonesia or the Malay nations used to be weapons that used less iron than swords, namely axes, machetes or machetes, and spears. Among these weapons, only spears were used only as weapons (including as hunting weapons). There is a type of spear without eyes that is often used by militia in the archipelago, namely bamboo spears made from sharpened bamboo without any reinforcement at the ends. To face this traditional Indonesian army and colonial army is a deadly stabbing weapon because they are not equipped with armor protection. The use of spears is not limited to the human species, chimpanzees and orangutans are great ape species that have been recorded using spear-like tools to hunt for food.

The word relates to the movement of village people from the seaside area to residential areas in the middle of the hills, namely Bukit Barat (Bukit Kauh) and Bukit Timur (Bukit Kangin). Another history says that the people of Tenganan came from Peneges Village (now Candi Dasa), which at that time was still part of the Bedahulu Kingdom. According to folklore, King Bedahulu had lost one of his horses and people were looking for him to the east. The horse was found dead by Ki Patih Tunjung Biru, the king's confidant.

Rickets is a disease that occurs in children in many developing countries, but if it is not handled properly it will have an impact into adulthood. The main cause is a deficiency of vitamin D, but a lack of adequate calcium in the diet can also cause rickets (severe cases of diarrhea and vomiting can be the cause of the deficiency). Although it can occur in adults, most cases occur in children suffering from malnutrition, usually as a result of starvation or starvation during the early stages of childhood. Osteomalacia is a term used to describe a similar condition occurring in adults, generally due to a deficiency of vitamin D. Osteomalacia is a condition in which bones cannot harden, so they are prone to bending or even breaking. The origin of the word \"rakitis\" may be from the Old English dialect word 'wrickken', to twist. The Greek word \"rachitis\" (\u03c1\u03b1\u03c7\u03af\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2, meaning \"inflammation of the spine\") was later adopted as the scientific term for rickets, primarily because of the words' similarity in sound. Signs and symptoms of rickets include: X-rays of advanced sufferers of rickets tend to present in the classic way: bow legs (outer curve of the long bones of the legs) and deformed chest. Changes in the skull also occur causing a distinctive \"square headed\" appearance. This defect persists into adult life if left untreated. Long-term consequences include permanent curvature or destruction of long bones, and curvature of the back.

In addition, the doctor will advise your child to bask in the sun every morning so that the bones become stronger and reduce the symptoms that arise due to rickets. Meanwhile, to correct the shape of a bent or unnatural bone, you usually have to use assistive devices or in rare cases, sufferers have to undergo bone repair surgery procedures so that they can become normal or at least better than before. Treatment involves increasing dietary intake of calcium, phosphate and vitamin D. Exposure to ultraviolet B light (sunlight when the Sun is highest in the sky), cod liver oil, halibut liver oil, and viosterol are all sources of vitamin D. An adequate amount of ultraviolet B light in Daily sun exposure and adequate supplies of calcium and phosphorus in the diet can prevent rickets. Darker skinned babies need longer to be exposed to ultraviolet light. Vitamin D replacement has been shown to correct rickets using ultraviolet light therapy methods and drugs. The recommendation is to 400 international units (IU) of vitamin D per day for infants and children. Children who don't get adequate amounts of vitamin D are at increased risk of rickets. Vitamin D is essential for allowing the body to absorb calcium for use in proper bone calcification and maintenance.

At the turn of the 5th century, the Western Church under Pope Innocent I, recognized a Bible canon which includes the four Gospels namely Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, which had previously been established at a number of regional Synods, namely the Council of Rome (382), the Synod of Hippo (393), and two Carthaginian synods (397 and 419). This canon, which corresponds to the modern Catholic canon, was used in the Vulgate, an early 5th-century translation of the Bible done by Jerome at the request of Pope Damasus I in 382. Estimates of the time at which the canonical gospels were written vary, but are no later than 100 AD So no more than 70 years after Jesus Christ left the world. The following are the approximate dates given by Raymond E. Brown, in his book \"An Introduction to the New Testament\", as a representation of the general consensus of scholars, in 1996: Meanwhile, the approximate dates are given in the NIV Study Bible: Canon The Muratorian (170 AD) gives the order in which the Gospels of Luke and John were created as follows (the preface is missing, and the remainder begins with \"where was\" and so on; the progress of the translation is placed between square brackets.

The computer is a hardware device that is closely related to technology. Computers can help a variety of human work. The word computer was originally used to describe people whose jobs were to perform arithmetic calculations, with or without assistive devices, but the meaning of this word was later transferred to the machine itself. Originally, information processing was almost exclusively related to arithmetic problems, but modern computers are used for many tasks not related to mathematics. In that sense there are tools such as the slide rule, mechanical calculators of all kinds from the abacus onwards, to all contemporary electronic computers. A better suitable term for a broad meaning such as \"computer\" is \"information processing\" or \"information processing system.\" Over the years there have been several different meanings for the word \"computer\", and several different words are now referred to as computers. The word computer has generally been used to define a person who performs arithmetic calculations, with or without an auxiliary machine. According to the Barnhart Concise Dictionary of Etymology, the word was used in English in 1646 as the word for \"one who counts\" then before 1897 also used as \"mechanical calculating device\". During World War II the word referred to working women in the United States and Britain whose job it was to calculate the passage of war artillery with calculating machines. Charles Babbage designed one of the first calculating machines called the analytical engine. In addition, various simple machine tools such as slide rules can also be said to be computers.

In a sense, this capability limit is a useful test because it recognizes \"general-purpose\" computers from earlier special-purpose devices. The definition of \"general intent\" can be formulated into the requirement that a machine must be able to emulate a universal Turing Machine. Machines that get this definition are known as Turing-complete, and the first ones appeared in 1940 amid a flurry of developments around the world. See the computer history article for more details on this period. About 20 years ago, many household devices, especially video game consoles as well as mobile phones, video cassette recorders, PDAs and myriad other household, industrial, automotive, and other electronic devices, all contained electronic circuitry like a fully qualified computer. Turing-complete above (with the caveat that the programming of these devices is often built directly into the ROM chip which will need to be replaced to change the machine programming).

While the technology used in digital computers has changed dramatically since the first computers in the 1940s (see History of computing hardware for more detail), most computers still use the Von Neumann architecture, proposed in the early 1940s by John von Neumann. . The Von Neumann architecture describes a computer with four main parts: the Arithmetic and Logical Unit (ALU), the control unit, memory, and input and output devices (collectively called I/O). These sections are connected by bundles of wire, the \"bus.\" In this system, memory is a sequence of numbered bytes (such as a \"cell\" or \"pigeon hole\"), each containing a small piece of information. This information can be commands to tell the computer what to do. Cells can contain data that the computer needs to perform a command. Each slot can contain any one, and what is now data may then become commands. A memory storing various forms of information as binary numbers. Information that is not yet in binary form will be encoded with a number of instructions that turn it into a number or sequence of numbers.

The Central Processing Unit's role is to process commands given by computer users, manage them together with the data on the computer. The processing unit or device will also communicate with input, output and storage devices to carry out interrelated instructions. In the original von Neumann architecture, it describes an Arithmetic and Logic Unit, and a Control Unit. In modern computers, these two units are located on a single integrated circuit (IC - Integrated Circuit), which is usually called the CPU (Central Processing Unit). Arithmetic and logic units, are tools that perform basic implementations such as arithmetic execution (addition, subtraction, and the like), logical execution (AND, OR, NOT), and comparison execution (for example, comparing the contents of two slots for equality). It is on this unit that the actual \"work\" is performed. The control unit stores the current command performed by the computer, instructs the ALU to execute and retrieves the information (from memory) needed to carry out that command, and moves the results back to the appropriate memory location. This unit functions to control the reading of computer program instructions.",

Output devices, decoding data into information that can be understood by computer users.In this sense, a digital computer system is an example of a data processing system.The commands discussed above are not commands like human language.Computers only have a limited number of simple commands which well-defined.The usual commands that most computers understand are \"copy the contents of cell 123, and place the copy in cell 456\", \"add the contents of cell 666 to cell 042, and place the result in cell 013\", and \"if the contents of cell 999 is 0, your next command will be in cell 345\".

Some of the larger computers differ from the above models in one key respect - they have multiple UPSs and control units working simultaneously. Moreover, some computers, which are used mostly for scientific computing and research purposes, have differed significantly from the above model, but they have found little commercial use. The function of the computer is actually quite simple in principle. The computer obtains commands and data from its memory. Command is performed, the results are stored, and the next command is achieved. This procedure is repeated until the computer is turned off. The computer program is a huge list of commands for the computer, perhaps with data in the table. Many computer programs contain millions of orders, and many of the commands are executed repeatedly. A [[Personal Computer [PC]] modern public (in 2003) can execute around 2-3 billion instructions per second. Computers do not gain their extraordinary capabilities through the ability to perform complex commands. However, they do millions of simple instructions arranged by clever people, \"programmer.\" \"Good programmers develop sets of commands to perform common tasks (for example, draw a dot on the screen) and then make those sets of instructions available to other programmers.\" Today, most computers can run several programs at once.

This field arose in the Hellenistic period in the 3rd century BC from the use of geometry to study astronomy. Trigonometry is easy to relate to in the field of right triangles (with the result that the sum of the two acute angles equals the measure of the right angles). There is also a role for other than right triangles. Since a triangle that is not a right triangle can be divided into two right triangles, many problems can be solved by calculating right triangles. Because of this, most uses of trigonometry relate to right triangles. One exception to spherical trigonometry, namely trigonometry studies in spheres or surfaces of positive relative curvature in elliptical geometry (parts that play a role in astronomical discoveries and navigation). Trigonometry in negative curvature is part of hyperbolic geometry. The beginnings of trigonometry can be traced back to Ancient Egypt and Babylon and the Indus Valley civilization, more than 3000 years ago. The Indian mathematician was a pioneer in calculating algebraic variables which are used to calculate astronomy as well as trigonometry. Lagadha was the only mathematician known today to use geometry and trigonometry for astronomical calculations in his Vedanga, Jyotisha, most of his work destroyed by Indian colonists. The Greek mathematician Hipparchus around 150 BC compiled trigonometry tables to solve triangles. Another Greek mathematician, Ptolemy around the year 100 developed trigonometric calculations further. The Silesian mathematician Bartholemeus Pitiskus published an influential work on trigonometry in 1595 and introduced the word into English and French. If one of the angles is 90 degrees and the other angles are known, then a third angle can be found, because the three angles of a triangle add up to 180 degrees.",

Other fields that use trigonometry include astronomy (and includes navigation, at sea, air and space), music theory, acoustics, optics, analysis of financial markets, electronics, probability theory, statistics, biology, medical imaging (CAT scan and ultrasound), pharmacy, chemistry, number theory (and thus cryptology), seismology, meteorology, oceanography, various branches of physics, land surveying and geodesy, architecture, phonetics, economics, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, civil engineering, computer graphics, cartography, crystallography. In the 3rd century AD, astronomers first recorded the lengths of the sides and angles of a right triangle between each of the related sides: this is it, if at least one of the side lengths and one of the angle values \u200b\u200bis known, then all angles and lengths can be determined algorithmically. These calculations are defined as trigonometric functions and are now commonplace in both pure and applied mathematics: for example to analyze basic methods such as the Fourier transform or wave equations, using trigonometric functions to understand phenomena relating to circles through many uses in fields as diverse as physics, engineering machinery and electricity, music and acoustics, astronomy, and biology. Trigonometry also has a role in finding surveying. There is a modern development of trigonometry which involves \"spread\" and \"quadrance\" instead of angles and lengths.

He became a student of Plato while in Athens. Aristotle studied from Plato for 20 years. During his life, he wrote about philosophy and other sciences, namely physics, politics, ethics, biology and psychology. Aristotle divided philosophy into four issues, namely logic, physics, metaphysics and practical knowledge. Analysis of philosophy is done using a syllogism. Aristotle's thoughts regarding logic which utilize the deductive method are used as the basis for formal logic. Aristotle also believed that the existence of science was intended to support human life. Aristotle was born in a small town called Stagira in 384 BC. The city is part of the Kalkidiki peninsula. Aristotle's upbringing was carried out by his family in Atarneus, Anatolia. This condition was caused by his father dying at a young age during a trial in Pella, Central Macedonia. His father's occupation was as a physicist. At first, Aristotle was a student of Plato. But he later rejected some of Plato's thoughts and started his own philosophical thought. Aristotle founded an educational and research center called the Lyceum. Through this place, he conveyed his thoughts which then influenced the thinking of other philosophers, theologians or scientists. Aristotle lived in an environment that supported cultural and intellectual creativity. During his lifetime, the city-states of Greece were divided by the defeat of Athens by Sparta in the Peloponnesian War in 404 BC. The long-running conflict between the Greek city-states ended when Philip II of Macedon conquered these countries and founded the Macedonian Empire.

Aristotle believed that abstractions form categories that can be applied to objects of thought. Aristotle considered that human thought transcends the three types of abstractions that make up philosophy, namely physics, mathematics and metaphysics. Man transcends physics when he begins to think while making observations. During thinking, the human mind escapes from observations that use the senses to feel everything that can be felt by its existence. General knowledge is then known from particular and real things. Physics knowledge is then formed through abstract knowledge and human reason. Furthermore, the abstraction of mathematics enables humans to understand invisible matter. Reason detaches itself from everything that can be understood. All the material characteristics of this abstraction then produce science. Meanwhile, the abstraction of metaphysics appears after humans do abstraction of physics. In the third abstraction, humans have been able to think about the reality of all matter along with its origins and purposes for its formation. Aristotle considers this abstraction to be the first philosophy. Aristotle used the term \"first philosophy\" instead of metaphysics because according to him all philosophy was derived from this abstraction. The first philosophy in Aristotle's view can be interpreted into two senses. The first is as science which is the first principle. While the second is a science that discusses existence as an existence along with the characteristics of objects. Aristotle argued that the method of discovering new knowledge and truth is divided into two. First, the inductive method and the second is the deductive method. The inductive method aims to conclude specific things into a general conclusion. Meanwhile, the deductive method only concludes the truth of two things that are certain and undoubted.",

Analysis and dialectics form the basis of logic with the core of it being the syllogism. The role of the syllogism is to be a reasoning mechanism for the correct premises to produce the correct conclusion. The syllogism becomes a formal form of deductive reasoning. Aristotle became this deductive method as the best method for obtaining new knowledge and truths based on conclusions. This method is known as the deductive syllogistic method. Aristotle became a pioneer in the collection and classification of biological species. Aristotle's inclination towards the natural sciences relates to critical analysis. The activity was carried out to find out about natural laws and natural balance. The existence of matter indicates that matter exists in a certain form. In addition, he argues that there is a purpose for the movement of objects. Aristotle's thinking about motion produces a cause-and-effect relationship that leads to the idea of \u200b\u200ban immovable first mover. The direction of his thought leads to the understanding of God. Aristotle made rhetoric an independent science with the same position as other sciences. According to Aristotle, rhetoric is not just empty words, but effective and ethical speech in conveying the truth. Aristotle argued that rhetoric cannot be used as part of other sciences. Instead, he argues that other sciences require rhetoric to provide a description of their findings.

Humans as social beings are manifested in the form of a society that is connected to each other in a biological unity based on instinct. Aristotle distinguished states into true states and true state deviations. The true state according to Aristotle is divided into monarchy, aristocracy, and constitutional. While the deviation of the true state includes tyrants, oligarchy and democracy. Exceptions are granted to democracies by adding laws to justify their application. Aristotle made the existence of law an important condition for the formation of the state. A country can provide both political benefits and disasters to its citizens. The determinant is the condition of the fulfillment of freedom, human rights, trust and self-esteem of citizens. Aristotle's political views are normative. Politics is defined as a means of forming a society with great opportunities to gain happiness. Through politics, people can develop talents, increase friendship, and uphold morality. Meanwhile, the highest power in a country is referred to as sovereignty. Aristotle examines sovereignty which is defined as a superior element in several types of constitutions with a political unit whose number can be single or many. Aristotle is one of the philosophers who adheres to the view of natural law. He makes reason as a determinant of absolute justice.

Empirical evidence has not been widely used in justifying a thought. At this time, psychology was still part of philosophy. In Ancient Greece, Aristotle became one of the figures who put forward the theory of psychology together with Plato. He argued that a body that has organs is composed of a fundamental component called the soul. The position of the soul in the organic body is as the first and main component. The soul is used as a constituent of life on matter that makes it have a special structure. Humans in this view are formed from souls that are immanent. It is the existence of this soul that makes a human being a human. Aristotle divides the elements of communication including speakers, messages and listeners. He believes that communication has occurred when the speaker has been able to change the attitude of the listener through the message in the conversation. The type of communication put forward by Aristotle is related to rhetoric and speech so that the nature of communication only occurs in one direction. Aristotle developed a type of argumentation called the movement argument to explain the existence of God. In Aristotle's view, God is an immovable mover. All movement that occurs in the universe is caused by God. Aristotle saw that God only plays a role in creating all movements in the universe, but does not take care of the universe and its creations anymore. God in Aristotle's view does not know the small things that happen in the universe. Aristotle's view is contrary to the religious view of the nature of divinity.

Everything that exists in the world is judged based on the good and bad that it has and is the basis of its existence. Aristotle believed that humans who have these two types of wisdom will be wise humans. Aristotle considered logic as a science that is used to draw conclusions about something precisely. Logic is used as the basis for all kinds of knowledge. He conveyed his thoughts on logic in a collection of writings called To Organon. This name means the method of obtaining scientific knowledge. In these writings, Aristotle gives priority to the question of the syllogism. To Organon is divided into six chapters, each of which discusses a particular concept. Sequentially, the concepts discussed are categories, propositions, syllogisms, proof, the art of arguing and fallacies of thought. To Organon is a work that makes logic a science. The pattern of knowledge development that it produces starts from the formation of ideas, then makes decisions, and ends with the thought process. Politica is Aristotle's writing which discusses the rule of law. The formulation of the state in Aristotle's thought is not related to humans as government. A country is governed by laws that set standards of justice and decency. The law plays a role in forming a good human person with moral norms and a high sense of justice.

Magma that comes out of the belly of a volcano is an erupting volcano or volcanism. Magma is an incandescent liquid that is found in the earth's layers with a very high temperature, which is estimated to be more than 1,000\u00b0C. The liquid magma that comes out of the earth is called lava. The temperature of the released lava can reach 700-1,200\u00b0C. Volcanic eruptions carrying rocks and ashes can erupt up to a radius of 18 km or more, while the lava can flood up to a radius of 90 km. The types and shapes of volcanoes vary because the degree of thickness and depth of magma that forms volcanoes is different. Volcanic eruptions occur due to magma deposits in the bowels of the earth which are pushed out by high pressure gas. It is from eruptions like this that volcanoes are formed. The results of volcanic eruptions are: volcanic gas, lava and sand flows and hot rock, lava, landslides, earthquakes, eruption ash, hot clouds.

Lutetium is the hardest and densest metal in the lanthanide group, which is located in the last column of the group on the periodic table. Lutetium was first discovered in 1907 by Baron Carl Auer von Welsbach, Georges Urbain, and Charles James while each of them was conducting research in different locations. They examined a mineral thought to consist purely of ytterbium, but in the end it was discovered that this mineral was also a combination of lutetium and several other chemical elements. Because Georges Urbain took the swift step to publicize his discovery, the naming of the chemical element lutetium was chosen and officially recognized globally. Lutetium has the atomic number 71 and the electron configuration Xe] 4f145d16s2. Lutetium is resistant to corrosion and is a mixture of white and silver in color. The atomic mass of lutetium is large compared to its size, so it has high boiling and melting points. Actually, the electrons of the element lutetium do not completely fill the d orbitals, but they are still classified as lanthanides because they have physical and chemical characteristics that are very similar to the 14 other chemical elements of the lanthanide group. Lutetium has 59 isotopes, but only two are stable, namely Lu-175 and Lu-176. 97.41% of the total lutetium found on earth is Lu-175, while only 2.59% is Lu-176.

Donations can be in the form of goods or services (eg education) which are given free of charge without any coercion. Bederma is taught by a number of religions and customs. The word \"demon\" in Indonesian comes from the Sanskrit word \u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e, dharma, which means decency, virtue, right conduct, or good deeds. Another term for giving is \"alms\", from the Arabic word \u0635\u062f\u0642\u0629, \u1e63adaqah, which means any kind of good deed towards others done sincerely. In Judaism, tzedakah (Hebrew: \u05e6\u05d3\u05e7\u05d4, \u1e63edakah\u200e, literally means truth, but is also commonly interpreted as generosity) refers to the obligation of adherents of Judaism to act righteously and fairly. Giving tzedakah is now seen as a continuation of the practice of ma'ser ani or setting aside one-tenth of crops for the poor, as well as other charitable practices mandated in the Bible, such as allowing the poor to reap crops that grow in the corners of the fields, and let anyone enjoy the crops grown during Smithah (Sabbath year). Tzedakah, accompanied by prayer and repentance, is considered as an antidote to the reward of bad deeds. In Judaism, tzedakah (generosity) is considered one of the noblest deeds a human being can perform. Jewish farmers were prohibited from harvesting crops that grew in the corners of their fields or picking up crops that fell, so that they could be used by the poor. The great Jewish clergyman, Musa bin Maimun, once compiled a list of acts of generosity. According to Musa bin Maimun, the most correct act of generosity is to enable the recipient to become an independent person so that he is able to act generously towards others.",

Sadaqah means giving charity voluntarily, while zakat means giving charity according to the provisions of Islamic law in order to fulfill obligations as adherents of Islam and members of the community. Therefore, although zakat plays a larger role for Islamic charitable works, sadaqah seems to be more synonymous with 'giving'. Zakat is the third pillar (saka guru) of the five pillars of Islam. There are various regulations regarding the implementation of zakat, but in general, people are required to give 2.5% of their savings and business income, and 5\u201310% of their crops to the poor. The recipients of zakat include people who have almost nothing, people who have very low incomes, people who cannot afford to pay debts, people who run out of funds while traveling, and other parties who need help. The general principle of zakat is zakaah, that is, the rich must give to the poor. One of the important principles in Islam is the teaching that everything belongs to Allah, so wealth can only be kept as a deposit to be managed. The literal meaning of the word zakat is \"purify\", \"develop\", and \"stimulate growth\". According to Islamic law, zakat is worship. The wealth of a Muslim is purified through the act of setting aside a part of it for those who need it, just as plants are pruned to rejuvenate them and stimulate the growth of new shoots. Zakat is an amount of money that must be submitted by every adult Muslim, male or female, who is sane (spiritually healthy), independent, and financially capable, to be used as a grant for certain parties. These particular parties are detailed in surah At-Taubah verse 60: \"Verily, zakat is only for the needy, the poor, amil zakat, whose hearts are softened (converts), to (liberate) slaves, to (liberate) people debtors, for the path of Allah and for those who are on their way, as an obligation from Allah.",

The mandatory nature of Zakat is established in the Al-Qur'an, the Sunnah (or Hadith), and the consensus of the companions of the Prophet and scholars. Allah says in Surah At-Taubah verse 34-35: \"O you who believe, most of the Jewish scholars and Christian monks really consume people's property in a vain way, and they prevent (people) from the way of God. And those who hoard gold and silver and do not spend it in the way of God, then tell them, (that they will get) a painful punishment, on the day when the gold and silver will be heated in hell, then their foreheads will be burned, their stomachs and backs (and it was said) to them: 'This is your wealth that you kept for yourselves, so taste now (the consequences of) what you kept.'\" (Al-Qur'an 9:34-35). Muslims from time to time have agreed on the obligatory nature of paying Zakat on gold and silver, and Zakat on various other means of exchange. Zakat becomes obligatory when the amount of money has reached or exceeded a certain limit called nisab. Zakat is not obligatory if the amount of money owned is still under nisab. The nisab (or lowest amount) for gold and gold changeable is 20 miskals, which is around 85 grams of pure gold. One miscal is approximately equivalent to 4.25 grams. The nisab for silver and silver exchange is 200 dirhams, which is around 595 grams of pure silver. The nisab for other types of money and exchange instruments is adjusted to the nisab for gold; nisab for money equivalent to the price of 85 grams of 999 gold (pure gold) on the day of Zakat payment.

The owner of the money must first subtract the amount of money he has saved by the amount of money he has borrowed from other people; if the remaining amount reaches the nisab, then the Zakat that must be paid is calculated. If the owner of the money has an amount of money that has reached the nisab at the beginning of the lunar year, but the amount of his wealth then increases throughout the year, then the owner of the money must add the amount of increase in his wealth to the amount of money that has reached the nisab at the beginning of the year, then then calculate the zakat. he must pay, namely 2.5% of the total amount of money he has at the end of the lunar year. There are a number of minor differences among schools of fiqh regarding how zakat is calculated. Each Muslim calculates the amount of zakat that must be paid by himself. Almost all zakat calculations include an annual payment of 2.5% of the total capital owned by a person. A pious person can also give alms at will in the form of sadaqah, and is advised to do so in secret.

Money cannot be accepted by a Theravadin monk, whether given as a substitute for food or with food, because according to the pratimoksa (Pali: patimokkha) training rules the acceptance of money is an offense that deserves confiscation and admission of guilt. In countries adhering to the Mahayana school, the practice of benediction is almost extinct. In China, Korea and Japan, local culture rejects the idea of \u200b\u200bgiving food to 'begging' monks, and there is no tradition of creating merit through giving alms to monks who practice begging.",

In Japan, the practice of takuhatsu which is carried out every week or every month replaces the practice of begging. In the Himalayan countries, the large number of monks makes the implementation of alms potentially a burden for the families around the monasteries. Competition with other religions in asking for public support also makes the practice of begging difficult and even endangers the safety of the soul; the first monks in the Silla Kingdom in Korea are said to have been beaten by people because their numbers were so few at that time. In Buddhism, both the act of \"giving\" and the act of \"giving\" are called \"d\u0101na.\" The act of giving is one of the three paths of religious practice formulated by the Buddha for lay people, namely d\u0101na, precepts and b\u0101wan\u0101. In Buddhism there is a paradox that the more people give \u2013 and the more people give selflessly \u2013 the more prosperous (in a broad sense) that person will be. Through the act of giving, one destroys the greed that can make life even more miserable. Generosity is also shown towards other beings, both as a means of creating merit and to help the recipient. In the Mahayana school of tradition, although the Three Jewels of refuge are the basis of the greatest merit, it is equally beneficial to view other beings as possessing the Buddha's nature and make offerings to the pure form of Buddha to reside in them. Generosity towards other beings is emphasized in the Mahayana school as one of the perfections (paramita) as set forth in Lama Tsongkhapa's treatise entitled 'The Brief Points of the Graded Path' (Tibetan: lam-rim bsdus-don): Willingness the one round for giving is a wish-fulfilling gem capable of granting the wishes of wandering beings. It is the sharpest weapon for breaking the knot of avarice. It is the guide to bodhisattva behavior (enlightened beings) that enhances self-confidence and courage, and is a the foundation for the proclamation of your fame and honor throughout the universe. Realizing this, the wise and wholesome cling for their lives to the noble path that is (always willingly) completely surrendering their body, property, and good abilities. Lamas who are ever vigilant have undergone such practices. If you also want to seek i liberation, it would be nice if you temper yourself with the same practice.",

The reasons underlying the act of giving play an important role in the development of spiritual excellences. The sutra books (Pali: sutta) contain various reasons that encourage people to be generous.

Bederma is charity towards less fortunate people. During the life of Jesus' apostles, Christians were taught that giving alms is an expression of love first revealed by God through Jesus' self-sacrifice as a charity for the salvation of the faithful. Offerings are part of the celebration of Roman Catholic Masses, Anglican Eucharistic worship, and Lutheran services when alms are collected. A number of Protestant Christian denominations, such as the Baptists or Methodist churches, also practice alms-gathering, but more often refer to it as a \"tithes and offerings\" collection. A number of Christian denominations practice regular special alms-gatherings called charity offerings to help the poor, people who have been struck by misfortunes or calamities such as house fires or large medical bills.

Some people set aside a ninth of their income to give away. Some others divide their income (after deducting taxes) into four parts. The first quarter is set aside to pay for daily needs, the second quarter is set aside for the free works of noble poets, the third quarter is set aside for charity, and the fourth quarter is set aside for savings.

This hypothesis about social change grows out of resistance to revolutionary socialism, which argues that revolution is necessary for fundamental structural changes to occur. Reformism must be distinguished from pragmatic reform: reformism is the view that an accumulation of reforms can lead to the formation of a socio-economic system that is completely different from current forms of capitalism and democracy, whereas pragmatic reform represents an effort to maintain the status quo against fundamental and structural changes. There are two kinds of reformism. The former have no desire to bring socialism or fundamental economic changes to society and are used to resist structural change. The second is based on the opinion that while reform is not socialism itself, it can help unite its supporters for the cause of the revolution by popularizing socialism among the working class. The debate over the ability of social democratic reformism to lead the socialist transformation of society has been going on for a century. Reformism was criticized for being paradoxical: trying to overcome the existing capitalist economic system, but also trying to improve the conditions of capitalism so that it actually made capitalism look more acceptable to society. According to Rosa Luxemburg, under reformism, \"(capitalism) is not overthrown, but on the contrary will be strengthened by the development of social reforms.\" In a similar vein, Stan Parker of the Socialist Party of Great Britain argued that reformism was a transfer of power away from the socialists and limited, because they had to obey the logic of capitalism.

This positivism approach then forms objective truth claims obtained through scientific processes. The empiricism approach is used to analyze the problem of educational equity through a combination of methodology and substance.

Hamburg was founded in 825. With an area of \u200b\u200b755 km2 and crossed by the river Elbe, this city is classified as a cosmopolitan city thanks to the reputation of its sons such as the famous classical composers Felix Mendelssohn and Johannes Brahms and director and theater player Gustaf Grudgens of the Deutsche Schauspielhaus. The city of Hamburg has a strong publishing industry which began to develop in the 17th century. The physical character of this city is marked by the canal system that divides it. Hamburg also has beautiful lakes, parks and museums including the Kunsthalle (1868), Museum of Arts and Crafts (1877), Museum of Ethnology and Prehistory (1878). Its official name reflects Hamburg's history as a member of the Hanseatic League in medieval times and an independent imperial city from the Holy Roman Empire. Prior to the German Unification in 1871, Hamburg was a fully sovereign city-state, and prior to 1919 it formed a civil republic governed constitutionally by the hereditary great burgher class or Hanseaten. Struck by disasters such as the Great Hamburg Fire, the North Sea floods of 1962 and military conflicts including bombing raids during World War II, the city has managed to recover and become more prosperous after each disaster. The history of the city of Hamburg is both tragic and romantic. Situated between the Elbe and Alster rivers, Hammaburg castle was built in 825 and became the home of the Archbishop of Ansgar, which made it a base for expanding Christian influence over the pre-Christian population of Northern Europe.",

In the 13th century AD, Hamburg became part of the Hanseatic League, which included the Baltic trading cities of L\u00fcbeck, Breslau and Danzig. This league strengthened the economy of the cities of the unified North Germany. Trade flourished, and Hamburg became a major port of trade between Russia and Flanders with its position as ruler and guardian of the river Elbe. Although the Hanseatic League broke up in the late Middle Ages, Hamburg continued to grow. Its growth has outpaced L\u00fcbeck. The Hamburg stock exchange was founded in 1558. Between 1616-1625, Hamburg built its own defenses and also built public facilities such as an orphanage built in 1604 and a hospital built in 1605. In 1625, the city strengthened its defenses so that it could continue its trading activities went through hard times in the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648) which left other cities in a slump. It's just that when it was attacked by the French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte in 1830, Hamburg was subdued and then dissolved in the French Empire. However, after Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte fell, Hamburg was able to reclaim its former glory as a free Hanseatic port city. Trade also expanded to Africa, America and Asia. Since rebuilding the damage suffered by its port during World War II, Hamburg has reclaimed its position as Germany's main port and has become one of the most important ports in Northern Europe. In the early 1960s, members of the world famous band from Great Britain, The Beatles often performed regularly in the city of Hamburg and became so famous that it can be said that this city was the starting point of the band's success.",

        "paragraph": "Editor page that has logged out learn more A transformer or transformer is an electrical device that converts one form of electrical energy into another form of electrical energy. The value of the electric voltage generated by the transformer is determined by the need for electrical energy. Types of transformers include step-up transformers, step-down transformers, measuring transformers and electronic transformers. Transformers can be installed from one electrical circuit to another, or several circuits. The varying current in each coil of a transformer produces a varying magnetic flux in the transformer core, which induces varying electromotive forces in the other coils wound around the same core. Electrical energy can be transferred between separate coils without a metallic (conductive) connection between the two circuits. Faraday's law of induction, discovered in 1831, describes the effect of the voltage induced in each coil due to a change in the magnetic flux surrounded by the coil. Transformers are most commonly used to step up low AC voltages at high currents (step-up transformers) or step down high AC voltages at low currents (step-down transformers) in power applications, and to interconnect stages in signal processing circuits. Transformers can also be used for isolation, where the voltage equals the output voltage, with the separate coils not being electrically bonded to each other. Since the invention of the first constant potential transformer in 1885, transformers have become essential for the transmission, distribution, and utilization of alternative electric current power. A wide variety of transformer designs are found in power electronics and electrical applications. Transformer sizes range from RF transformers with a volume of less than one cubic centimeter, to units weighing hundreds of tons used to connect power grids.

The windings are wound around a very high magnetic permeability core so that all magnetic flux passes through both the primary and secondary windings. With the voltage source connected to the primary winding and the load connected to the secondary winding, the transformer current flows in the direction shown and the core's magnetomotive force cancels out to zero. According to Faraday's law, since the same magnetic flux passes through the primary and secondary windings in an ideal transformer, a voltage is induced in each winding in proportion to the number of turns. The ratio of the voltage turns of a transformer is directly proportional to the ratio of the turns of the windings. The identity of an ideal transformer is shown in Eq. Figure 5 is a reasonable approximation for a typical commercial transformer, with the voltage ratio and turns ratio both inversely proportional to the corresponding current ratio. The impedance of the referenced load to the primary circuit is equal to the ratio of turns squared to the load impedance of the secondary circuit.

The inside of the current transformer is composed of a primary winding and a secondary winding. The number of primary windings is very small, while the number of secondary windings is very large.

A step down transformer has fewer secondary turns than the primary winding, so it functions as a step down. This type of transformer is very easy to find, especially in AC-DC adapters. This type of transformer consists of only one electrically continuous winding, with a center tap. In this transformer, part of the primary winding is also a secondary winding.

But this type of transformer cannot provide electrical isolation between the primary winding and the secondary winding. In addition, the autotransformer cannot be used as a step-up voltage of more than a few times (usually not more than 1.5 times). A variable autotransformer is actually an ordinary autotransformer whose middle leads can be switched, providing a variable primary-secondary turns ratio. An isolation transformer has the same number of secondary windings as the primary winding, so that the secondary voltage is the same as the primary voltage. But on some designs, the secondary winding is made a little more to compensate for the loss. Transformer like this serves as insulation between two prop. For audio applications, this type of transformer has been largely replaced by coupling. Pulse transformers are transformers specifically designed to provide pulse wave output. This type of transformer uses a core material that quickly saturates so that once the primary current reaches a certain point, the magnetic flux stops changing. Since the induced emf in the secondary winding is only formed when the magnetic flux changes, the transformer only gives an output when the core is not saturated, that is, when the current in the primary winding reverses. A three-phase (3-phase) transformer is actually three transformers connected specifically to each other. The primary winding is usually star connected (Y) and the secondary winding is delta connected (\u0394{\\displaystyle \\Delta }).

When the winding surrounds the core, the transformer forms the core; when the winding is surrounded by a core, the transformer takes the form of a shield. The shield shape design is probably more common than the core shape design for distribution transformer applications because of the relative ease of stacking the cores around the windings. Core shape design tends to be, as a general rule, more economical, and therefore more common, than shield shape design for high-voltage power transformer applications at the lower end of their voltage range and power rating (less than or equal to, nominally, 230 kV or 75 MVAs). Shielded transformers are characterized by a better kVA to weight ratio, better short-circuit strength characteristics, and higher immunity to transit damage. It is a general rule that the life expectancy of electrical insulation is halved for every 7\u00b0C to 10\u00b0C increase in operating temperature (an example of applying the Arrhenius equation). Transformer oil is a highly refined mineral oil that cools the windings and insulation by circulating within the transformer tank. Mineral oil and paper insulation systems have been studied and used extensively for more than 100 years. It is estimated that 50% of power transformers will last 50 years of use, that the average failure life of a power transformer is about 10 to 15 years, and that about 30% of power transformer failures are caused by insulation failure and overload. Isolation shall be provided between the individual windings of the windings, between the windings, between the windings and the core, and at the winding terminals.

Within limits, the entire roll may be placed in a mold, and resin sprinkled around it as a solid block, encapsulating the roll. Larger transformers are equipped with high-voltage insulated bushings made of polymer or porcelain. Large bushings can be complex structures because they must require careful control of the electric field gradient without allowing transformer oil to leak. Transformers can be classified in many ways, as follows: Transformer testing aims to determine the operating characteristics of the transformer. There are four parameters used to find out, namely equivalent resistance, leakage reactance, core loss conductance, and magnetic susceptibility. Measurement of equivalent resistance and leakage reactance is based on the primary and secondary coils in the transformer. Meanwhile, the measurement of the core loss conductance is the opposite of the equivalent resistance, and the measurement of magnetic susceptibility is the opposite of the core loss reactance. There are two types of tests given to these four parameters, namely zero load testing and short circuit testing. The efficiency of a transformer can be found by the formula\u03b7=PoPi100%{\\displaystyle \\eta ={\\frac {P_{o}}{P_{i}}}\\,100\\%}As a result of losses in the transformer.

DNA helicase has EC number 3.6.4.12 and plays a role in the process of DNA replication. Unlike the DNA helicase, the RNA helicase has the EC number 3.6.4.13 and plays a role in the translation process. The meaning of the EC number 3 is that this enzyme belongs to the class of hydrolytic enzymes. The mechanism of action of the DNA helicase is to form a nucleoprotein complex, called a replisome, with primase and cut the bonds in the DNA double helix into 2 single DNA strands. The stability of the replisome will affect the replication process in the lagging strand, especially the length of the Okazaki fragment formed. The more stable the replisome, the longer the Okazaki fragment will be and the easier the task of RNA polymerase will be. The role of helicases is also seen in DNA repair and DNA recombination in all organisms. DNA helicase was first isolated from the bacterium Escherichia coli in 1976. Since then, helicase has been isolated from various other eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms. DNA helicase requires energy from ATP hydrolysis to unwind the double-stranded DNA. Helicase will walk down the DNA chain. The mechanism of action of the helicase is to disrupt the hydrogen bonds between the two strands. The characteristic of RNA helicase is that it is highly conserved enzyme. Even so, RNA helicase plays an important role in many metabolic processes such as translation, RNA repair, and recombination. Even though DNA helicase and RNA helicase have different functions, there is one helicase that is able to work to open DNA and RNA strands, namely Hepatitis C Virus Helicase. NS3(HCV N53). The performance of HCV N53 is influenced by 2 catalytic sides, namely W501 and V432. W501 is an aromatic ring residue and plays a role in the process of opening the RNA chain. When the W501 catalytic site is replaced with a non-aromatic residue, the RNA unwinding process is disrupted, while the DNA unwinding process is relatively unaffected by the presence of this residue.",

The name Xiongnu may be a cognate for the name of the Huns, but the evidence for this view is controversial. Chinese sources from the 3rd century BC report that the Xiongnu founded an empire under Modu Chanyu, their supreme leader after 209 BC. This empire stretched beyond the borders of modern Mongolia. After defeating the previously dominant Yuezhi in the 2nd century BC, the Xiongnu became the dominant power in the steppes of eastern Asia. They are active in Siberia, Mongolia, western Manchuria, and the Chinese provinces of Inner Mongolia, Gansu and Xinjiang. The relationship between the early dynasties of China and the Xiongnu was complex, with repeated periods of military conflict and intrigue, as well as exchanges of tribute, trade, and marriage agreements. Sima Qian writes, based on earlier Chinese records (Babmu Chronicles), that the ruling clan of the Xiongnu were descendants of the Chunwei (\u6df3\u7dad \"Chun tribe\"), possibly the sons of Jie, the last ruler of the possibly legendary Xia Dynasty (c. 2070\u20131600 BC).

This activity increases nutrient reserves in the soil and is an important part of humus formation. The ability of Actinobacteria to live in a low nutrient environment and to consume lognocellulose (lignin and cellulose, substances that make up wood, usually difficult for most soil bacteria to digest) causes Actinobacteria to dominate the karst rock area.

In China, the dragon is considered a wise and majestic figure like a god. The dragon is the only mythical animal that is a symbol of Shio. The Minangkabau culture is familiar with the Sianok Gorge fable created by the Dragon. Dragon-shaped decorations are also very closely related to Javanese culture, generally found in gamelan, temple doors and gates, as a symbol of guard. The Dayak people also describe the Dragon as the ruler of the underworld, and the hornbills as the ruler of the upper world. Dragons in eastern civilization have a place of honor, because even though they have tremendous power that can destroy, they are not arbitrary and can even protect. The dragon or snake in the view of most Indonesians is considered a symbol of the underworld. Before the Hindu Age (Neolithicum), in Indonesia there was an opinion that this world was divided into two parts, namely the underworld and the upper world, and each had contradictory characteristics. The underworld, among others, is symbolized by the earth, moon, dark, water, snake, turtle, crocodile. While the upper world is symbolized by the sun, light, top, horse, eagle. Such views are also almost evenly distributed across Asian nations. In the story of the Mahabarata as well as in the views of most Indonesians themselves before the Hindu Age, dragons or snakes were always associated with water, while water was absolutely necessary as a means of agriculture. In the Chinese tradition there is also a creature named Liong or Lung which is generally translated into Indonesian as dragon.",

Empiricism is one of the three schools of philosophy of science in the Western world. Philosophical thinking on empiricism has a nature that is contrary to rationalism. Empiricism thought was pioneered by Thomas Hobbes as a reaction against rationalism. The development of empiricism thought took place rapidly in England and the surrounding area during the renaissance during the 17th to 18th centuries. Empiricism was first developed in England by John Locke (1632\u20131704), but has more influenced thinkers in the United States, particularly in the fields of environmental preservation and environmental psychology. Supporting figures come from adherents of Western philosophy, including Francis Bacon, Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, and David Hume. The empiricism of its leaders has contributed to the development of the scientific field. These figures include John Locke (social science and scientific method), George Berkeley (physics, mathematics and theology), and David Hume (historical science and science). Empiricism is also the basis for the development of philosophy in positivism.

The laws of mechanism are considered as the basis of the processes that take place in the world, including humans. Then, another idea about empiricism was put forward by John Locke (1632\u20131704) who argued that the source of knowledge received by reason comes from experience. The empiricism of thought was further developed by George Berkeley who argued that material substances do not exist at all, only observable characteristics exist. When the world entered the Industrial Revolution, humans began to rely on science and technology to determine policies to address various social problems in society. Mysticism and beliefs about the occult and magic have begun to be abandoned by society. Social problems began to be solved by compiling and testing various scientific theories. The benchmarks used are empiricism and the scientific method. The main teachings of empiricism can be divided based on their views on sources of knowledge, methods of thinking and models of reasoning used. The source of knowledge in the view of empiricism is only from experience. The method of thinking he uses is through empirical evidence and experiments. While the reasoning model he uses is inductive reasoning. The main teachings of empiricism are contrary to rationalism, because rationalism considers knowledge recognition by the senses to be unclear. Meanwhile, empiricism believes that the senses are the perfect and clearest means of recognizing knowledge. In another sense, empiricism prioritizes the use of a posteriori elements, while rationalism prioritizes the use of a priori elements.

The epistemological view of empiricism is based on the principle that everything that exists in the mind exists in the form of sensory data. The epistemology of empiricism is based on the works of John Locke and David Hume. In his second thought, phenomenalism-nominalism is used as the basis of science. Something is considered as knowledge if it is a phenomenon that can be experienced directly. Status as knowledge cannot be given to statements that do not refer to independent objects. Empiricism believes that the entire structure of science can be known using the induction method. Correspondence theory is a theory which argues that knowledge can be true and become truth when it is in accordance with reality. An idea, concept or theory is only considered correct if it corresponds to reality. Revealing the reality is seen as the main thing, because the truth will be known naturally after the fact is revealed. Correspondence theory is related to empiricism because experience and sensory observation are used as the main source of acquiring knowledge. Observation, experiment or testing empirically becomes something valuable in the view of correspondence theory to reveal the actual reality. Correspondence theory also emphasizes the use of knowledge and a posteriori way of working. Adila alias STIPRAM student lady. Aristotle used an empiricist approach to establish the foundations of science. He relies on the ability of the senses, especially sight (eyes) and hearing (ears). The use of this approach is then referred to as the inductive method or empiricism method.

Locke's thinking rejects Plato's opinion regarding the existence of innate ideas prior to the acquisition of experience. It rejects all ideas that support the existence of an innate idea. The empiricism developed by John Locke is also related to education. John Locke's empiricism is related to his view of the knowledge possessed by humans at birth. He believes that humans are born in a state of complete lack of knowledge. Locke also believed that children's development, especially in education, was fully influenced by the environment. Thomas Hobbes argues that the introduction of everything is always preceded by sensory experience. Truth is only possessed by something that can be felt by the senses. He believes that intellectual recognition is the result of the sum of the same sensory data, but in a different way. Hobbes considered the system of matter composed of the world and matter as his object of recognition. The existence of recognition object takes place continuously because of the law of mechanism. In the history of modern philosophy, Hobbes' thought is the first materialistic system. David Hume is a British empiricist figure. The empirical thoughts he put forward were radical. He interprets the substance of knowledge as a repetition of experience so that the whole knowledge is a total experience. David Hume's views tend to be skeptical because he only recognizes the results of knowledge by the senses broadly. He considers experience as a fantasy and assumption.

In addition, a phenomenon is understood objectively and value-free through reductionism, universalism and absolute freedom. Epistemologically, empiricism is a notion of thought which is the basis for the construction of knowledge in modern science. Observations and experiences are used to carry out scientific hypothesis testing. This empirical knowledge completely relies on all kinds of human senses to form knowledge of the state of the world around humans. The content of this empirical knowledge includes ideas that are in accordance with empirical facts. The educational philosophy of pragmatism is a school of educational philosophy that emerged in America. This philosophical school is influenced by British empiricism. The main view is that humans can know something that has been experienced. Figure thinkers include Herakleitos, Charles Sanders Peirce, William James, and John Dewey. In the Western world, education with pragmatism is the result of a combination of empiricism and positivism. Empiricism is a major part of positivism. One of the influences of empiricism on positivism is the use of verification methods. The name positivism itself comes from the word \"positive\" which is related to the word \"factual\". The word \"factual\" is related to all facts that have empirical evidence. Sensory recognition and observation are then used in positivism to introduce knowledge into research.

Empiricism is utilized in positivism to respond to the limitations of speculative philosophy. This limitation, for example, was put forward by Immanuel Kant. The flow of positivism was introduced by Comte de Claude Henri de Rouvray Saint-Simon (1760\u20131825) and developed by Auguste Comte (1798\u20131857). In the social science family, the positivism paradigm combines empiricism and rationalism. The combination of empiricism and rationalism also makes social reality in the view of positivism dualistic because it examines the existence of both subjects and objects. This positivism approach then forms objective truth claims obtained through scientific processes. The empiricism approach is used to analyze the problem of educational equity through a combination of methodology and substance. The assumption given as the cause of unequal opportunities in obtaining education is the existence of differences in social class with different interests. This social class is generally divided into populists and elites. The populists get an education by working hard, while the elite get an education by maintaining the status quo. Modern democracy is closely related to empiricism in terms of forms and sentiments. The idea of \u200b\u200ba single visionary or rationality was replaced by the concept of the greatest number of observations. Empiricism also substitutes the qualitative character of rationalism for the number of individual cases collected. Empiricism has three weaknesses related to its characteristics. First, empiricism only relies on experience that is not directly related to objective reality when it acts as a concept. The meaning of experience is less clear to serve as a source of systematic knowledge.

In Sanskrit, the term Bodhisattva consists of two words, namely bodhi which means enlightenment or illumination, and sattwa which means creature. Bodhisattva also refers to the Buddha in his previous life. In Mahayana teachings, Bodhisattvas take a vow not to enter nirvana until all beings have attained Buddhahood. This means that he postponed entering nirvana and chose to descend to earth to sacrifice himself to help other beings achieve enlightenment. That's why Bodhisattvas are known to have compassion and selflessness and self-sacrifice. This is not the same as in the traditional Theravada tradition, beings who attain enlightenment are Arhats, not Buddhas. The Bodhisattva meaning in the Pali Canon (collection of scriptures on Theravada teachings) and Theravada tradition does not say that a Bodhisattva makes a promise not to become enlightened until everyone else is enlightened. This is an innovation from Mahayana. So a Bodhisatta and a Bodhisattva are different things. Bodhisattvas are much admired in famous art, including one of the tallest statues of the Bodhisattva at Puning Monastery in China, built in 1755. The Pali word Bodhisattva is used by the Buddha in the Pali Canon to refer to himself in previous and present lives towards enlightenment and in the period when he was still moving towards liberation. Siddhartha Gautama's life as a Bodhisattva is recorded in the Jataka Book. When Siddhartha Gautama talks about himself first, he uses the term \"when I was a Bodhisattva\".",

The second model is equipped with three buttons. In 1970, Douglas Engelbart introduced a mouse that could determine the X-Y position on a computer screen, this mouse was known as the X-Y Position Indicator (X-Y Position Indicator). The most common form of mouse has two main buttons, one each on the top left and top right which can be pressed. Modern mice are generally equipped with a scroll button which can also be pressed as a third button. However, Macintosh-based computers usually use a single-button mouse. The mouse works by capturing motion with a ball that hits a hard, flat surface. More modern mice do not use the ball anymore, but use optical beams to detect motion. In addition, some are already using wireless technology, whether based on radio, infrared light, or Bluetooth. Currently, the latest technology allows mice to use laser systems, enabling resolutions reaching 2,000 dots per inch (dpi) to 4,800 dots per inch.

Condensation occurs when a vapor is cooled to a liquid, but it can also occur when a vapor is compressed (that is, the pressure is increased) to a liquid, or it undergoes a combination of cooling and compression. The liquid that has condensed from the vapor is called condensate. A device used to condense vapor into a liquid is called a condenser. A condenser is generally a cooler or heat exchanger that is used for various purposes, has a variety of designs, and many sizes from hand-held to very large. Condensation of vapor into a liquid is the opposite of evaporation and is an exothermic (heat-releasing) process. The water that shows up on the outside of a cold glass of water on a hot day is condensation. Water vapor in the air that naturally condenses on cold surfaces is called dew. Water vapor will only condense on a surface if the surface has a lower dew point than water vapor, or water vapor has reached an equilibrium in the air, such as saturated humidity. The air dew point is the temperature that must be reached so that condensation begins to occur in the air. Water molecules take some of the heat from the air. As a result, the temperature of the atmosphere will drop slightly. In the atmosphere, it is the condensation of water vapor that causes clouds to form. Small water molecules in large quantities will become water droplets due to the influence of temperature, and can fall to earth as rain. This is what is called the water cycle.

However, because the human ability to absorb experience and education is not the same. So there is no ability of reason between humans that are really the same. Reason comes from the Arabic word 'aql which in language means binding and understanding of something. Another meaning of reason is the power of thought (to understand something), the ability to understand the environment, or is another word for mind and memory. With reason, we can see ourselves in relation to our surroundings, we can also develop conceptions about our own character and condition, and take precautions against this sense of uncertainty that is essential to life.

Shiyam (saum) is one of the five Pillars of Islam. Saum/shiyam literally means to hold back or prevent. Saum or shiyam is divided into two laws, obligatory and sunnah (recommended). The following is a more detailed explanation: Saum which is obligatory is saum that must be done and will get a reward, then if it is not done it will get a sin. The obligatory saum is as follows: Saum whose law is sunnah is saum which if it is done gets a reward and if it is not done it does not get a sin. The sunnah saums are as follows: In carrying out this saum there are several obligatory requirements and legal requirements that must be considered according to Islamic law. Muslims are forbidden to have sex at the following times: Then the time of makruh to have sex is when the saum is devoted to Friday, without being interspersed with saum before or after it. Saum will be canceled if; Of all the cancellations of sexual intercourse, there are exceptions, namely eating, drinking and intercourse with a person who is having sex will not be invalidated when someone forgets that he is having sex. The following are people who may cancel the obligatory saum (saum Ramadhan): The fasting month of Ramadan that is obligatory on every believer by Allah is worship aimed at serving Allah as stated in a surah in the Qur'an, which reads: The priority of saum according to Islamic law is that people who are married will pass through a door of heaven named Rayyan, and another priority is that Allah will keep his face away from the fires of hell, as far as 70 years of travel.",

Neutrinos have a spin of 1/2 and are therefore fermions. It has a very small mass, although recent experiments (see Super-Kamiokande) show that it is not exactly zero. Neutrinos interact only through weak and gravitational interactions, neither through strong interactions nor electromagnetic interactions. A neutrino is a subatomic particle that is very similar to an electron, but has no electrical charge and a very small mass, which might even be zero. Neutrinos are one of the most abundant particles in the universe. Because they have very little interaction with matter, however, they are incredibly difficult to detect. To detect neutrinos, very large and very sensitive detectors are required. Typically, a low-energy neutrino will travel through many light-years of normal matter before interacting with anything. Consequently, all terrestrial neutrino experiments rely on measuring the tiny fraction of neutrinos that interact in reasonably sized detectors. For example, at the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory, a 1000 ton heavy water solar-neutrino detector picks up about 1012 neutrinos every second. About 30 neutrinos per day are detected. Neutrinos are created as a result of certain types of radioactive decay or as a result of nuclear reactions such as those that occur in the Sun, in nuclear reactors, or when cosmic rays strike a group of atoms. There are three types (or \"flavors)\" of neutrinos: electron neutrinos, muon neutrinos, and tauon neutrinos (or tau neutrinos); and each type also has a corresponding antiparticle, called an antineutrino.",

Interactions involving neutrinos are mediated through the weak interaction process. Because in the weak interaction process the nuclear cross section is very small, neutrinos can pass through matter almost unhindered. For typical neutrinos generated inside the Sun (with an energy of a few MeV) it would take about a light year (~1016m) of lead to block half of the amount. Neutrinos were first postulated in December, 1930 by Wolfgang Pauli to describe the energy spectrum of beta decay, the decay of a neutron into a proton and an electron. Pauli theorized that an undetected particle was responsible for the difference between the energy and angular momentum of the particles at the beginning and end of the decay. Due to its \"ghost\" nature, the first experimental detection of neutrinos had to wait 25 years since it was first discussed. In 1956, Clyde Cowan, Frederick Reines, F. B. Harrison, H. W. Kruse, and A. D. McGuire published the article \"Detection of the Free Neutrino: a Confirmation\" in the journal Science (see neutrino experiment), a result which was awarded the 1995 Nobel Prize. is a sub-atomic particle claimed by scientists at the CERN nuclear research center, based on recent research in Geneva, that neutrinos move faster than the speed of light, so that with this finding it breaks the laws of physics that have been established for more than 100 years, Einstein with his theory of relativity once said that if one day a new particle is discovered that can exceed the speed of light, then the theory of relativity will automatically be invalidated.

These immigrants consisted of soldiers and scholars. Scholars began to spread Islamic teachings to this area at the same time. Mixed marriages between migrants from Persia and local residents also occurred. Until finally, there was a mixture of Persian and Punjabi which became the forerunner to the birth of Urdu. There is another version which reveals that during the transfer of power of Qutubuddin Aibak from Lahore to New Delhi in 1193 it also caused interaction between the rulers and local residents so that a language called Urdu appeared.

The field of optics usually describes the properties of visible, infrared and ultraviolet light; but since light is an electromagnetic wave, the same phenomena occur in X-rays, microwaves, radio waves, and other forms of electromagnetic radiation and the same phenomena as in a charged beam. Optics can generally be thought of as a subset of electromagnetism. Several optical phenomena depend on the quantum nature of light which is related to various fields from optics to quantum mechanics. In practice, most of the optical phenomena can be calculated using the electromagnetic properties of light, as described by Maxwell's equations.

This simple model is sufficient to account for some optical phenomena and ignore irrelevant and/or undetectable behavior on a system. In free space a wave travels at c = 3\u00d7108 meters/second. When entering a particular medium (dielectric or nonconducting) the waves travel with a speed v, which is characteristic of the material and is less than the speed of light itself (c). The ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum to the speed of light in a medium is the index of refraction n of a material as follows: n = \u200bc\u2044v Before quantum optics became important, its roots consisted of classical electromagnetic applications and high-frequency approaches to light. Classical optics is divided into two main branches: geometric optics and physical optics. Geometric optics, or ray optics, describes the propagation of light in terms of \"rays\". Light is deflected at the interface between two different media, and can take a curved shape in the medium where the index of refraction is a function of position. A \"ray\" in geometric optics is an abstract object, or \"instrument,\" parallel to the wavefront of the actual optical wave. Geometric optics provides rules for the propagation of these rays through an optical system, which indicate how the wavefronts will actually propagate. This is a significant optical simplification, and fails to account for many important optical effects such as diffraction and polarization. This is a good approximation, however, if the wavelength of the light is very small compared to the size of the structures it interacts with. Geometric optics can be used to describe geometric aspects of imaging, including optical aberrations.",

This led to the techniques of Gaussian optics and paraxial ray tracing, which are used for first-order optical systems, such as estimating the position and magnification of images and objects. Gaussian beam propagation is an extension of paraxial optics which provides a more accurate model of coherent radiation such as laser beams. While still using a paraxial approximation, this technique takes diffraction into account, and allows calculation of the magnification of the laser beam proportional to the distance, as well as the minimum size of the beam that can be focused. Gaussian beam propagation bridges the gap between geometrical and physical optics. Physical optics or wave optics builds on the Huygens principle and models the propagation of complex wavefronts through an optical system, including the amplitude and phase of the waves. This technique, which is usually applied numerically on a computer, can calculate the effects of diffraction, interference, polarization, and other complex effects. However, in general the approximation is still used, so it does not completely model the electromagnetic wave theory of light propagation. Such a complete model is much more computationally demanding, but can be used to solve small problems that require more accurate solving.

These fields of optical science are usually concerned with the electromagnetic or quantum properties of light but do not include other topics. Optics are part of everyday life.

Pragmatism emerges as a tradition of thought originating in the West and developing especially in America. Its presence as a thought that seeks to answer the problems of human life. Pragmatism is classified as one of the 19th century philosophical schools in the history of Western philosophy. The pioneer of pragmatism thought was a philosopher from the United States named Chales Sanders Peirce (1839\u20131914). Influential figures in pragmatist thinking include William James (1842\u20131910) and John Dewey (1859\u20131952). The idea of \u200b\u200bpragmatism was first put forward by Charles Sanders Peirce in the early 1870s at a meeting of a philosophical group called the Metaphysical Club. The meeting was held in Cambridge, Massachusetts informally. The discussion results from the meeting were written by Peirce into two articles entitled The Fixation of Belief (1877) and How to Make Our Ideas Clear (1878). Both of these articles were published in a magazine called Popular Science Monthly. The term \"pragmatism\" comes from the Greek, namely from the word pragma. This word has many meanings, including facts, objects, material, something that is made, activities, actions, results or work. From this collection of meanings, pragmatism is defined as a thought that prioritizes the function of ideas in action. On the other hand, the term \"pragmatism\" was obtained by Charles Sanders Peirce from the philosophical thoughts of Immanuel Kant. In Kant's thought there are two similar words with different meanings, namelypracticch and pragmatisch. These two words come from the Greek, namelypracticos and pragmatikos.",

Meanwhile, the term pragmatisch is defined as a movement produced by the human will to provide a definitive goal as an important stage for explaining thoughts correctly. Pragmatism becomes the logic of observation as its rationale. This view states that the reality of the world seen by humans is facts that are real, separate from one another and individual. The world is shown as is, so differences can be taken for granted. The manifestation of reality is always personal and not a public fact because it only arises from the human mind. The function of service and usability becomes a means of justifying an idea. Pragmatism does not discuss the philosophical study of truth, especially with regard to metaphysics. Pragmatism is a philosophical school that assesses the truth of a theory or belief based on its level of success or benefit in practical application. The main problem for pragmatism is about the usefulness of knowledge, not the nature of knowledge. This view is based on the idea that knowledge is a means of action. Pragmatism solves theoretical and practical problems in human life by relying on the use of reason. John Dewey is one of the most influential figures in pragmatist thought. The pragmatic thinking developed by Dewey is also known as experimentalism. This naming comes from his thinking which states that human growth is the goal of education. He calls it growth because he thinks that everything in this world is always changing. John Dewey's pragmatic thinking became one of the thoughts that influenced the start of mass education. William James (1842\u20131910) was one of the figures who studied the human way of overcoming life's problems in the form of industrialization and economic growth.",

James is an adherent of relativism which produces pragmatic thinking on the American continent. This pragmatism is defined as a practicality and usefulness so that the criteria of truth are given to everything that can make everything workable. James believes that it is humans who create the truth so that the truth resides within humans. This pragmatism truth criterion has an impact on the world of business and politics in America. Pragmatism thinking makes socialism not develop in America. Max Scheler criticized pragmatism in his work entitled Erkenntnis und Arbeit. This book was first published in 1926. In Scheler's view, pragmatism failed to think about the deep relationships between human individuals and other individuals. This is marked by the absence of studies on the transcendence of love. He argues that pragmatism is only a method of thinking that focuses entirely on the desire to dominate nature. Pragmatism is an important thought for vocational education. In pragmatism, something is considered important based on the level of its usefulness. The main question in pragmatism is about \"for what\" and not about \"what\". Pragmatism is concerned with the practical consequences of an action. In vocational education, pragmatism divides between theory and practice. In theory development, pragmatism provides the foundation for normative ethics. While in practical development, pragmatism fulfills human needs through vocational education which produces a professional workforce. The existence of a balance between theory and practice makes pragmatism prevent education from practical goals that are only materialism. Pragmatism also prevents education from losing its function as a means of meeting the needs of society. Pragmatism is a school of educational philosophy that underlies the development of another school of educational philosophy, namely progressivism.",

Thinking about deconstruction does not accept a text constantly according to the meaning of the text. Deconstruction thinking believes that a text must have hidden meanings and have different meanings. Therefore, deconstruction thinking requires a process of searching for meaning structurally from a single meaning that has been generally agreed upon by readers. In writing historical texts, researchers do not find all historical sources directly and completely. Meanwhile, the theory and methodology of historical writing continues to develop. Therefore the writing of history is often done again. So the deconstruction method in writing history is usually used, in order to achieve a truth that can be accounted for. Meanwhile, in the research of literary works, deconstruction is a type of literary criticism that distorts a meaning so that it becomes paradoxical. This is intended to know the overall content of the literary work in depth. The idea of \u200b\u200bdeconstruction was pioneered by Jacques Derrida. Deconstruction thinking is the key to postmodern thinking. Derrida considers that scientific theory develops rigidly, so that it cannot be refuted. Derrida's thinking assumes that a science can be reviewed, its truth is not absolute, and its truth must be proven. Deconstruction is an approach to thinking developed by postmodernism. Deconstruction thinking uses social theory to understand history. For deconstruction thinkers, historical writings are equated with language works. This thought was born from a philosopher named Derrida. He developed his thoughts first in France, then continued to develop to the United States.",

The scale of nature extends from subatomic to cosmic. The study of nature is a large part of science. Although humans are part of nature, human activities are often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena. The word nature is a translation of the English \"nature\", which comes from the Latin natura, or \"essential quality, innate disposition\", and in ancient times, literally means \"birth\". Natura is the Latin translation of the Greek word physis (\u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2), which originally related to the innate characteristics that plants, animals, and various other features of the world have. The concept of nature as a whole, or the physical universe, is an extension of the original concept; it began with the application of the Greek word physis (\u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2) by pre-Socratic philosophers, and has continued to grow ever since. This word was also used a lot during the emergence of the modern scientific method in the last few centuries. In the various uses of the word today, \"nature\" often refers to geology and wildlife.

Depending on the particular context, the term \"natural\" can also be distinguished from the unnatural, the supernatural, or the synthetic. Earth is the only planet known today that can support life, and its natural features are the subject of many areas of scientific research. In the Solar System, it is the third closest planet to the Sun, the largest terrestrial planet and the fifth largest planet overall. The most prominent climatic features are two large polar regions, two narrow temperate zones, and a wide equatorial tropical to sub-tropical region. Rainfall varies greatly with location, from a few meters of water per year to less than a millimeter. 71% of the earth's surface is covered by oceans of salt water. The remainder consists of continents and islands, with most of the inhabited land in the Northern Hemisphere. Earth has evolved through geological and biological processes that have left traces of the original conditions. The outer surface is divided into several tectonic plates which migrate gradually. The interior remains active, with a thick layer of plastic mantle and a core full of iron that generates a magnetic field. Life has altered the state of Earth's atmosphere, which creates an ecological balance that stabilizes surface conditions. Although there are regional variations in climate due to latitude and other geographic factors, the long-term average global climate is quite stable during interglacial periods, and variations of a degree or two in mean global temperature have historically had a large effect on the ecological balance, and on environmental conditions. actual geography of the Earth.",

The field of geology includes the study of the composition, structure, physical properties, dynamics, and history of the materials that make up Earth, and the processes by which these materials form, move, and change. This field is a major scientific discipline, and is also important for mineral and hydrocarbon mining, knowledge of and mitigation of natural disasters, some fields of geotechnical engineering, and understanding past climates and environments. The geology of an area evolves over time as rock units are deposited and embedded, and deformational processes change their shape and location. The rock units are placed either by deposition onto the surface or intrusion into the overlying rock. Deposition can occur when sediments settle to the surface of the earth and then lithify into sedimentary rock, or when volcanic materials such as volcanic ash and lava flows blanket the surface. Intrusive igneous rocks such as batholiths and laccoliths push overlying rocks, and crystallize when they intrude. After the initial sequence of rocks has been deposited, the rock units can undergo deformation and/or metamorphosis. Deformation usually occurs as a result of horizontal shortening, horizontal extension, or side-to-side movement (strike-slip). These structural modes are generally related to convergent boundaries, divergent boundaries, and changing boundaries, respectively, between plate tectonics. Earth is thought to have formed 4.54 billion years ago from the solar nebula, along with the Sun and other planets. The moon formed about 20 million years later. Originally liquid, Earth's outer layers cooled and formed a solid crust. Gas eruptions and volcanic activity produced the primordial atmosphere.

Continents formed, then scattered and reformed as the Earth's surface went through a process of formation over hundreds of millions of years, sometimes several of them coming together to form a supercontinent. About 750 million years ago, the earliest known supercontinent Rodinia began to break apart. The continents then regrouped to form Pannotia which broke up about 540 million years ago, and finally Pangea which broke apart about 180 million years ago. There is significant evidence that glacial activity during the Neoproterozoic era resulted in large parts of the planet being covered in ice. This hypothesis is referred to as the \"Snowball Earth\" and is interesting because it predates the Cambrian eruption, which was the event when multicellular life forms began to proliferate about 530-540 million years ago. Since the Cambrian explosion there have been at least five mass extinctions. The last mass extinction occurred about 65 million years ago, when a meteorite impact likely triggered the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs and other large reptiles, but not the small animals such as mammals, which later resembled shrews. Over the last 65 million years, mammalian life has diversified. Several million years ago, a species of small African ape managed to acquire the ability to stand upright. Then came human life and the further development of agriculture and civilization allowed humans to impact the Earth more quickly than any previous form of life.

The outbreak of extinction events is currently being researched, debated and accounted for by biologists. Earth's atmosphere plays an important role in maintaining the planet's ecosystem. The thin layer of gas that surrounds the Earth is held back by the planet's gravity. Dry air is composed of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, 1% argon and other inert gases, carbon dioxide, etc., but air also contains a variable amount of water vapor. Atmospheric pressure decreases with altitude, and has a scaled height of about 8 kilometers at the Earth's surface: the height at which atmospheric pressure has decreased by a factor of e (a mathematical constant equal to 2.71 ...). The ozone layer in Earth's atmosphere plays an important role in filtering out the amount of ultraviolet (UV) radiation that reaches the surface. Because DNA is easily damaged by UV rays, the ozone layer serves to protect life on the surface. The atmosphere also retains heat during the night, thereby reducing daily temperature extremes. Terrestrial weather occurs almost exclusively in the lower atmosphere, and functions as a convective system for distributing heat. Ocean currents are another important factor in determining climate, in particular the underwater thermohaline circulation which distributes heat energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions. These currents help to moderate the temperature difference between winter and summer in the temperate zone. Also, without the redistribution of heat energy by oceanic and atmospheric currents, the tropics would be much hotter, and the polar regions much colder.",

Surface vegetation has evolved to depend on seasonal variations in the weather, and sudden changes lasting only a few years can have dramatic effects on both the plants and animals that depend on growth for their food. The planet's climate is a parameter of long-term trends in weather. Various factors are known to influence climate, including ocean currents, surface albedo, greenhouse gases, variations in sunlight, and changes in the planet's orbit. Based on historical records, Earth is known to have experienced drastic climate changes in the past, including ice ages. Several factors (especially latitude) affect the climate in an area. Latitudes with the same climatic attributes form climatic regions. There are a number of such areas, ranging from tropical climates at the equator to arctic climates in the far north and south. Weather is also affected by the seasons, which result from the Earth's axis being tilted relative to its orbital plane. So, at any given time during the summer or winter, one part of the planet is exposed to more direct sunlight. This exposure to the sun occurs alternately as long as the Earth rotates in its orbit. At any given time, regardless of the season, the northern and southern hemispheres experience opposite seasons. Weather is a chaotic system that can be modified by small changes in the environment, so accurate forecasts are currently limited to a few days.

Water covers 71% of the earth's surface. On Earth, water is found mostly in the oceans and large bodies of water, with 1.6% of the water underground in aquifers and 0.001% in the air as vapor, clouds (formed from solid and liquid water particles suspended in the air), and rainfall. Ninety-seven percent of the water on the surface is in the oceans, meanwhile in glaciers and polar ice caps there are as much as 2.4%, and other surface water such as rivers, lakes and ponds 0.6%. In addition, some of the earth's water is also contained in biological bodies and various products. Oceans or seas are the largest collection of salt water and the main component of the hydrosphere. About 71% of the earth's surface (an area of \u200b\u200babout 361 million square kilometers) is covered by oceans, which are a continuous body of water that is commonly divided into several main oceans and smaller seas.

Areas smaller than oceans are called seas, bays, and other names. There are also salt lakes, which are smaller collections of land salt water that are not connected to the World Ocean. Two notable examples of salt lakes are the Aral Sea and the Great Salt Lake. Lakes are a collection of liquids on the surface of the Earth that collect at the bottom of a basin and flow slowly when they do flow. On land, a body of water is considered a lake when it is inland, not part of an ocean, is larger and deeper than a pond, and is fed by a river. The world other than Earth known to have lakes is Titan, Saturn's largest moon, which has lakes of ethane, most likely mixed with methane. It is not known whether Titan's lakes are fed by rivers, although Titan's surface has many river channels. Natural lakes on Earth are commonly found in mountainous areas, rift zones, and areas with ongoing or recent glaciation. Other lakes are found in endorheic basins or along older river channels. In some parts of the world, there are many lakes due to chaotic drainage patterns during the last Ice Age. All lakes are transient on the geological time scale as they will slowly fill with sediment or spill out of the basin. A pond is a stagnant body of water, either natural or man-made, that is usually smaller than a lake.

A river is a natural body of water, usually fresh water, that flows into an ocean, lake, sea or other river. In some cases, a river flows into the ground or dries up completely before reaching another body of water. While small rivers may also be referred to by other names, including stream, stream, gullet, tributary, and rill, there is no general rule that defines what can be called a river. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; one example is Burn in Scotland and North East England. Sometimes a river is said to be larger than a creek, but this is not always the case, due to ambiguity in the language. A river is part of the hydrologic cycle. Water in rivers is generally collected from precipitation through surface runoff, groundwater recharge, springs, and the release of stored water in natural ice and snowpacks (i.e., from glaciers). In the United States a stream is classified as a small river less than 60 feet (18 meters) wide. Streams are important as conduits in the water cycle, instruments for groundwater recharge, and pathways for fish and wildlife migration. The biological habitat in the area around the river flow is called the riparian zone.

Variation of these factors will initiate dynamic changes to the ecosystem. Some of the more important components are: soil, atmosphere, solar radiation, water, and living organisms. The main idea in the ecosystem concept is that living organisms interact with every other element in their local environment. Eugene Odum, founder of the concept of ecology, stated: \"Any unit that includes all the organisms (i.e.: a \"community\") in a given area that interact with the physical environment so that the flow of energy leads to trophic structure, biotic diversity, and material cycles (i.e. the exchange of materials between living and non-living parts) in a system constitutes an ecosystem.\" In ecosystems, species are connected and dependent on each other in the food chain and in the energy-material exchange between themselves and with their environment. The human ecosystem concept is based on the deconstruction of the human/nature dichotomy and the premise that all species are ecologically integrated with each other, as well as with the abiotic constituents of their biotopes. A smaller unit of an ecosystem is called a micro-ecosystem. For example, a micro-ecosystem could be a rock and all the life beneath it. A macro-ecosystem can involve an entire ecoregion with its watershed. Wildlife is generally defined as areas that have not been significantly modified by human activity.

Some authors believe that wilderness areas are essential to the human spirit and creativity, and some ecologists consider wilderness areas to be an integral part of the planet's self-sustaining natural ecosystems (biosphere). The wild can also protect the genetic traits they provide habitat for wild flora and fauna that might be difficult to reproduce in a zoo, arboretum or laboratory. Although there is no consensus on the definition of life, scientists generally accept that the features of life are organization, metabolism, growth, adaptation, response to stimuli and reproduction. Life can also be said to be merely a characteristic of organisms. A property common to terrestrial organisms (plants, animals, fungi, protists, archaea and bacteria) is that they are composed of cells, are carbon and water based with complex organization, possess metabolism, capacity to grow, respond to stimuli, and reproduce. An entity with this property is generally considered to be alive. However, not all definitions of life consider all of these traits to be important. An analogue of man-made life can also be considered as having life. The biosphere is the outermost part of the Earth - including land, surface rock, water, air and atmosphere - where life exists. From the broadest geophysical perspective, the biosphere is a global ecological system that integrates all living things and their relationships, including their interactions with the elements of the lithosphere (rock), hydrosphere (water), and atmosphere (air).

Life is only known to exist on planet Earth. The origin of life is still a poorly understood process, but it is thought to have occurred some 3.9 to 3.5 billion years ago during the Hadean or Archean periods at a time when the primordial Earth had a substantially different environment from that found today. Life forms have basic properties of self-replicating and inherited traits. After life arose, the process of evolution by natural selection resulted in the development of more diverse life forms. Species that cannot adapt to environmental changes and competition with other living things have become extinct. However, the fossil record retains evidence of many older species. Recent fossil and DNA evidence show that all existing species can trace their ancestry back to the first primitive forms of life. The emergence of photosynthesis in a form that is so basic to plant life around the world allowed solar energy to be harvested to create the conditions that allowed life to become more complex. The resulting oxygen accumulates in the atmosphere and gives rise to the ozone layer.

The combination of their high mutation rate and horizontal gene transfer ability makes them adaptable and able to survive in new environments, including outer space.

Originally Aristotle divided all living things between plants, which generally don't move fast enough for humans to see them, and animals. In Linnaean's system it became the two kingdoms Vegetabilia (later Plantae) and Animalia. Since then, it is clear that the Plantae as originally defined included several unrelated groups, and several unrelated groups of fungi and algae were transferred to populate the new kingdom. However, they are still often considered plants in many contexts. Bacterial life is sometimes included in flora, and some classifications use the term bacterial flora separate from plant flora. One way to classify plants is by area which (depending on the purpose of the study) may also include plant fossils, or the remains of plant life from earlier eras.

This is an example of how human interaction with nature can blur the boundaries of what is considered part of nature. The former category of weeds is also used for plants.

Animals as a category have several characteristics that generally set them apart from other living things. Animals are eukaryotic and usually multicellular which differentiates them from bacteria, archaea and protists. They are heterotrophs and generally digest food in an internal chamber, which differentiates them from plants and algae. They are also distinguished from plants, algae, and fungi by the lack of cell walls. With a few exceptions, notably sponges (phylum Porifera), animals have bodies that are differentiated into separate tissues. This includes the muscles, which are capable of contracting and controlling motion, and the nervous system, which sends and processes signals. Usually there is also an internal digestive chamber. Eukaryotic cells shared by all animals are surrounded by a distinctive extracellular matrix consisting of collagen and elastic glycoproteins.

Examples of threats to nature created by humans are pollution, deforestation, and disasters such as oil spills. Humans have contributed to the extinction of many plants and animals. Humans use nature for pleasure and economic activity. Acquisition of natural resources for industrial use remains a major component of the world economic system. Some activities, such as hunting and fishing, are undertaken for both food and recreation, often by different people. Agriculture was first implemented around the 9th millennium BC. From food production to energy, nature influences economic wealth.

Nature has been described and celebrated by so much art, photography, poetry and other literature that many people associate nature with beauty. The reasons why these associations exist, and what these associations consist of, are studied by the branch of philosophy called aesthetics. Apart from certain basic characteristics that many philosophers agree on to explain what is seen as beauty, the opinions that exist are endless. Nature and wildness have been important subjects in various eras of world history. An early tradition of landscape art began in China during the Tang dynasty (618-907). The tradition of representing nature as it really is was one of the goals of Chinese painting and was a significant influence on Asian art. Although the wonders of nature were celebrated in the Psalms and Job, the depiction of wilderness in art was heavily practiced in the 1800s, especially in the work of the Romantic movement. British artists John Constable and J. M. W. Turner focused on depicting natural beauty. Previously, paintings usually had religious or humanist themes. William Wordsworth's poetry describes natural wonders, previously seen as threatening places. Furthermore, respect for nature has become an important aspect of Western culture. Some fields of science view nature as a moving object, which also follows certain rules. These rules then try to understand by scientists. So the most basic science is referred to as \"physics\" \u2013 the name used until recently to refer to the study of nature. Matter is generally defined as a substance composed of physical objects.

Minimization of production costs is achieved by reducing workers' wages. Capitalism is carried out by an agency or individual outside the government. Thus, the government cannot intervene in the market to obtain mutual benefits, but government intervention is carried out on a large scale for personal interests. The perpetrators of capitalism are called Capital. Capitalism actually does not have a universal definition that can be widely accepted. Some experts define capitalism as a system that began to apply in Europe in the 16th to 19th centuries, namely during the development of European commercial banking where a group of individuals or groups could act as a certain entity that could own or trade in property. personal assets, especially capital goods, such as land and people for the process of changing from capital goods to finished goods. To obtain these capitals, capitalists must obtain raw materials and machinery first, then laborers who act as machine operators in order to obtain value from the raw materials processed. Capitalism has a long history, namely since the discovery of a trading system carried out by the private sector. In Europe, this is known as the guild as the forerunner of capitalism. Currently, capitalism is not only seen as a way of life that wants profit. The merging of capitalism with socialism without any modifications makes capitalism more malleable than it was two or three centuries ago.

Governments dominated trade for centuries, which created economic inequality. These thinkers began to think that the bourgeoisie, which in the previous era began to play an important role in the state-dominated trade economy or better known as mercantilism, should start trading and production to support the pattern of people's lives. Some of these experts include: Adam Smith is a classical capitalist economic figure who criticized the mercantilism system which he considered less supportive of the people's economy. He criticizes the psyocrats who think land is the most important thing in the pattern of production. The production movement must move according to the concept of MCM (Capital-Commodity-Money), which is something that will not stop because money will turn into capital again and will rotate again when invested. Adam Smith views that there is a hidden power that will regulate the market (invisible hand), so the market must have laissez-faire or freedom from government intervention. The government only serves as a supervisor of all the work done by its people. Critics of capitalism associate it with social inequality and the unequal distribution of wealth and power; tendencies to market monopoly or oligopoly (and government by oligarchs), imperialism, counter-revolutionary wars and various forms of economic and cultural exploitation; materialism, repression of workers and trade unionists, social alienation, economic inequality, unemployment, and economic instability.",

Marxists had advocated a revolutionary overthrow of capitalism that would lead to socialism, before finally changing to communism. Many socialists consider capitalism to be irrational, in that production and economic direction are not planned, creating many inconsistencies and internal contradictions. Labor historians and scholars such as Immanuel Wallerstein argue that non-free labor -by slaves, indentured servants, prisoners, and other people forced upon - is compatible with capitalist relations. Marxist economist Richard D. Wolff postulated that capitalist economies prioritize profit and capital accumulation over the social needs of society, and capitalist companies rarely ever include workers in basic corporate decisions. Many aspects of capitalism have come under attack from the anti-globalization movement, which is particularly opposed to corporate capitalism. Environmentalists argue that capitalism requires continued economic growth, and that it will inevitably deplete Earth's limited natural resources. Such critics argue that while this neoliberalism, or contemporary capitalism, does increase global trade, it also allows for increased global poverty - with more people living in poverty than before neoliberalism, and environmental indicators showing massive environmental damage since the late 1970s .

In contrast to the phyla Cnidaria and Platyhelminthes (flatworms), nematodes have a tubular digestive system with openings at both ends. Nematode species can be difficult to distinguish from one another. For this reason, estimates of the number of nematode species vary among scientists and can change rapidly. A 2013 animal biodiversity survey published in the journal Zootaxa put this figure at over 25,000. Estimates of the total number of surviving species have greater variation. A widely referenced article published in 1993 estimates there are over 1 million nematode species. A subsequent publication challenged this claim on the grounds that it was not supported by facts, and put the figure at only 40,000 species. Estimates supported by species richness grading curves, together with the use of DNA barcoding, and the increasing recognition of widely distributed cryptic species among nematodes, have put the figure closer to 1 million species. Nematodes have successfully adapted to almost every ecosystem, from marine (saltwater) to fresh water, on land, and from the polar regions to the tropics, as well as from the highest to the lowest altitudes.

The average life expectancy of people with the disorder is 12 to 15 years shorter than those without it, which is a result of increasing health problems and higher suicide rates (about 5%). A person diagnosed with schizophrenia may experience hallucinations (most report hearing voices), delusions (usually strange or unusual), and disturbances in thought and speech. The latter can be in the form of losing the order of thought, to sentences whose meanings are not related, to incoherence which is known as messy words in more severe cases. Social withdrawal, messy and unhygienic clothing, and loss of motivation and judgment are common in schizophrenia. There is usually an observable pattern of emotional distress, for example an unresponsiveness. Disturbances in social cognition are associated with schizophrenia, as are symptoms of paranoia; Social isolation generally arises.

To suppress the developmental disorders associated with schizophrenia, many studies have been carried out to identify and treat the prodromal (pre-start) phase of the disease, which can be detected up to 30 months before symptoms appear. Those who have experienced the development of schizophrenia experience transient or self-limiting psychotic symptoms and nonspecific symptoms of withdrawal from surroundings, irritability, dysphoria, and clumsiness during the prodromal phase. In the early 20th century, a psychiatrist named Kurt Schneider listed the psychotic symptoms that he thought distinguished schizophrenia from other psychotic disorders. This list is called first-rank symptoms or Schneider's first-rank symptoms. These symptoms include the delusion of being in the control of an external force; the belief that thoughts enter or leave the subconscious; the belief that one's thoughts are radiated to another person; and hearing a hallucinatory voice commenting on a person's thoughts or attitudes or conversing in a hallucinatory voice. Although it contributes to the diagnostic criteria significantly, the specificity of the first-order symptom is still questionable. A review of diagnostic studies conducted between 1970 and 2005 found that they neither confirmed nor denied Schneider's claims, and suggested that first-degree symptoms should not be emphasized in future diagnostic systems. Schizophrenia is generally described as positive and negative (or deficit) symptoms. Positive symptoms are symptoms that are not experienced by most individuals normally but are experienced by a person with schizophrenia.

Research shows that negative symptoms contribute to poor quality of life, functional limitations, and burdens on others compared to positive symptoms. Patients with prominent negative symptoms often have a history of maladjustment prior to the onset of the disease, and response to treatment is usually limited.

It appears that many genes are involved, every bit continguous to the effect and transmission and expression of which is unknown. Many causes have been proposed, including specific ones such as copy number variation, NOTCH4, and histone protein loci. A number of things related to the genome such as the zinc finger protein 804A have also been linked. There is significant overlap in the genetics of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.

Cannabis may play a causal role, but other drugs can be used only as a way to treat depression, anxiety, boredom, and loneliness. Dependence on the use of high doses of cannabis is at risk of developing psychotic disorders whose frequent use is correlated with a twofold increased risk of psychosis and schizophrenia. Although cannabis use is accepted as a contributing cause of schizophrenia by many, it remains controversial.

This difference is about 5 to 8%. Several attempts have been made to explain the relationship between altered brain function and schizophrenia. One of the most common theories is the dopamine hypothesis, which explains that psychosis is due to the mind's misinterpretation of the discharge of dopaminergic neurons. Many psychological mechanisms are involved in the growth and development of schizophrenia. Cognitive biases have been identified in people who are diagnosed with or at risk of developing schizophrenia, especially when under stressful or confusing situations. Some cognitive features may reflect global neurocognitive deficits such as memory loss, while others may relate to specific problems or experiences. Despite the apparent appearance of emotional blunting, recent studies have shown that many individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia are emotionally responsive, particularly to stressful or negative stimuli, and that this sensitivity can lead to susceptibility to both the symptoms and the disorder. Some evidence suggests that the content of psychotic delusions and experiences may reflect the emotional causes of the disorder, and how a person interprets these experiences can influence symptomatology. The use of \"safe behavior\" to avoid imaginative threats can contribute to chronic delusions. Further evidence of the role of psychological mechanisms comes from the effects of psychotherapy on schizophrenic symptoms.

Reduced brain volumes, smaller than those seen in Alzheimer's disease, have been reported in areas of the frontal cortex and temporal lobe. It is not clear whether these volumetric changes are progressive or preexist with the disease. This difference is associated with the neurocognitive deficits often associated with schizophrenia. Because the neural circuits change, alternatively it has been suggested that schizophrenia should be considered as a combination of neurodevelopmental disorders. Particular attention has been paid to the function of dopamine in the brain's mesolimbic pathways. It focuses largely on the accidental discovery that phenothiazines, which block dopamine function, can reduce psychotic symptoms. This is also corroborated by the fact that amphetamine, which triggers the release of dopamine, can amplify psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia. The high-impact dopamine hypothesis in schizophrenia was put forward in that overactivation of D2 receptors is the cause (positive symptoms of) schizophrenia. Although postulated for about 20 years based on the D2 inhibitory effect common to all antipsychotic drugs, it was not until the mid-1990s that PET and SPET imaging studies provided supporting evidence. The dopamine hypothesis is now considered an oversimplification, in part because newer antipsychotic medications (atypical antipsychotic medications) can be just as effective as older medications (typical antipsychotic medications), but also affect serotonin function and may have a slightly less inhibitory effect on dopamine. Concern has also focused on the neurotransmitter glutamate and reduced NMDA glutamate receptor function in schizophrenia, largely because of the abnormally low levels of glutamate receptors found in the postmortem brains of people diagnosed with schizophrenia, and the discovery of glutamate-blocking drugs such as phencyclidine. and ketamine may mimic the symptoms and cognitive problems associated with the condition.",

The ICD-10 criteria emphasize first-order Schneiderian symptoms. In practice, the agreement between the two systems is high.

The DSM-IV-TR contains five subclassifications of schizophrenia, although the developers of the DSM-5 recommended that this subclassification be omitted from the new classification: The ICD-10 criteria provide for two additional subtypes: Psychotic symptoms may be present in several other mental disorders, including bipolar disorder, borderline personality, drug intoxication and drug-induced psychosis. Delusions (\"non-bizarre\"/not strange) are also found in delusional disorder, and social withdrawal in social anxiety disorder, avoidant anxiety disorder and schizotypic personality disorder. Schizophrenia is frequently coexisted with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and is significant in comparison to that which could occur purely by chance, although it is difficult to distinguish between the obsessions that occur in OCD and the delusions of schizophrenia. Further general physical and neurological examinations are needed to rule out diseases that can sometimes cause schizophrenia-like psychotic symptoms, such as metabolic disorders, systemic infections, syphilis, HIV infection, epilepsy, and brain lesions. It is necessary to exclude the possibility of delirium, which can be distinguished by visual hallucinations, acute onset, and fluctuating level of consciousness, and indicates an underlying medical illness.

One approach seeks to understand what happens at the genetic and neurological level that can cause disease, so that biomedical interventions can be developed. However, the multiple and varied genetic effects, each on a small scale, that interact with the environment, make this difficult. Alternatively, public health strategies could selectively address socioeconomic factors that are associated with a higher incidence of schizophrenia in some groups, such as immigration, ethnicity, or poverty.

About three-quarters of people with schizophrenia have persistent disability with relapses. Some people recover completely and others are able to function well in society. Most people with schizophrenia live independently with community support. In people with a first episode of psychosis, good long-term outcomes were found in 42%, moderate outcomes in 35%, and poor outcomes in 27%. Recovery outcomes for schizophrenia appear to be better in developing than in developed countries. However, this conclusion is questionable. The suicide rate associated with schizophrenia is higher than average. This figure was stated to be 10%, but a recent analysis of various studies and statistics revised this estimate to 4.9%, most commonly occurring during the period following the onset or first hospitalization. Several times (20 to 40%) attempt suicide at least once. There are various risk factors, including male sex, depression, and high IQ (intelligence quotient). A strong link between schizophrenia and smoking has been shown in studies around the world. Cigarette use is particularly high among individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia, with an estimated 80% to 90% of sufferers being regular smokers, compared to 20% of the general population. Those who smoke tend to be heavy smokers, plus they consume cigarettes with high nicotine content. Some evidence suggests that paranoid schizophrenia may have better prospects than other types of schizophrenia for living independently and carrying out work functions.",

Early childhood attacks are rare, as are early attacks in middle and old age. Although it is known that schizophrenia presents at similar rates worldwide, its prevalence varies across the world, within countries, and at the local and regional level. This accounts for approximately 1% of years of life with disability adjustment worldwide. Rates of schizophrenia vary up to three times depending on how the disease is defined. Historical records of schizophrenia-like syndromes are rare before the 19th century, although reports of irrational, incomprehensible or uncontrolled behavior are common. A detailed case report in 1797 of James Tilly Matthews, and notes by Phillipe Pinel published in 1809, are often considered to be the earliest cases of this disease in the medical and psychiatric literature. Schizophrenia was first described as a distinct syndrome affecting adolescents and young adults by B\u00e9n\u00e9dict Morel in 1853, which he called d\u00e9mence pr\u00e9coce (literally 'early dementia'). The term dementia preecox was used in 1891 by Arnold Pick in a case report of a psychotic disorder. In 1893 Emil Kraepelin introduced a widely new distinction in the classification of mental disorders between dementia preecox and mood disorders (which are called manic depressions and include unipolar and bipolar depressions).",

The word schizophrenia which translates roughly as \u201csplitting of the mind\u201d and comes from the Greek roots schizein (\u03c3\u03c7\u03af\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd, \"split\") and phr\u0113n, phren- (\u03c6\u03c1\u03ae\u03bd, \u03c6\u03c1\u03b5\u03bd-, \"mind\")\u2014popularized by Eugen Bleuler in 1908 and intended to describe the separation of functions between personality, thinking, memory, and perception. Bleuler describes his main symptoms as the 4 As's: Flat \u201cAffectiveness,\u201d Autism, \u201cIdea Association\u201d Disorder, and Ambivalence. Bleuler realized that the disease was not dementia, as some of his patients improved rather than worsened, so he proposed the term schizophrenia for the disease. Medicine changed radically in the mid-1950s with the development and introduction of chlorpromazine. In the early 1970s, the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia generated a number of controversies that eventually resulted in the operational criteria used today. After the 1971 US-British Diagnostic Study, it became clear that schizophrenia was diagnosed far more frequently in America than in Europe. This is partly due to the looser diagnostic criteria in the US, which uses the DSM-II manual, in contrast to Europe and its ICD-9. A 1972 study by David Rosenhan's, published in the journal Science under the title \"Being sane where insane is,\" concluded that the diagnosis of schizophrenia in the US is often subjective and unreliable. These were some of the factors that led to the revision of not only the diagnosis of schizophrenia, but also the revision of the entire DSM manual, which resulted in the publication of the DSM-III in 1980. The term schizophrenia is commonly misunderstood as having a \u201csplit personality\u201d. While some people diagnosed with schizophrenia may hear voices and may experience voices as distinct personalities, schizophrenia does not involve a person changing into a distinct multiple personality.",

Dissociative identity disorder (having a \u201csplit personality\u201d) is also frequently misdiagnosed as Schizophrenia based on the loose criteria in the DSM-II. The first known misuse of the meaning of schizophrenia as \"split personality\" was in an article by the poet T. S. Eliot in 1933. In 2002, the term schizophrenia in Japan was changed from Seishin-Bunretsu-By\u014d \u7cbe\u795e\u5206\u88c2\u75c5 (split mind disease) became T\u014dg\u014d-shitch\u014d-sh\u014d \u7d71\u5408\u5931\u8abf\u75c7 (integration disorder) to reduce stigma. This new name was inspired by the biopsychosocial model; the percentage of patients diagnosed with this disease increased from 37% to 70% within 3 years. In the United States, the cost of treating schizophrenia including direct costs (outpatient care, hospitalization, drugs, and long-term care) and non-health care costs (law enforcement, reduced workplace productivity, and unemployment) is estimated at $62.7 billion in in 2002. The book and film \u201cA Beautiful Mind\u201d depicts the life story of John Forbes Nash, a Nobel Prize-winning mathematician who was diagnosed with schizophrenia. Social stigma has been identified as the main obstacle in healing patients suffering from schizophrenia. Individuals who suffer from severe mental illness including schizophrenia have a much greater risk of becoming victims of crimes that involve both violence and non-violence. On the other hand, schizophrenia is sometimes associated with higher levels of violence, although this is mainly due to higher levels of drug use. The homicide rate associated with psychosis is similar to that associated with drug abuse, and parallels the overall rate in the region. The role that schizophrenia plays in non-drug violence is controversial, but specific aspects of an individual's history or mental state may be a precipitating factor.",

However, in the past they were not considered related to the Celts by outsiders. The term 'Celtic' comes from the name of the Ancient Greeks. In written references to the Celtic people, Hecataeus of Greece in 517 BC refers to them as Keltoi. However, European historical literature before the 19th century never mentions \"Celtic\" or \"Celtic\". The mention of the present comes from archaeological findings which show the migration of Celtic people from Gaul and Belgium to the British Isles, such as Atrebates, Menapii, and Parisi, and played a role in the formation of the Celtic population. A clear feature of the Celts is that they are either spoken or descended from speakers of one of the Celtic languages.

There was a currency crisis that started in the spring of 2008, and on 6 October trading in Icelandic banks was halted while the government struggled to save the economy. A 2011 OECD assessment determined that Iceland has made progress in many areas, most notably in creating a sustainable fiscal policy and restoring the health of the financial sector; However, challenges remain in making the fishing industry more efficient and sustainable, and in improving monetary policy to tackle inflation.

The reason is that the parents prefer their child to be called by the middle name, not by the first name. This is quite common or maybe the middle name sounds better with the child's first name. Most Icelandic last names carry that of the father, but in certain cases, the mother's name is used for various reasons. Sometimes the child or the mother wants to break social ties with the father. Some feminists use this as a social statement. Some others choose it just because of a matter of taste. Either way, the convention remains the same.

This compound also serves to reduce the interfacial tension between two liquids, between gases and liquids, or between liquids and solids. Surfactants can act as detergents, wetting agents, emulsifiers, foaming agents (English: foaming agent), and dispersing agents (English: dispersants). surfactant The term surfactant (English: surfactant) is short for surface-active agent. The Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) of the United States National Library of Medicine refer to surfactants as \"pulmonary surfactants\" (English: pulmonary surfactant). In a broader sense, surfactants are surface active substances. Surfactants are usually organic compounds that are amphiphilic, meaning they have both hydrophobic (tail) and hydrophilic (head) groups. Therefore, surfactants contain both a water-insoluble (or oil-soluble) component and a water-soluble component. Surfactants will diffuse in water and be adsorbed at the interface between air and water or the interface between oil and water, when water is mixed with oil. Hydrophobic groups that are insoluble in water can break out of the aqueous phase, towards the air phase or the oil phase, while the water-soluble head groups remain in the aqueous phase. World surfactant production is estimated at around 15 Mtons/year, of which about half is soap. Other surfactants produced on a large scale are alkylbenzene sulfonate (1700 kton/year), lignin sulfonate (600 kton/year), fatty alcohol ethoxylates (700 kton/year), and alkylphenol ethoxylates (500 kton/year). In the bulk aqueous phase, surfactants form aggregates, a kind of micelles, where the hydrophobic tails form the core of the aggregate and the hydrophobic heads remain in contact with the surrounding liquid.",

    },
    {
        "paragraph": "Other types of aggregates may also form, such as spherical or cylindrical micelles, or lipid bilayers. The shape of the aggregates depends on the chemical structure of the surfactant, namely the size balance between hydrophilic heads and hydrophobic tails. A measure of this balance is the hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (KHL). Surfactants lower the surface tension of water by adsorbing at the air-liquid interface. The equation relating surface tension and surface excess is known as the Gibbs isotherm. The dynamics of surfactant adsorption is very important for practical applications such as in foaming, emulsifying or coating processes, where bubbles or droplets are generated rapidly and need to be stabilized. The adsorption dynamics depends on the diffusion coefficient of the surfactant. When an interface is formed, adsorption is limited by the diffusion of the surfactant into the interface. In some cases, there is the formation of an energy barrier for the adsorption or desorption of surfactants. If such a barrier limits the rate of adsorption, the dynamics are said to be 'kinetic limited'. The energy barrier can be caused by steric or electrostatic repulsion. The surface rheology of the surfactant coating, including the elasticity and viscosity of the coating, plays an important role in the stability of foams and emulsions. The interfacial and surface tensions can be determined by classical methods such as the pendulum drop method or the rotating drop method. Surface tension dynamics, namely surface tension as a function of time, can be obtained by means of maximum bubble pressure. The structure of the surfactant layer can be observed using ellipsometry or X-Ray reflectivity. Surface rheology can be determined by the oscillating drop method or sliding surface rheometers such as the double cone rheometer, double ring rheometer or magnetic bar rheometer. The \"tails\" of most surfactants are quite similar, consisting of a hydrocarbon chain, which is either branched, linear, or aromatic. Fluorosurfactants have a fluorocarbon chain. Siloxane surfactants have siloxane chains. Many important surfactants include polyether chains with highly polar anionic groups at the terminal.",

In contrast, polypropylene oxide, can be added to enhance the lipophilic properties of a surfactant. Some surfactant molecules have one or two tails; those with two tails are said to be double chained. In general, surfactants are classified according to the polarity of their head groups. Non-ionic surfactants have no charged groups on their heads. Ionic surfactant heads carry a positive, or negative, charge. If the charge is negative, the surfactant is said to be anionic; if the charge is positive, it is called cationic. If a surfactant contains a head with two oppositely charged groups, it is called a zwitterion. The following surfactants are commonly encountered: Anionic surfactants contain anionic functional groups at their heads, such as sulfates, sulfonates, phosphates, and carboxylates. Well-known alkyl sulfates include ammonium lauryl sulfate, sodium lauryl sulfate (sodium dodecyl sulfate, SLS, or SDS), and the related alkyl-ether sulfates, sodium laureth sulfate (sodium lauryl ether sulfate or SLES), and sodium myrate sulfate. Other anionic surfactants include: Carboxylates are the most common surfactants and consist of carboxylate salts (soaps), such as sodium stearate. More specific species include sodium lauroyl sarcosinate and carboxylate-based fluorosurfactants such as perfluorononanoate and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA or PFO). pH dependent primary, secondary, or tertiary amines; primary and secondary amines become positively charged at pH < 10: octenidine dihydrochloride. Permanently charged quaternary ammonium salts: cetrimonium bromide (CTAB), cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC), benzalkonium chloride (BAC), benzethonium chloride (BZT), dimethyldioctadecylammonium chloride and dioctadecyldimethylammonium bromide (DODAB).

Betaines such as cocamidopropyl betaine have carboxylates with ammonium. The most common biological zwitter ion surfactants have a phosphate anion with an amine or ammonium, such as the phospholipids phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, and spingomyelin. Non-ionic surfactants have hydrophilic groups that are covalently bonded to their oxygen, and are bonded to a hydrophobic parent structure. The water solubility of its oxygen groups is a result of hydrogen bonding. Hydrogen bonds decrease with increasing temperature, and so the solubility of non-ionic surfactants in water decreases with increasing temperature. Non-ionic surfactants are less sensitive to water hardness than anionic surfactants, and they also foam less strongly. There are no significant differences between the respective types of non-ionic surfactants, and the choice is primarily adjusted considering the cost of specific properties (eg, effectiveness and efficiency, toxicity, dermatological compatibility, biodegradability) or approval for use in food. Fatty acid ethoxylates are a very versatile class of surfactants. The molecule contains a pH sensitive weak anion head group and a stabilizing and temperature sensitive ethyleneoxide unit. The human body produces a variety of surfactants. Pulmonary surfactant (English: pulmonary surfactant) is produced in the lungs to facilitate breathing by increasing total lung capacity, TLC, and lung compliance. In respiratory distress syndrome or RDS surfactant replacement therapy helps patients have normal respiration by using surfactants in pharmaceutical dosage forms. One example of lung surfactant for pharmaceutical preparations is Survanta (beractant) or its generic form Beraksurf produced by Abbvie and Tekzima. Bile salts play an important role in digestion.

Skin irritation increases in the following order of surfactants: non-ionic, amphoteric, anionic, cationic. Surfactants are deposited routinely in a variety of ways on land and into water systems, either as part of related processes or as industrial and household waste. Some surfactants are known to be toxic to animals, ecosystems and humans, and can increase the diffusion of other environmental contaminants. Anionic surfactants can be found in soils as a result of sludge applications, wastewater irrigation, and remediation processes. Relatively high concentrations of surfactants together with multimetals can indicate a degree of environmental risk. At low concentrations, surfactant application is unlikely to have a significant effect on the mobility of trace metals. In the case of the Deepwater Horizon oil leak, Corexit, in unprecedented quantities, was sprayed directly into the sea at the leak and on the sea surface. The obvious theory is that surfactants insulate the oil droplets, making it easier for oil-eating microbes to digest the oil.

The roots are fibrous and form structures called coralloid roots (because of their miniature coral appearance) which contain cyanobacteria in threadlike colonies of the genus Anabaena. This root symbiosis with cyanobacteria is called cyanobionta (cyanobiont) and is mutualism because these cyanobacteria can bind free nitrogen from the air to become nitrate which is beneficial for the host plant. Stems are generally thick with starchy pith. The outer surface of the stem is characterized by a pattern of detached patches. Sometimes the stem does not emerge from the surface or only slightly emerges, forming a rounded appearance called the caudex. The leaves are arranged in a rosette around the apex of the stem; the fronds are pinnate or pinnate, although there are some exceptions.

As an old poem, its form is very much bound by a strict metrum, in setting the pattern of rhyme (rhyme) in a stanza, the number of syllables (syllables) in one line, and the number of lines in one stanza. In its development, especially in Bali, chanting also involves musical instruments so that the song/tone elements are connected in a stanza pattern. Rules of this kind are also known in other old poetic forms in Javanese literature, such as kakawin and macapat. Kidung can also be interpreted as a meter pattern. Lexically, the word \"kidung\" comes from Middle Javanese and has the equivalent of tembang or sekar, meaning 'singing' in new Javanese. The verb form of kidung in Middle Javanese becomes mangidung, 'to sing'. New Javanese also recognizes the term kidung which has more or less the same meaning as kidung in Middle Javanese, and the verb form becomes ngidung or angidung. This meaning is then often used in the use of the term \"kidung\" as a hymn of praise or religion in modern Javanese as well as Indonesian. The most obvious difference between kidung and kakawin is the use of language. Kakawin uses Old Javanese, while kidung uses Middle Javanese.

According to Bishop Hilarion (Alfeyev) of the Eastern Orthodox Church he has the same view on this matter. Contrary to how the Protestant Reformers are often characterized, the concept of the Catholic Church or the universal Church was not set aside during the Protestant Reformation. In contrast, the visible unity of the catholic church or universal church was seen by Protestant reformers as an essential doctrine of the Reformation. The magisterial reformers, such as Martin Luther, John Calvin, and Huldrych Zwingli, believed they had reformed the Roman Catholic Church, which they saw as corrupt. Each of them takes seriously the accusations of schism and innovation, they have denied these accusations and maintain that it was the Roman Catholic Church that had abandoned them. To justify their departure from the Roman Catholic Church, Protestants often put forward new arguments, arguing that there is no real visible Church with divine authority, only a spiritual, invisible, and hidden church \u2014 this idea dates back to the -Early years of the Protestant Reformation. Wherever the Magisterial Reformation, which received the support of the ruling powers, took place, the result was a reformed national Protestant church which was supposed to be part of the invisible whole church, but which some disagreed, on certain fine points of a doctrine and the practice of a doctrine, with what was then considered the normative point of reference on such matters, namely the Papacy and the central authority of the Roman Catholic Church.",

Therefore, religious unity is not a mere doctrine and identity but an invisible character, where unity is one of faith in Jesus Christ, rather than a common identity, doctrine, belief, and collaborative actions.

Historians also refer to this tribal civilization as the Indus Valley Civilization. Therefore, originally the term 'Hindu' was a geographical term and did not refer to a religion. The word Hindu was absorbed by European languages \u200b\u200bfrom the Arabic term al-Hind, and refers to the land for the people who inhabit the area around the Sindhu River. The Arabic term is derived from the Persian term Hind\u016b, which refers to all the tribes in India. In the 13th century, Hindustan emerged as an alternative name that is often mentioned India, which means \"Land of Hindus\". The term Hinduism was later used frequently in several Sanskrit texts such as the Rajatarangini of Kashmir (Hinduka, ca. 1450) and several texts of the Gaudiya Vaishnava school of the 16th to 18th centuries which were in Bengali, such as the Caitanyacaritamerta and Caitanyabhagawata. The term is used to distinguish Hinduism from Yawana or Mleccha. From the 18th century onwards, the term Hindu was used by European colonists and traders to refer to adherents of traditional Indian religions in general.

The idea of \u200b\u200b\"Hinduism\" as a \"single world religious tradition\" was popularized in the 19th century by European Indologists who referred to the \"brahmin castes\" as their information about religions in India. This refers to a tendency to emphasize literature and belief in the Vedas as the \"essence\" of Hindu religious practice in general, as well as to the relationship of today's 'Hindu doctrine' to various Vedanta schools (especially the Adwaita Vedanta). Colonialism has been a significant factor in the influence of the brahmin caste and the \"brahmanization\" of Hindu society. The customs of the Brahmins also influenced the understanding of Hinduism in the eyes of Europeans. The Brahmins preserved Hindu scriptures which were later studied by Europeans. The authority of these books has been the target of European research. The determination of the textual basis of Hinduism by European orientalists was based on the tendency to refer to written authority rather than oral authority. Brahmins and European scientists shared the perception of \"a general declination of an originally pure religion\". For Hindus, Hinduism is a traditional way of life.

Hindu traditions are also carried out in several countries with significant numbers of Indian immigrants, such as Mauritius (southern Africa) and Trinidad and Tobago (Central America). Hinduism does not have a founder and is not guided by one holy book. Nonetheless, there are beliefs that are common in various Hindu traditions. Subjects that are commonly found in various beliefs of the Hindu community\u2014but not limited to a few of these\u2014include belief in the Supreme Being (can be referred to as Iswara, Avatara, Dewata, Batara, etc.), darma (ethics/obligations), samsara (the repeated cycle of birth, life, death, and rebirth), karma (cause and effect), moksha (freedom from samsara), and various yogas (spiritual paths or practices). Hinduism is a rich belief system, encompassing beliefs that are monotheism, polytheism, panentheism, pantheism, monism, and atheism. The concept of divinity is complex and depends on the conscience of each member or on the traditions and philosophies followed. Sometimes Hinduism is said to be henotheistic (worshiping one God, while recognizing the existence of gods), but these terms are just exaggerated generalizations. The Vedanta and Nyaya schools hold that karma itself proves the existence of God. Nyaya is a school of logic, thus drawing a \"logical\" conclusion that the existence of the universe is only an \"effect\", so there must be a \"cause\" behind everything. Hinduism contains a philosophical concept called Brahman, which is often defined as the true reality, the essence of all things, or the soul of the universe which is the origin and support for all things and phenomena.",

In the era of Brahmanism, Brahman was a term attached to a power that made yadnya (ceremonies) effective, namely the spiritual power of sacred utterances recited by Vedic experts, so they were called brahmanas. Sometimes, Brahman is seen as the Absolute or Omnipotent, or the divine principle of all matter, energy, time, space, matter and things within or outside the universe. As a result of various contemplations about Brahman, He can be seen as God with attributes (Saguna-brahman), God without attributes (Nirguna-brahman), and/or God Almighty (Parabrahman), depending on the sect and sect. Hindu-dualistic schools and schools\u2014such as Dwaita and the Bhakti tradition\u2014worship God who has personality (has a function or \"divine attribute\", namely the supremacy of good human qualities such as All-merciful, All-merciful, All-protective, and so on) , so they worship him with the names of Vishnu, Shiva, Dewi, Dewata, Batara, and others, depending on their respective traditions. In the Hindu tradition in general, God who is seen as an omnipotent substance with the supremacy of human good nature\u2014rather than considered an infinite universal principle\u2014is called Iswara, Bhagawan, or Parameswara. However, there are various interpretations of Iswara, ranging from the belief that Iswara is not really there\u2014as Mimamsa teaches\u2014to the understanding that Brahman and Iswara are actually one, as taught by the Adwaita school. In many Vaishnava traditions, He is called Vishnu, while Vaishnava scriptures refer to him as Krishna, and sometimes call him Swayam Bhagawan. Meanwhile, in the Sakta school, He is called Dewi or Adiparasakti, while in the Saiwa school, He is called Shiva. The monistic Smarta teachings view that all the divine names such as Vishnu, Shiva, Ganesha, Sakti, Surya, and Skanda are actually manifestations of the One Supreme Brahman. The Adwaita Vedanta School rejects theism and dualism by asserting that in essence Brahman has no parts or attributes.",

In essence, Brahman cannot be said to have human qualities such as being protective, compassionate, caring, compassionate, and so on. According to this school, the human mind trapped in maya causes Brahman to be imagined as God with certain characteristics or attributes, which can be referred to as Iswara, Bhagawan, Vishnu, and other names. This school asserts that there is no prohibition against imagining a God with certain qualities, but that the real aim of life is to feel that the \"real thing\" in every being is in fact not different from Brahman. The Adwaita School can be said to be monism or pantheism because it believes that the universe does not merely originate from Brahman, but is \"essentially\" the same as Brahman. Atheistic doctrine dominates Hindu traditions such as the Samkhya and Mimamsa. In the Samkhyapravachanan Sutra of the Samkhya sect it is stated that the existence of God (Iswara) cannot be proven so that (God's existence) cannot be acknowledged. The Samkhya argues that an eternal God cannot be the source of a changing world. It is said that God is a metaphysical idea made for a situation. Proponents of the Mimamsa tradition, which is based on ritual and orthopractic, claim that there is insufficient evidence to prove the existence of God. This school holds that we don't need to postulate about a \"creator of the world\", just as we don't need to think about who wrote the Vedas or what God created the ceremony. Mimamsa considers that the names of God written in the Vedas do not actually refer to any form in the real world, and are only for the purposes of mantras. Based on this understanding, the mantra is actually \"the power of God\", so that God is nothing but the mere power of the mantra.",

The Taittiriya-Upanishad describes that the individual atman is covered by five layers: annamayakosa, pranamayakosa, manomayakosa, vijanamayakosa, and anandamayakosa. The terms atman and soul are sometimes used in the same context. In a sense, atman is a spark of Brahman, while the soul is the actuator of all living things. According to monistic/pantheistic Hindu theology (such as the Adwaita Vedanta school), the individual soul is not at all different from Brahman. The individual soul is called Jiwatman, while Brahman is called Paramatman. Therefore, this teaching is called non-dualism. When the individual's body disintegrates, the soul does not disintegrate. Instead, he transfers to a new body through reincarnation (samsara). The soul experiences it because it is covered by awidya or \"unconsciousness\" that it is actually the same as Paramatman. According to the Adwaita school of thought, the purpose of life is to realize that atman is actually the same as Brahman. The Upanishads state that anyone who feels that atman is the essence of each individual, he will realize equality with Brahman, thus achieving moksa (freedom or independence from the process of reincarnation/samsara). The Yoga of Rishi Patanjali\u2014as described in the Yogasutra\u2014is different from the monism described in the Adwaita philosophy. According to yoga, the highest spiritual attainment is not to realize that all the plurality in the universe is maya. The identity that is obtained when achieving the highest religious experience is not a mere atman. It is just one of the identities discovered by the individual. Breaking down the \"wall of human consciousness\" to build a \"unity\" of individual identity (jiwatman) with the soul of the universe (paramatman), is the goal of yoga practice. According to dualistic understandings such as the Dwaita school, the soul is an entity that is different from God, but has something in common.",

The deities who bear arms are understood by their followers as symbols of a single, true reality. \u2014Brandon Toropov & Luke Buckles, The Complete Idiot's Guide to World Religions. Hindu literature mentions a group of divine entities called dewa (or goddess in the feminine form, while dewata is synonymous with god), meaning \"shining one\", or can be translated as \"heavenly beings\". The gods are an integral part of Hindu culture and are represented in art (paintings, sculptures, reliefs), architecture and icons. Mythological stories regarding their existence are contained in a number of Hindu literature, especially the Hindu epics and the Puranas. The existence of many gods is believed to be a manifestation of Brahman. i] The Vedic and Upanishad libraries do not teach pantheism or polytheism, but monotheism and monism. There are many gods, but they are manifestations of various aspects of a \"true reality.\" The existence of the concepts of monism and monotheism are intertwined. In many verses, true reality is said to be immanent, while in others it is said to be transcendent. In monism, this true reality is Brahman, while the monotheistic view focuses more on the attribute forms (Saguna) of Brahman. Usually the meaning of deity is distinguished from Iswara (God Almighty), although many Hindus worship Iswara in a certain form (as if there were a different God) as istadewata (i\u1e63\u1e6da devat\u0101), that is, ideal figures (certain deities) of God. tend to be adored.",

In the Rigveda scriptures it is mentioned that there are 33 gods or gods, and the Puranas explain that some of them were the sons of Dewi Aditi and Bagawan Kasyapa, and were students of Wrehaspati. According to Hindu mythology in the Puranas, before gaining immortality through tirta amerta (drink of immortality), the gods are a class of beings who clash with asuras or giants and can die in battle. The power of the gods is different from that of the three main immortal gods\u2014Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva. Shiva and Vishnu are glorified as Mahadeva because of their fame in scriptures and worship. They both, along with Brahma, are seen as the Trimurti\u2014the three aspects of the Supreme. These three aspects symbolize the entire cycle of samsara according to Hinduism: Brahma as the creator, Vishnu as the protector or preserver, and Shiva as the destroyer. Two of the three gods, namely Vishnu and Shiva, have a large number of followers, thus forming the two main streams (Vaishnava and Saiwa) within the body of Hinduism. In his study of the Trimurti, Sir William Jones states that Hindus \"worship God in three forms: Vishnu, Shiva, Brahma ... The fundamental idea of \u200b\u200bHinduism, that metamorphosis, or transformation, is exemplified by the concept of avatara.\" Tridewi (\"Three Goddesses\") in Hinduism has an important role as Trimurti and functions as a partner for Trimurti. Brahma is the Creator, so he needs knowledge or Goddess Saraswati. Vishnu is the Protector, so he needs prosperity, which is manifested as Goddess Lakshmi (Sri). Whereas Shiva is the Destroyer, so he needs Goddess Parwati, Durga, or Kali as his strength. These goddesses are manifestations of one entity, namely Shakti. The Hindu Wiracarita and Puranas tell several stories about God's descent into the world (incarnation) in a mortal form for the sake of upholding society and leading people to reach moksha.",

Several well-known avatars are embodiments of Vishnu, including Rama (the main character of the Ramayana) and Kresna (an important figure in the Mahabharata). Karma is translated literally as action, work, deed, and can be described as \"the moral law of cause and effect\". According to the law of karma, good fortune comes from previous good actions, and bad luck comes from previous bad actions, which is an action-reaction system and forms a cycle of reincarnation. This causal phenomenon applies not only to the material world, but also to thoughts, words, actions, and actions performed at someone's command. According to the Upanishads, a soul forms sanskaras (impressions) from actions, whether physical or mental. Linga-sarira (a body that is more subtle than the physical body but grosser than the soul) is attached to these impressions, and carries them into the next life, thereby creating a separate path of life for each person. Therefore, the concept of karma\u2014which is universal, neutral, and never goes wrong\u2014is related to reincarnation, as well as one's personality, character, and family. Karma brings together the concepts of free will and fate. Because Hinduism believes that the soul cannot be destroyed, death is not seen as a scourge for life because it is a natural phenomenon. Therefore, a person who has abandoned his ambitions and desires, has no more responsibilities in the world, or is infected with a terminal illness can seek death by Prayopavesa. The cycle of action, reaction, birth, death and birth is a continuous process called samsara (reincarnation). The understanding of reincarnation and karma is a strong premise in Hindu philosophy. In the book of Bhagawadgita (II: 22) it is written: In Hindu belief, samsara provides an opportunity for humans to enjoy momentary pleasures at every birth. As long as humans indulge in enjoying these pleasures, they will be reborn.",

According to this belief, after experiencing reincarnation many times, eventually an atman will seek unity with the soul of the universe (Brahman/Paramatman). In Hinduism, the true purpose of life\u2014referred to as moksha, nirvana or meditation\u2014is understood in various meanings: the realization of the soul's union with God; realization of eternal relationship with God; the realization of the unification of all existing things; perfect self-awareness and knowledge of the true self; the attainment of perfect inner peace; and detachment from all worldly desires. Such realization liberates one from samsara and ends the cycle of rebirth. The conceptualization of moksha varies depending on the schools of Hinduism. For example, the Adwaita Vedanta school of thought holds that after attaining moksha, atman no longer recognizes himself as an individual, but realizes that Brahman is identical in all respects, including his similarity to atman. Followers of the Dwaita (dualistic) school view the individual as a part of Brahman, and upon attaining moksa, they believe they will attain immortality in the loka along with the manifestation of Iswara they choose. Therefore, it is analogous that dwaita followers hope to \"enjoy sugar\", while Adwaita followers hope to \"be sugar\". Classical Hindu philosophy recognizes four things that must be fulfilled as the goal of human life\u2014as described below\u2014which are called purusarta: Hindus fulfill their life goals by taking different paths. The path is yoga. Yoga here can be interpreted as physical, mental and spiritual discipline in order to gain peace and tranquility of mind. In other contexts and traditions, yoga can also be defined as \"efforts to control the mind so that thoughts don't go wild\", or \"efforts to unite oneself with God\".

The four main types of paths (yoga) that are often mentioned are: One can choose one or several yogas at once, according to one's inclination and understanding. Some schools of Hinduism which emphasize devotion teach that devotional service is the only practical path to attain spiritual perfection for the common people, based on the belief that the world is in the Kaliyuga (a time period in the current Yuga cycle). Practicing one yoga does not mean neglecting the others. Many schools of Hinduism teach that the various yogas naturally blend and support other yogic practices. An example is the practice of jnanayoga, which is thought to inevitably lead one to give pure compassion (the main goal of bhaktiyoga), and vice versa. One who is engaged in high-level meditation (as raja yoga emphasizes) must embody the basic principles of karmayoga, jnanayoga and bhaktiyoga, either directly or indirectly. According to the Hindu spiritual figure Swami Vivekananda, Hinduism is based on a set of spiritual guidelines discovered by different people at different times. Over the centuries, these guidelines were passed down orally in verse form so they could be memorized, until they were finally written down. Over the centuries, the rishis refined this teaching and expanded its propositions. In the period after the Vedic Period and according to contemporary Hindu beliefs, many Hindu scriptures are not meant to be interpreted literally.

The Smerti scriptures from the period 200 BC\u2013100 AD proclaim the authority of the Vedas, so that recognition of the authority of the Vedas is the main criterion for distinguishing Hinduism from heterodox schools that reject the Vedas. Most of the basic ideas and practices of Classical Hinduism are derived from the Smerti literature, which later became the basic inspiration for most Hindus. The two leading Indian epics\u2014Ramayana and Mahabharata\u2014which belong to the Smerti, were composed over a long period during the late BC and early Christian eras. The library contains mythological stories about leaders and wars in ancient India, and is interspersed with philosophy and religious teachings. The Purana literature composed at a later period contains stories about the gods, their interactions with humans, and their battles with the rakshasas.",

In the early Christian era, several schools of Hindu philosophy were formally codified, including Samkhya, Yoga, Nyaya, Vaisesika, Purwamimamsa, and Vedanta. During this period, power over India was centralized, as trade to distant lands expanded, legal procedures standardized, and literacy was eradicated. Mahayana Buddhism spread, while orthodox Brahmin culture began to be revived under the patronage of the Gupta dynasty, led by Vaishnava kings. The position of the brahmins was strengthened again and Hindu temples began to be built as dedications to Hindu gods. During the reign of the Gupta dynasty, the literary Puranas began to be written, used to spread common religious ideology among the acculturated indigenous and illiterate people. The Gupta kings protected the nascent Puranic tradition for the sake of their dynasty. This led to the emergence of Hinduism-Puranism (Puranic Hinduism), which was different from the previous Brahmanism which referred to Dharmasastra and Smerti. The Bhakti movement emerged during this period. The Bhakti movement is a fast-growing development of the devotional tradition, originating in Tamil Nadu (South India). The Nayanar of the Saiwa school (4th \u2013 10th century) and the Alwar of the Vaishnava school (3rd \u2013 9th century) spread poetry and devotional traditions to various parts of India from the 12th to the 18th century. According to P.S. Sharma, the Gupta and Harsha periods form\u2014from an intellectual point of view\u2014the most glorious period in the development of Indian philosophy, when Hindu and Buddhist philosophies flourished side by side. Carwaka, a school of atheistic materialism, appeared in North India before the 8th century. After the collapse of the Gupta and Harsha empires, power in India was decentralized. Several large empires began to stand up, with very many conquered lands.",

Folk and devotional movements began to emerge, along with the growth of] the Shaiva, Vaishnava, Bhakti, and Tantra traditions, although the division by sect occurred only during the early development of these traditions. Religious movements competed for recognition from local authorities. Buddhism lost its prestige after the 8th century and then began to fade in India. This is implied by the discontinuation of Buddhist puja rites in Indian court circles in the 8th century, when Hindu gods replaced the Buddha as royal protector. The ancient Puranic literature was composed to spread religious ideology that was common among the acculturated indigenous peoples. Along with the dadal period of the Gupta dynasty, virgin lands were collected by the brahmins, which not only guaranteed the agrarian profits from the exploitation of the lands owned by the kings, but also gave the new ruling class status. Brahmins spread across India, interacting with local people who adhere to different beliefs and ideologies. The brahmins used the Puranas to persuade the various clans to become an agrarian society, and to follow the religion and ideology of the brahmins. According to Flood, the brahmins who followed a Purana-based religion came to be known as Smarta, meaning people who worshiped according to Smerti, or Pauranika, namely followers of the Puranas. Local tribal chiefs and citizens were absorbed into the color system, in order to control the behavior of the \"new knights and sudras\".",

The interpretation of the caste system is more suitable for Puranic Hinduism than for the Sramana (Buddhist or Jaina) schools. The Purana literature includes an extensive genealogical history that can give a class a new status of warriors. Meanwhile, Buddhism describes government as a contract between the elect and the people, and Buddhist chakkavatti is a different concept from the conquering model of the Hindu warriors and Rajputs. Brahmanism based on the Dharmasastra and Smerti literature underwent a radical transformation at the hands of the compilers of the Puranas, resulting in the emergence of Puranic Hinduism, like a \"giant\" that crossed the \"religious horizon\", which then crossed all existing religions. Puranic Hinduism is a multifaceted belief system that grew and expanded by absorbing and integrating contradictory ideas and cult traditions. This religion is different from Smarta, which is its origin. The difference lies in fame, theological pluralism, sect pluralism, Tantric influence, and the emphasis on devotional service. Many local beliefs and traditions were assimilated into Puranic Hinduism. Vishnu and Shiva appear as the main gods, side by side with Sakti/Dewi. Worship of Vishnu eventually gave rise to the cults of Narayana, Jagatnata, Wenkateswara, and others. According to Nath: Several incarnations of Vishnu such as Matsya, Kurma, Waraha, and even Narasinga helped to integrate popular totem symbols and creation myths, especially those related to the wild boar, which generally permeated the mythology of [the library], while other incarnations such as Kresna and Balarama became a means of assimilation to local cults and myths centered on rural and agricultural gods. t] Rama and Krishna became central idols in the devotional tradition, which are especially expressed in the Bhagavata Purana.",

The non-dualistic Adwaita Vedanta school\u2014which was influenced by Buddhism\u2014was reformulated by Adi Shankara by systematizing the works of his predecessors. Today, due to the influence of Western Orientalism and Perennialism on Indian Neo-Vedanta and Hindu nationalism, Adwaita Wedanta has received wide acceptance in Indian culture and outside India as a paradigmatic example of Hindu spirituality. Although Islam had come to India as early as the 7th century (along with the arrival of Arab traders and the conquest of Sindhu), it became the main religion during the later period of Islamic conquest in South Asia. During this period, Buddhism faded away drastically, and many Hindus converted to Islam. Many Muslim rulers and their commanders, such as Aurangzeb and Malik Kafur, destroyed Hindu places of worship and oppressed non-Muslims; however, some Muslim rulers such as Akbar were more tolerant. Hinduism underwent major reforms due to the influence of the prominent Guru Ramanuja, as well as Guru Madhwa, and Sri Caitanya. Followers of the Bhakti movement moved away from the abstract concept of Brahman\u2014advocated by the philosopher Adi Shankara centuries earlier\u2014to a more fervent devotional tradition of the more easily imaginable idol worship, especially Krishna and Rama.

In the midst of the rule of the British Raj (British colonization of India), the Hindu Renaissance began to rise in the 19th century, which gave a big change to the understanding of Hinduism, both in India and in the West. Indology (the scientific discipline of studying Indian culture from a European perspective) was founded in the 19th century, led by scholars such as Max M\u00fcller and John Woodroffe. They brought the philosophy and literature of the Vedas, the Puranas and the Tantras to Europe. Orientalists searched for the \"substance\" of religions in India, and found them in the Vedic literature, while making the idea that \"Hinduism\" is a combination of various religious traditions and the popular image of 'mystical India'.

Hindu religiosity also played an important role in the nationalist movement. Hindu society is categorized into four classes, called colors, which are as follows: The Bhagawadgita relates color to one's obligations (swadharma), nature (swabh\u0101wa), and natural tendencies (gu\u1e47a). Based on the understanding of color according to Bhagawadgita, the Hindu spiritual figure Sri Aurobindo created the doctrine that one's work should be determined by one's natural talents and capacities. In the Manusmerti book there is a grouping of different castes. Mobility and flexibility in color refute allegations of social discrimination within the caste system, as argued by some sociologists, although some scholars disagree. Scholars debate whether the caste system is part of Hinduism which is governed by scriptures, or is it just a social custom.u] Various experts argue that the caste system was built by the British colonial regime. According to the Hindu spiritual teacher Sri Ramakrishna (1836\u20131886): Lovers of God does not belong to any particular caste... A brahmin without love of God is no longer a brahmin. And a pariah without love for God is no longer a pariah. Through bhakti (devotion to God), a lowly person can become pure and his rank increases. According to Vedanta literature, a person who is outside of the colors is called \"warnatita\".

The next stage is Grehasta, namely the stage of building a household life, carried out by getting married and fulfilling k\u0101ma (sensuous pleasures) and arta (prosperity). After getting married, the moral obligations that are carried out include: raising children, caring for parents, honoring guests and saints. After being married for a certain period of time, Hindus then go through the Wanaprasta stage, which is a period of retirement or a period of detachment from worldly activities. This stage can be carried out by handing over responsibility to offspring, so that retirees get more opportunities to carry out religious activities and visit holy places. The last stage is Sannyasa, which is the time to spend the rest of your life doing tapa brata, or trying to escape worldly ties. The release is done in order to find God, as well as to find a way to leave the mortal body peacefully, in order to achieve a condition called moksha. Hindu religious practice is usually aimed at seeking awareness of God, and sometimes seeking boons from the gods. Therefore, there are various religious practices within the body of Hinduism that are intended to help a person in their efforts to understand God in everyday life.

A quite popular Hindu spiritual practice is Yoga. Yoga is a Hindu teaching whose purpose is to train awareness for peace, health, and spiritual insight. This is done through a set of exercises and the formation of body positions to control the body and mind. Bhajans are the practice of chanting hymns. This practice takes various forms: it can be either simply mantras or kirtan, or it may be dhrupad or kriti with music based on ragas and tala based on Indian classical music. Usually, bhajans contain verses to express love for God. The term is the equivalent of bhakti meaning \"religious devotion\", implying the importance of bhajan to the devotional movement that spread from southern India across the Indian subcontinent during the Moghul period. Stories from scriptures, teachings of saints, and descriptions of gods have become the subject of bhajans. The dhrupad tradition, Sufi qawwali, and kirtan or songs in the Haridasi tradition are related to bhajans.

The term ahimsa is mentioned in the Upanishads and the Mahabharata epic. Ahimsa is the first of the five yama (pancayamabrata; five principles of self-control) in the Yogasutra of Patanjali, and is the first principle for all members of the Warnasramadarma (brahmanas, knights, waisya, and sudras) according to Manusmerti. The concept of ahimsa in Hinduism is not as strict as Buddhism and Jainism, because traces of the existence of sacrificial practices can be traced in the Vedic scriptures, for example the mantras for goat sacrifices (in the Rigveda), horse sacrifices (Aswameda, in the Yajurveda), and human sacrifices.

Judging from the geographical location of Myanmar which is located in the shipping lanes, contact has occurred between the people of Myanmar and traders, especially those from India. This contact with Indian traders led to cultural contact. This contact mainly occurred in the coastal areas of Myanmar. The traders established small kingdoms and caused the entry of Indian civilization in Myanmar as well as making the Myanmar people enter the historical era because they began to recognize the writings they learned from the Indian language, including the development of Buddhist teachings in Myanmar.

After 1937, Myanmar became a colony that was governed separately from India. Myanmar gained independence from the British in 1948. During the British colonial period there was no formation of a single identity for the Burmese population. This is because the territory of Myanmar is divided into two parts, namely the lowlands and highlands. Each region has a different system of government. In the lowlands, the administration of government was directly controlled by the British while in the highlands the administration was carried out by the local government through agreements and treaties between the British and the local population. Therefore, the highlands had relatively autonomy and the British also did not develop the economy and administration of Myanmar's government properly so that when Myanmar became independent there was no provision for the new government to become a strong and united government, but after Myanmar's independence many ethnic minorities formed the army. armed and revolted. In 1948, precisely on January 4, Myanmar won independence from the British. In fact, at the beginning of the 19th century, several forms of resistance from the people of Myanmar against the British had been shown. Myanmar after falling into the hands of the British experienced several wars and was then strengthened by world upheaval in international relations which had implications for political stability in Myanmar. Japan's victory in the 1905 Japan-Russia war. This is of course related to the perception that the strength of Asian countries has risen and is now starting to be reckoned with. With Japan's victory over Russia, of course, it gave a signal to the big countries that the power of Asian countries should not be underestimated anymore.

Of course, this was an advantage for Myanmar, which at that time was under British rule. This is also used as a basis for Myanmar to fight for its right to break away from the invaders. Apart from that internally, in 1919 a movement emerged against England by forming The General Council of Burmese Association (GCBA) to carry out non-cooperative politics with England. From here, the spirit of anti-British Myanmar nationalism flared up. Other Myanmar nationalist movements are Myochit (Nationalist Party), Sinyetha (Poor People's Party) and Do Bama Asiayone (We are the Nation of Myanmar) or the Thakin party which demands independence for the Myanmar people. After the strength within Myanmar was united and there was support from Britain and other allies, the attack on the Japanese army was carried out. The attack ended in the defeat of Japan.

In 1988, this wave of mass protests in Myanmar involved students, civil officials, workers and Buddhist monks. Protests came when Ne Win used armed soldiers for a military coup. Since the beginning, the masses of Myanmar have wanted the end of this military junta. . The State Peace and Development Council's (SPDC's) Myanmar put forward a popular demand to reform the government to become neo-liberal. This demand for reform especially applies to the economy, including last month when the Myanmar government withdrew fuel subsidies. The mass protests in Myanmar were indeed not as loud as those of liberal America. Everywhere the military regime still held social control. Asia Times notes that protest movements generally start small and spread out. In recent months, for example, small, peaceful protests have continued in the capital city of Yangon. But this public outrage can turn into a snowball effect and become a massive mass movement. One of them happened in Pakkoku. After the snowball is broken, it will slowly re-agglomerate. A few days after the Pakkoku incident, 500 monks marched peacefully again in Yangon, Myanmar. Like monks, the New York Times noted that this movement instead prayed for peace and safety after the Pakkoku incident. Movement in protest does not only occur from one side only.

The 88 Generation Student organization was founded by international poets from Myanmar Ming Ko Naing and Ko Ko Gyi. The two founded this organization after being released from 14 years in prison, and are quite popular in the eyes of the Burmese people.

However, there are also several species that use urine as a means of olfactory communication. Urine is filtered in the kidneys, carried through the ureters to the bladder, and finally excreted out of the body through the urethra. Urine consists of water with dissolved materials in the form of metabolic waste (such as urea), dissolved salts, and organic matter.

He is one of the thinkers of anthropocentrism who lived during the Classical Greek period. Socrates' philosophical thought aims to know humans by understanding the universe through theory. The main concern in Socrates' philosophical thought is the nature of human life. He changed the concern of philosophy from natural philosophy to human philosophy. The approach he uses is rationalism. He examines all fields of thought as long as his studies can use reason. Socrates begins every philosophical thought with curiosity. He then made this curiosity the beginning of wisdom. In his time, he became one of the Greek figures who no longer believed in myths. Socrates lived during the development of sophistic thought. His ability to use the dialogue method earned him the sympathy of the youth. Meanwhile, Socrates was despised by followers of the belief in God and God because he was considered corrupting the morals of the youth and rejecting the existence of a god or God that was recognized by his country. Socrates was one of the figures who introduced the term \"philosophy\" in educational institutions. Socrates used a philosophical method known as the midwifery method which became the de facto beginning of the development of the inductive method. Socrates' thoughts influenced his students namely Plato and then to Aristotle who was a student of Plato. The influence of Socrates' thoughts spread from his country, namely Athens, to the Western world. His main thoughts are about moral philosophy or ethics. Socrates was born to a father named Sophroniskos, while his mother was named Phairnarete in 470 BC. His father worked as a sculptor, while his mother was a midwife. Socrates married Xantipe.",

Socrates served as an Athenian soldier, but was only interested in philosophy and had no interest in politics. This then makes him live in poverty. Socrates' critical thinking made him arrested, imprisoned and sentenced to death. The imposition of the death penalty was the result of the accusations of the Sophists. Socrates was then executed in 399 BC by drinking poison. The charge laid against him was that he had perverted the minds of the Athenian youths. He died at the age of 70 years. Socrates provides philosophy teaching through the provision of knowledge of something that has been understood by someone. The teaching of Socratic philosophy is referred to as the midwifery method. He likens the process of philosophizing to that of a midwife helping a woman to give birth to her child. In philosophizing, he engages in dialogue. His main concern in philosophy is with what belongs to the human person. Socrates shifted the focus of philosophy from natural philosophy to human philosophy. He uses a critical method in philosophizing, especially regarding ethics. Socrates believes that a lot of knowledge and opinions from humans are pseudo, but humans use them in solving life's problems. He considers that human knowledge about life's problems is unclear and only conjectures. Socrates then examines two knowledges that are a matter of life, namely about happiness and virtue. Socrates begins the study of philosophy with a dialogue that requires agreement on the formulation of the topics being discussed. Submission of descriptions or real examples is carried out in each formulation. After the formulation was set, Socrates held a process of rebuttal which included comparison activities or asking questions. The answers given are in the form of statements that are contradictory or different from the formulations and real examples.",

Then, from the results of this induction, a general understanding is obtained that includes all useful knowledge and eliminates unnecessary knowledge. Philosophical thinking from Socrates has influenced the practice and theory of education in the Western world, especially in the field of teaching. Socrates developed teaching with the dialectical method. The function of teaching is to train individual accuracy in thinking and testing himself, as well as improving the knowledge he already knows. The Socratic method is used in education to develop students' knowledge independently and not fully influenced by the thoughts of the educator. In the 4th century BC, Socrates was one of the Greek philosophers who demanded that law enforcers prioritize justice over human judgment as law. Socrates views that law is part of a policy order that can achieve general justice objectively. The essence of the law established by Socrates is one of the thoughts that is no longer based on the will of the Gods. Laws have been established based on human power with guidelines for a just life in general. Socrates' opinion is similar to the view of sophism which believes that justice and morals are the essence of law which then becomes a way of life. Socrates' view of law then influenced Plato in thinking about law. Plato also considered law as a means to achieve justice. Socrates is one of the thinkers who considers society to be formed naturally. A society is formed by humans with characteristics that can experience progress or decline. The development of a society occurs without being able to be prevented at all. During his lifetime, Socrates had a student named Plato who became a pioneer of idealistic thinking.",

In addition, Indonesia is also the 4th most populous country in the world with a population reaching 270,203,917 people in 2020, as well as the largest Muslim country in the world, with more than 230 million adherents. Indonesia is a multiracial, multiethnic and multicultural country in the world, just like the United States of America. Indonesia borders a number of countries in Southeast Asia and Oceania. Indonesia borders on land with Malaysia on the islands of Borneo and Sebatik, with Papua New Guinea on New Guinea Island, and with Timor Leste on Timor. Countries that only share sea borders with Indonesia are Singapore, the Philippines, Australia, and the union territory of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in India. Indonesia is a unitary state with a republican form of government based on a valid constitution, namely the 1945 Constitution of the Republic of Indonesia (1945 Constitution). Also based on the 1945 Constitution, the People's Representative Council (DPR), Regional Representative Council (DPD), and the President are nominated and then elected in general elections.

The Indonesian Archipelago became an important trading area since the 7th century, namely since the founding of Srivijaya, a Hindu-Buddhist patterned kingdom based in Palembang. The Srivijaya Empire established religious and trade relations with the Chinese, Indians and also Arabs. Hinduism-Buddhism religion and culture grew, developed, and assimilated in the Indonesian archipelago in the early 4th to 13th centuries AD. After that, traders and scholars from the Arabian Peninsula brought Islamic religion and culture around the 8th to 16th centuries. At the end of the 15th century, Europeans came to the Indonesian archipelago and fought for a monopoly on the spice trade in Maluku during the Age of Exploration. After being under the Dutch colonial era, Indonesia, which was then called the Dutch East Indies, proclaimed independence at the end of World War II, on August 17, 1945 to be precise. Furthermore, Indonesia faced various challenges and serious problems, ranging from natural disasters, massive corruption practices , social conflicts, separatist movements, democratization processes, and periods of development, socio-economic-political changes and developments, as well as rapid modernization. Indonesia consists of various ethnic groups, languages \u200b\u200band religions. Based on the national family, Indonesia consists of indigenous peoples, namely Austronesians and Melanesians, where the Austronesians are the largest in number and mostly inhabit the western part of Indonesia. The Javanese and Sundanese make up the largest ethnic group with a percentage reaching 57% of the entire population of Indonesia.

The word \"Indonesia\" comes from the ancient Greek word Indus which refers to the Indus river in India and nesos which means \"island\". So, the word Indonesia means the \"Indian archipelago\", or the islands that are in the Indian territory; this refers to the similarities between the two nations (India and Indonesia). In 1850, George Windsor Earl, a British ethnologist, initially proposed the terms Indunesia and Malayunesia for the inhabitants of the \"Indian Islands or Malay Archipelago\". Earl's student, James Richardson Logan, uses the word Indonesia as a synonym for the Indian Archipelago. However, Dutch academic writing in the Dutch East Indies media did not use the word Indonesia, but the term Malay Archipelago (Maleische Archipel); Dutch East Indies (Nederlandsch Oost Indi\u00eb), or Indies (Indi\u00eb); East (de Oost); and even Insulinde (this term was introduced in 1860 in the novel Max Havelaar (1859) written by Multatuli about criticism of Dutch colonialism). From 1900, the name Indonesia became more common in academic circles outside the Netherlands, and Indonesian nationalists used it for political expression. Adolf Bastian of the University of Berlin popularized this name through the book Indonesien oder die Inseln des Malayischen Archipels, 1884\u20131894.

Fossils of ancient humans such as Homo erectus, which anthropologists also nicknamed \"Java Man\", raise suspicions that the Indonesian archipelago was inhabited between two million and 500,000 years ago. But the truth about this is much debated. From 110,000 to 12,000 years ago, the western mainland of the archipelago (roughly the western islands including present-day Sumatra, Java, and Borneo) was still fused with mainland Asia, forming Sundaland. During that period, around 74,000 thousand years ago, there was an eruption of Mount Toba which is said to be one of the biggest volcanic eruptions in history which caused climate change which is said to have almost destroyed the modern human population at that time. Humanity itself has not actually reached Sumatra yet, waves of migration from Africa have also been temporarily halted due to this eruption. Mount Toba then sank and its caldera formed a large lake with the same name. Around 60,000 years ago, the first wave of human migration which became the ancestors of the Melanesian race arrived in the plains of the archipelago. The end of the ice age at the beginning of the Holocene era (12,000 BC) caused sea level rise and the separation of the Sundaland mainland from mainland Asia, then split to form the archipelago as it is today. These incidents became the trigger for the emergence of a human diaspora. The arrival of the Austronesians from mainland Taiwan who began to arrive in the archipelago around 3500 to 2000 BC caused the Melanesians who had existed earlier there to be pushed into areas far east of the islands, although some of them assimilated/acculturated with these migrants. With the conditions of fertile volcanic soil, abundance of biodiversity, coupled with the ability to cultivate crops that humans had at that time, agricultural activities and settlements began to form and develop rapidly.",

However, the existence of Kandis left no evidence of artifacts and the evidence is very difficult for archaeologists to confirm, so that the existence of this kingdom is still often debated by historians. On the island of Java itself, the title of the oldest kingdom on the island of Java is thought to be held by Salakanagara which was founded in the 1st century AD in the area around Cianjur, West Java. This kingdom itself is thought to be the forerunner of Tarumanagara which was founded in 358 AD. The existence of Salakanagara is also still being debated among experts due to the lack of historical evidence. Based on existing historical evidence, the two oldest kingdoms that have been recognized by experts are Kutai Martapura and Tarumanagara in the 4th century AD. Kutai Martapura stands in an area that is currently included in the Province of South Kalimantan. Meanwhile, Tarumanagara stands in the western region of Java Island. From the evidence showing that the two kingdoms had a Hindu-Buddhist pattern, it can be ascertained that Hinduism and Buddhism have developed in the archipelago since at least the 4th century. Several Hindu-Buddhist patterned kingdoms were also formed after that. In Kalimantan, there were once many small Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms, namely Tanjungpura, Kuripan, Nan Sarunai, Selimbau, Negara Dipa, and Negara Daha.

Apart from the monsoon areas, there are also equatorial regions which are influenced by intertropical wind meeting areas, as well as local areas whose pattern is the opposite of the monsoon pattern. Several studies project that Indonesia will be affected by climate change. Adverse impacts include an average temperature increase of about 1\u00b0C in the middle of this century due to unreduced emissions, an increase in the frequency of droughts and food shortages (due to changes in rainfall and seasonal patterns affecting agriculture), as well as various diseases and forest fires. .

Tectonically, most of Indonesia's territory is very unstable because of its location where several tectonic plates meet, such as the Indo-Australian Plate, the Pacific Plate, and the Eurasian Plate. The country is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire so it has many volcanoes and experiences frequent earthquakes. Volcanic arcs run from Sumatra, Java, Bali and Nusa Tenggara, and then on to the Banda Islands in the Moluccas to northeastern Sulawesi. Of about 400 volcanoes, approximately 130 of them are still active. A supervolcanic eruption in around 77,000 BC that formed Lake Toba is believed to have caused a volcanic winter and lowered global temperatures for many years. The eruption of Tambora in 1815 and the eruption of Krakatoa in 1883 were also the largest recorded volcanic eruptions in history. Earthquakes with a major push that impacted Indonesia and occurred recently were the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. The Indonesian region has a high diversity of living things, so it is classified as one of 17 megadiversity countries by Conservation International. From the point of view of the biogeographic region, Indonesia is included in the Malesia region. Its flora and fauna are a mixture of typical Asian and Australasian species. Alfred Russel Wallace, a natural history expert, hypothesized a dividing line (later called Wallace's line) to distinguish organisms from Asia (Sunda Shelf) and Australia (Sahul Shelf). The biogeographical area which is the transition zone between these two shelves is called Wallacea. In addition, the Weber line and the Lydekker line are also used to determine Indonesia's biogeographical boundaries.

These issues contributed to Indonesia's low ranking (116th out of 180 countries) in the 2020 Environmental Performance Index. The report also shows that Indonesia's performance in general is below average, both in a regional and global context.

From the 1970s to the present, log production and various plantation and agricultural crops are responsible for most large amount of deforestation in Indonesia. More recently, deforestation has been driven by the palm oil industry. Although it can improve the welfare of local people, this industry can damage the ecosystem and cause social problems.

He was born during the Slavery period in Hierapolis, Phrygia (now called Pamukkale, Turkey), lived in Rome until his exile as a slave. Epictetus's thought, through the Stoic school, became a reference for many experts in the field of ethics, especially regarding moral ethics, that humans are able to limit themselves from the temptations of worldly desires, especially the lust to have everything. According to him, humans should examine their respective behavior in terms of their relationship with other parties so that it does not harm other people, but improves the welfare of others, because every other person is actually the extended human family itself, as residents of the earth as their home. Epictetus's real name is unknown, the name was a gift from Nero's ruler and adviser to the emperor in Rome, named Epaphroditus. When he was still a slave, he studied under the philosophers of Stoicism, Musonius, Rufus. For him, being present and learning from Musonius is a gift, it seems he was inspired by Musonius' words, \"A happy soul is one that always climbs towards natural objects, flows as it is, which we usually want to reject more and more.\" In 89 AD, when he gained freedom from slave status, he became a teacher of philosophy in Greece. Then he went to Nicopolis to Southwestern Greece to set up a school. His works were published by his follower Arrian under the title Insights of Epictetus for up to four books. There, Epictetus deepened his struggle with Stoic philosophy, living in limitations, having only -as his motto-, \"it is enough for me to live with earth, sky, and a robe.\" Officially, Epictetus did not write his own works, his work was recorded and published by his follower named Flavius \u200b\u200bArrian.",

His direct style (colloquial Greek; sharp and matter-of-fact) suggests that Arrian has caught the voice of Epictetus himself. Epictetus's thought is based on a person's ethical role in relation to his social world, which is contained in three stages of a practical ethical program, Oikeiosis can be understood as the nature or urge of all living things to defend themselves. According to the theory of oikeiosis, the most basic drive in all living things is to defend themselves. The survival process is related to its relation to every event, every party, and the world. Every human action must weigh the pros and cons of the event, the benefits of the parties here and there, and whether the benefits are for the world. But Epictetus invites humans, in weighing the good and bad, the most important thing is the good of all parties, as widely as possible for the good of the universe which is regulated by the Divine which appears in the natural order. Regarding human life which cannot be separated from relations with the political world of the state and society, Epictetus -as Musonius advises-, claims that a good life is one that is based on familial attitudes (familiriazation) or accuracy (oikeiosis). Oikeiosis contains two interrelated aspects, personal and social. A central feature of personal oikeiosis is the movement from the desire for \"favoured\" natural things such as health and wealth, to the view that such things are matter neutral (do not affect happiness) as compared to good, the only true good. and the only thing that truly benefits the self. The main feature of social oikeiosis is recognizing the fundamental associative character of human nature and the desire to help others as well as help oneself.",

With the same basic understanding, painting is a more complete development of drawing. Painting is an activity of processing a two-dimensional medium or the surface of a three-dimensional object to get a certain impression. The painting medium can be in any form, such as canvas, paper, board, and even film in photography can be considered as a painting medium. The tools used can also vary, with the condition that they can give a certain image to the media used. Painting is a work of art whose production process is carried out by daubing paint with a paintbrush, palette knife or other equipment, namely daubing various colors and shades of color gradations, with a certain color depth as well as a certain color composition of the color pigments in a solvent (or medium). ) and a binding gene (glue) for water diluent, a binding gene in the form of linen oil for oil paint with terpenthin diluent, on surfaces (support) such as paper, canvas, or walls. This is done by a painter; with the depth of color and the artist's taste, this definition is used especially if he is the creator of a work of painting. Historically, the art of painting is strongly associated with the image. Prehistoric relics show that since thousands of years ago, our ancestors had already started making drawings on cave walls to portray the important parts of life. A painting or drawing can be created using only simple materials such as charcoal, chalk, or other materials.

This ease allows drawing (and later painting) to develop faster than other branches of fine art such as sculpture and ceramic art. Like pictures, most paintings are made on flat surfaces such as walls, floors, paper or canvas. In modern art education in Indonesia, this characteristic is also called dwi-dimensional (two dimensions, flat dimensions). Objects that often appear in ancient works are humans, animals and other natural objects such as trees, hills, mountains, rivers and seas. The shape of the object drawn is not always similar to the original. This is called imagery and it is greatly influenced by the artist's understanding of the object. For example, the image of a bull is made with unusually large proportions of horns compared to the size of the real horns. This image is influenced by the artist's understanding that the horns are the most impressive part of a bull. Because of this, the image of one type of object varies depending on the understanding of the culture of the people in the area. At one point, there were certain people in a group of prehistoric people who spent more time drawing than looking for food. They get adept at drawing and begin to discover that certain shapes and arrangements, when arranged in such a way, look more interesting to look at than usual. They begin to find a sense of beauty in their activities and continue to do so as they become more and more proficient. They were the first artists on earth and it was at that time that drawing and painting began to become art activities.

As a result, even painting can no longer be in line with reality. Most paintings of this era were more symbolism than realism. So it is very difficult to find paintings that can be categorized as \"good\". Paintings at this time were used as propaganda and religious tools. Some religions that prohibit depictions of animals and humans encourage the development of abstractism (the \"correct\" separation of form elements from things). Starting from the city of Florence. After the defeat of the Turks, many scientists and humanists (including painters) withdrew from Byzantium to the present-day Italian peninsula.

Fine art finds its new soul in the rebirth of classical art. Science in this city is no longer seen as magic, but as a new tool to reclaim power seized by Turkey. In the end, the artistic influence in the city of Florence spread throughout Europe to Eastern Europe. A well-known figure from this period is this: The Industrial Revolution in England led to the mechanization of many things. Goods are made with a mass production system with high precision. As a result, the craftsmanship of an artist is no longer so valued as it has been replaced by machine-made refinement.

This yellowfin tuna has a habit of swimming fast and in schools with fish of the same size, sometimes mixed with other types of tuna. Its breeding season lasts during the summer. These fish prey on various types of fish, crustaceans, and also cephalopods. In the Halmahera and Sulawesi seas, yellowfin primarily prey on fish (malalugis and anchovies), shrimp and crabs; with malaguis fish (flying fish) occupying the largest portion. Yellowfin yellowfin are found throughout the world's tropical and temperate waters between latitudes 40\u00b0 north latitude and 40\u00b0 south latitude. This fish is an important fishing commodity; The FAO Yearbook of Fishery Statistics reports that between 1990 and 1995 yellowfin catches in the west-central Pacific ranged from 323,537 to 346,942 tonnes per year.",

Throughout the centuries, Afghanistan has been home to many peoples and has been the goal of numerous military campaigns, notably those of Alexander the Great, the Mauryans, the Muslim Arabs, the Mongol Empires, Britain, the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union, and the United States. Afghanistan is also the place where the Kushan, White Hun, Samanid, Safarid, Ghaznavid, Gurid, Khilji, Mughal, Hotaki, Durrani and others dynasties have risen to form great empires. The political history of the modern state of Afghanistan begins with the rule of the Hotaki and Durrani Empires in the 18th Century. In the late 19th Century, Afghanistan became a buffer state between the Russian Empire and the British Empire. After the Third Afghan War in 1919, King Amannullah tried to modernize Afghanistan, but failed to do so. Afghanistan became a peaceful country during the forty year reign of Zahir Shah.

It is estimated that 30% of Afghanistan's 7,000 schools were badly damaged during more than 2 decades of Soviet occupation, civil war, and Taliban rule. Only half of the schools reported having clean water, with less than 40% thought to have adequate sanitation. Education for boys was not a priority during the Taliban era, and girls were left out of school voluntarily. Regarding poverty, and the violence that surrounds them, a 2002 study by aid group Save the Children said Afghan children were resilient, and courageous. The study praised the strong family and environmental institutions. Up to 4 million Afghan children, possibly the largest number, are believed to have registered for classes for the school year beginning in March 2003. The overall literacy rate of the population is estimated at 36%. Many historical monuments of this country were damaged in the wars of recent years. Two famous Bamiyan Buddhas in Bamiyan Province were destroyed by the Taliban because they were considered symbols of other religions. The Afghans are known as horse riders. Famous sports like Buzkashi are famous there. Before the Taliban came to power, the city of Kabul was home to many musicians skilled in both traditional and modern Afghan music.",

This mineral has a hardness ranging from 5.0 to 5.5 on the Mohs scale and is relatively dense, with a density of 4.6 to 5.7 g/cm3. There are at least four types of monazite, depending on the relative composition of the elements within the minerals: The elements are listed in parentheses in order of relative proportions in the minerals: lanthanum is the most common rare earth element in monazite-(La), and so on. Silica (SiO2) is present in trace amounts, as well as trace amounts of uranium and thorium. Due to the alpha decay of thorium and uranium, monazite contains significant amounts of helium, which can be extracted by heating. Monazite is an important ore for thorium, lanthanum, cerium. Monazite is often found in placer deposits. India, Madagascar and South Africa have large deposits of monazite sand. Deposits in India are particularly rich in monazite. Monazite is radioactive due to the presence of thorium and, less commonly, uranium. Because of its radioactivity, monazite is used in monazite geochronology to study geological events, such as crystallization, heating or deformation of rocks containing monazite. The name monazite comes from the Greek \u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03ac\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd (solitary), via the German term monazite, as an allusion to an isolated crystal. All monazites adopt the same structure, which means that the arrangement of their atoms is very similar to that of other compounds of the M(III)PO4 type. The M(III) centers have a distorted coordination plane surrounded by eight oxides with a long M\u2013O spacing of about 2.6 \u00c5. The phosphate anion is tetrahedral, as usual. The same structural motif has been observed in lead chromate (PbCrO4).",

Von Welsbach was looking for thorium for his invention of a new lamp shirt. Monazite sand was quickly adopted as a source of thorium and became the basis of the rare earth industry. Sand monazite sand was also briefly mined in North Carolina, but shortly after, extensive deposits in southern India were discovered. Monazite from Brazil and India had dominated the industry before World War II, after which the main mining activities moved to South Africa and Bolivia. Large monazite deposits have also been found in Australia. Monazite is the only commercially significant source of lanthanide production. However, there are concerns over the removal of radioactive decay products from thorium. Bastnasite came to replace monazite in lanthanide production in the 1960s because of its much lower thorium content. There is increasing interest in using thorium for nuclear energy in the future which will bring monazite back into commercial use. Due to its high density, the mineral monazite concentrates in alluvial sands when it is removed from pegmatites by weathering processes. These conditions, called placer deposits, are often beach sand or beach fossil sands and contain other heavy minerals of commercial importance such as zircon and ilmenite. Monazite can be collected as a nearly pure concentrate using gravitational, magnetic, electrostatic separation. Monazite sand deposits are generally of monazite-(Ce) composition. Typically, lanthanides such as monazite contain about 45\u201348% cerium, 24% lanthanum, 17% neodymium, 5% praseodymium, and small amounts of samarium, gadolinium and yttrium.

Monasit Steenkampskraal which has supplied the complete range of lanthanides. The extremely low concentration of the heaviest lanthanides in monazite justifies the term \"rare earth\" for the element, with an equivalent value. The thorium content of monazite varies and can sometimes be as high as 20-30%. Monazite from certain carbonatite rocks or from Bolivian tin vein ores is essentially thorium free. However, commercial monazite sand usually contains between 6 and 12% thorium oxide. The original process of \"cracking\" monazite to extract the thorium and lanthanide contents was by heating it with concentrated sulfuric acid at between 120 and 150\u00b0C for several hours. Variations in the ratio of acid to ore, degree of heating, and the degree to which water is then added result in several different processes for separating thorium from the lanthanides. Either of these processes causes the thorium to precipitate as phosphate or pyrophosphate in its crude form, leaving behind a solution of lanthanide sulfate, which can easily be precipitated as double sodium sulfate. The acid method causes the formation of waste acids which must be considered and the loss of phosphate content in the ore. A newer process uses hot sodium hydroxide solution (73%) at about 140\u00b0C. This process allows the valuable phosphate levels in the ore to be recovered into trisodium phosphate crystals. The lanthanide/thorium hydroxide mixture can be treated with hydrochloric acid to give a solution of lanthanide chloride, and an insoluble sludge of slightly basic thorium hydroxide.

This term is used differently in various fields of study, such as philosophy, mathematics, astronomy, psychology, etc., making it difficult to provide a clear and non-controversial universal definition regardless of the appropriate context. There is also disagreement about whether space itself is measurable or part of a measurement system. Science itself considers that space is a fundamental unit, namely a unit that cannot be defined by other units. The definition of space is usually more spatial in nature, while in reality the space is closely integrated with a group of people with all their activities within a certain period of time, in the study of environmental architecture and behavior, the term setting tends to be used more. The term setting places more emphasis on elements of human activity that are not clearly visible in terms of space. In Geography Studies: An Approach and Spatial Analysis (1981), Nursid Sumaatmadja describes the definition of space. Space is a place on the surface of the earth, either as a whole or only in part, that is used by living things to live. Space can also be interpreted as a container for all human, animal and plant activities on the surface of the earth. Space is not only limited to air in contact with the earth's surface. But also the lowest layer of the atmosphere that affects the earth's surface. Space also includes waters that are on the surface of the earth, namely seas, rivers, lakes, or those that are below the surface of the earth (groundwater) to a certain depth. Quoted from Education Standards, the concept of space is a concept that focuses on the location and spatial distribution, as well as how people organize and manage the space they live in.",

He is also often depicted standing on the back of an odd-looking beast with a lion's body and a scorpion's tail chasing a giant lion with a bird's tail, legs and wings. Ninurta first appears in ancient texts in the early third millennium BC (BC) as the agricultural god of the city of Girsu (from which his other names Ningirsu or city god of Girsu are derived) and the city of Larak (known as Pabilsag). Girsu and Larak were part of Sumer. Ninurta was the child of Enlil and Ninhursag but in some stories, his parents were Enlil and Ninlil. Ninurta was married to Gula, the goddess of healing (although in some inscriptions, as Ningirsu he was married to the goddess Bau). Around 1500 BC, Ninurta was still the god of agriculture.

From mainland India (Goa), this music first entered Malacca and was later played by slaves from Maluku. The weakening of the Portuguese influence in the 17th century in the archipelago did not necessarily mean the loss of this music. The earliest form of this music was called moresco (a dance of Spanish origin, such as polka with a slightly sluggish rhythm), in which Kusbini's re-composed song is now known as Kr. Muritsku, accompanied by string instruments. Keroncong music originating from Tugu is called kroncong Tugu. During its development, a number of traditional Indonesian elements were incorporated, such as the use of the flute and several gamelan components. Around the 19th century this mixed musical form was already popular in many places in the archipelago, even as far as the Malay Peninsula. This golden age continued until around the 1960s, and then faded due to the influx of popular music waves (rock music that developed since 1950, and the triumph of the Beatles and the like from 1961 until now).

This man from the city of Surakarta (Solo) even gets compensation every year from the Japanese government for successfully introducing keroncong music there. One of his most famous songs is the Bengawan Solo song. Because of his dedication, Gesang was nicknamed \"Keroncong Crocodile\" by Indonesian keroncong people, a term for keroncong music experts. Gesang called the keroncong rhythms of the STAMBUL TIME (1880-1920), which developed in Jakarta (Tugu, Kemayoran, and Gambir) as Fast Keroncong; whereas after the center of development moved to Solo (KERONCONG PERIOD: 1920-1960) the rhythm became slower. The origin of the nickname \"Keroncong Crocodile\" for Gesang revolves around his song, \"Bengawan Solo\". Bengawan Solo is the name of a river in the Surakarta region. As is known, crocodiles have habitat in swamps and rivers. The largest reptile in its habitat is almost invincible, because it is a ferocious predator. Such a supposition underlies why Gesang is called the \"Keroncong Crocodile\".

One example is the inscription. Inscriptions are a source of written evidence (in the form of writing or pictures) in the past which can provide information about events in the past, the origin of a king or figure or genealogy or calendar.

The distinctive feature of epigraphy is transliteration which aims to make it easier to read an inscription. Epigraphy has differences and similarities with philology. What these two scientific disciplines have in common is that they both study ancient writings. The difference is, epigraphy only studies ancient writings on inscriptions, while philology only studies ancient writings in manuscript form. Another similarity between epigraphy and philology is the method used in the form of text criticism. Epigraphy aims to make the inscriptions found in excavations readable.

The epigrapher has to read the worn passages over and over again to get a satisfactory reading.

Throughout human history, slavery has been an aspect of civilization, and was once legal in most of the world's societies, but is now outlawed in all countries of the world. In traditional slavery (chattel slavery), people who are legally enslaved are considered the private property (chattel) of the slave owner. In economics, the term de facto slavery refers to the forced labor conditions experienced by the majority of slaves. In 2019, around 40 million people, of whom 26 percent were children, were enslaved worldwide despite being illegal. In the modern world, more than 50 percent of people are enslaved to perform forced labor, usually in factories in a country's private sector. In industrialized countries, human trafficking is a modern form of slavery; in non-industrialized countries, debt bondage is a common form of enslavement, such as captive domestic service, forced marriage, and child soldiers. The word slave (English: slave) in English was adopted from the Old French sclave.",

Use of the word arose during the Early Medieval Period, when Slavic peoples from Central and Eastern Europe (Saqaliba) were often enslaved by Moors from the Iberian Peninsula and North Africa. There is debate among historians about whether terms such as \"forced laborers\" or \"enslaved persons\" were better used than \"slaves\" for victims of slavery. According to those who proposed changing the terminology, the term slave perpetuated the crime of slavery by reducing its victims to nouns and non-humans. Other historians prefer slaves because the term is more familiar and shorter, or because it accurately reflects the inhumane practice of slavery, and vice versa, people say it implicitly indicates a level of autonomy possessed that slavery simply did not exist. As an institutionalized social practice, traditional slavery denies human agency or autonomy and legally degrades their human status and status into goods (chattel) owned by their owners; therefore slaves are supposed to give birth to slaves; children of slaves were also born as slaves, under the legal doctrine of 2100 BC, the Law of Ur-Nammu (\"4. If a slave marries a slave, and the slave is set free, he does not leave the house. 5.

Beginning in the 18th century, the abolitionist movement saw slavery as a violation of everyone's rights as human beings (\"all men are created equal\"), and sought to abolish it. This movement was successful; the last Western country to abolish slavery was Brazil in 1888. The last third world country to abolish slavery was Mauritania, which maintained the practice of slavery until 1981. Another form of chattel slavery is sexual slavery, which often takes place in a military context, including incarceration in \" rape camps\" or \"consolation stations\", \"comfort women\", \"forced marriages\" to soldiers and other practices involving the treatment of women or men as property. All of these practices were violations of the fundamental international norms (jus cogens) which prohibit slavery.

Forced, or precarious, labor is the term used to describe someone who is forced to work against their will, under the threat of violence or other punishment, but the general term precarious labor is also used to describe enslavement of property (chattel), as well as any other situation where a person is obliged to work against his will, and a person's ability to work productively is under the full control of another person. citation needed] This may also include institutions not normally classified as slavery, such as peasant slavery, compulsory military and penal labor.

Marriage by kidnapping occurs in many parts of the world today, with a 2003 study finding a national average of 69% of marriages in Ethiopia were consummated by kidnapping. The term slavery is often used pejoratively to describe any activity in which a person is forced to perform that activity. Some argue that conscription and other forms of government forced labor amount to \"state-operated slavery\". Some libertarians and anarcho-capitalists view government taxes as a form of slavery. Some animal rights advocates have used the term slavery to refer to the condition of some or all animals owned by humans, arguing that their status is the same as that of human slaves. The labor market, as institutionalized under contemporary capitalist systems, has been criticized by mainstream socialists and by anarcho-syndicalists, who use the term wage slavery as a pejorative for wage labour. Socialists contrast trade in commodity labor with slavery. Cicero is also known to have made such comparisons. In practice, a slave was privately owned by individuals and also came under state ownership.

The internment camps of totalitarian regimes such as the Nazis and the Soviet Union emphasized the importance of the labor provided in the camps, leading historians to refer to such a system as slavery. Economists have modeled the circumstances under which slavery (and variants such as peasant slavery) appeared and disappeared. One observation suggests that slavery became more desirable for landowners when land was abundant but labor was scarce, so land rents fell and paid workers could demand higher wages. If the opposite were the case, it would have been more expensive for the landowner to look after the slaves than to hire paid laborers who could only charge low wages because of the level of competition. So, first slavery, and then peasant slavery gradually declined in Europe as the population grew. These forms of slavery were reintroduced in America and in Russia when large areas of land existed, but only a small population existed. Slavery was more common when forms of labor were relatively simple and easy to control, such as working large-scale monoculture crops such as sugarcane and cotton, where output depended on economies of scale. This allowed labor systems, such as the gang system in the United States, to become prominent on large plantations as field workers toiled with factory-like precision. Then, each work gang is based on an internal division of labor that assigns each gang member to a task and makes each worker's performance dependent on the actions of the other workers.

Since the 18th century, critics have argued that slavery hindered technological progress because its focus was on increasing the number of slaves performing simple tasks rather than increasing their efficiency. For example, it has been argued that because of this scant focus on forms of work, technology in Greece \u2013 and later in Rome \u2013 was not applied to facilitate physical labor or improve manufacturing. Scottish economist Adam Smith said that free labor was economically better than slave labor. However, Smith continued, it would be nearly impossible to end the practice of slavery in free, democratic, or republican systems of government because many legislators or political figures were slave owners, and would not punish themselves. He further stated that slaves would be better able to gain freedom under a centralized government, or a centralized authority such as a king or church. Similar arguments appear later in the work of Auguste Comte, particularly with regard to Smith's support of the concept of the separation of powers, or what Comte called \"the spiritual and temporal separation\" during the Middle Ages and the end of slavery. As Smith stated in his Lectures on Jurisprudence, \"The great power of the clergy consorting with the king could free the slaves. But this required the condition that the authority of the king and the clergy must be great.

The average annual profit made by a slave in 2007 was $3,175, with the lowest average being $950 for forced labor and $29,210 for trafficked sex slaves. About 40% of the annual profits of slaves are generated by traded sex slaves, representing more than 4% of the world's 29 million slaves. Throughout history, slaves dressed in distinctive ways, such as rarely wearing footwear, as they were usually forced to go barefoot. This is largely due to economic reasons, but it is also characteristic, especially in South Africa and South America. For example, Cape Town's slave laws stated that \"Slaves must be barefoot and must carry a permit.\" It also placed slaves at a physical disadvantage due to a lack of protection against environmental conditions and in situations of confrontation, thus making it more difficult for them to escape or rebel against their owners. This is the case in most countries. Most of the images from the historical period show slaves barefoot. Brother Riemer said, \"slaves], even in their most beautiful garments, were obliged to go barefoot. Slaves were forbidden to wear shoes. This was the chief sign of the difference between the free and the bonded and no exceptions were permitted.\" According to the Bible, shoes have been considered a badge of freedom since ancient times: \"But the father said to his servants, Bring the finest robes, and put them on; and put the ring on his hand, and the shoes on his feet]\" (Luke 15:22: KJV).",

In certain societies this rule continues. Tuareg still unofficially practice slavery and force their slaves to go barefoot. Another widespread practice is branding, either to explicitly mark them as property or as slaves for punishment. Depending on the time and country, slaves sometimes had limited legal rights. For example, in the Province of New York, it was punishable by a 1686 law to intentionally kill slaves. There were also certain legal rights attached to nobi in Korea, to enslaved people in various African societies, and to black female slaves in the French colony of Louisiana. Giving slaves legal rights was sometimes based on morality, but sometimes it was also based on self-interest. For example, in ancient Athens, protecting slaves from mistreatment could simultaneously protect people who might be mistaken for slaves, and giving slaves limited property rights could encourage slaves to work harder for more profit. In the southern United States before the abolition of slavery in 1865, a legal treatise in favor of slavery reported that slaves accused of crimes usually had legal rights to counsel, freedom from double harm, the right to be tried by a jury in more serious cases, and the right to a grand jury indictment, but they lacked many other rights such as the ability for white adults to control their own lives.

These slavery practices included debt bondage, punishment for crimes, slavery of prisoners of war, slavery of foundlings, and slavery of the descendants of slaves.

Interpretations of the textual evidence of the slave class in ancient Egypt are difficult to distinguish simply by the use of different words.

Davis's estimate has been disputed by other historians, such as David Earle, who say that the true picture of European slaves is clouded by the fact that corsairs also confiscated white non-Christians from eastern Europe. In addition, the number of slaves traded was hyperactive, with overestimates relying on peak years to calculate the average over centuries, or millennia. There is therefore wide fluctuation from year to year, particularly in the 18th and 19th centuries, given the import of slaves, and also given the fact that, prior to the 1840s, there are no consistent records.",

Such observations, in the late 16th and early 17th centuries, include some 35,000 European Christian slaves held during this period on the Barbary Coast, across Tripoli, Tunis, but mostly in Algiers. The majority were sailors (mainly British), brought in on their boats, but others were fishermen and residents of coastal villages. However, most of these captives were people from countries close to Africa, especially Spain and Italy. This eventually led to the bombing of Algiers by an Anglo-Dutch fleet in 1816. Under the Omani Arabs, Zanzibar became East Africa's principal slave port, with as many as 50,000 enslaved Africans passing through it annually during the 19th century. Some historians estimate that between 11 and 18 million African slaves crossed the Red Sea, Indian Ocean, and the Sahara Desert from AD 650 to 1900. Eduard R\u00fcppell describes the disappearance of Sudanese slaves transported by foot to Egypt: \"after the Registered bey campaign of 1822 in mountains of the southern Nuba, almost 40,000 slaves were captured. Despite mistreatment, disease and traveling through the desert, almost 5,000 people made it to Egypt.\" WA Veenhoven wrote: \"The German doctor, Gustav Nachtigal, an eyewitness, believed that for every slaves who arrived at the market three or four died en route . . . Keltie (The Partition of Africa, London, 1920) believed that for every slave the Arabs brought to the coast, at least six died en route to or during the slavers' stampede.

In many African societies that practiced slavery, enslaved people were not treated as commodity slaves and were granted certain rights in a system similar to indentured slavery elsewhere in the world. Forms of slavery in Africa are also related to kinship structures. In many African communities, individual slavery was used as a means of increasing one's influence and broadening one's connections. This made slaves a permanent part of their master's lineage and the children of slaves could be closely related to the larger family ties. Children of slaves born into families could be integrated into their master's kinship group and rise to prominent positions in society, even to the level of chiefs in some cases. However, stigma often persisted and there may have been a strict separation between slave members of the kinship group and those related to their masters. Slavery was practiced in many forms: debt bondage, prisoner-of-war slavery, military slavery, and criminal slavery, all of which were practiced in various parts of Africa. Slavery for domestic and court purposes was widespread throughout Africa. When the Atlantic slave trade began, many local slave systems began supplying captives to slave markets for goods outside Africa. Although the Atlantic slave trade was not the only trade in slaves from Africa, it was the largest in volume and intensity. As Elikia M'bokolo wrote in Le Monde diplomaticique: The continent of Africa is running out of human resources by all possible routes. The route passed is across the Sahara, through the Red Sea, from the ports of the Indian Ocean and across the Atlantic Ocean.",

Four million enslaved people were exported via the Red Sea, another four million via Swahili ports in the Indian Ocean. Approximately nine million people along the trans-Saharan caravan route, and eleven to twenty million across the Atlantic Ocean. The trans-Atlantic slave trade reached its apogee in the late 18th century, when the largest number of slaves were captured on raiding expeditions into the interior of West Africa. These expeditions were usually carried out by African kingdoms, such as the Oyo (Yoruba) Empire, the Ashanti Empire, the Dahomey kingdom, and the Aro Confederation. It is estimated that about 15 percent of those captured died during the voyage, with mortality rates much higher in Africa itself, especially in the process of capturing and transporting Africans to ships. Slavery in America remains a contentious issue and played a key role in the history and evolution of several nations leading to revolutions, civil wars, and various uprisings. To establish itself as an American empire, Spain had to fight a relatively powerful New World civilization. The Spanish conquest of indigenous peoples in America included using indigenous people to do forced labor. The Spanish colonists were the first Europeans to use African slaves in the New World on islands such as Cuba and Hispaniola. Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas, a 16th-century Dominican monk and Spanish historian, participated in the campaign in Cuba (in Bayamo and Camag\u00fcey) and was present at the Hatuey massacre; his observations of the massacre led him to champion a social movement that would no longer use indigenous people as slaves.

The \"slave triangle\" was pioneered by Francis Drake and his associates. Many whites who arrived in North America during the 17th and 18th centuries were contracted as indentured servants. The transformation from indentured servitude to slavery was a gradual process in Virginia. The earliest legal documentation of such a shift dates back to 1640, when a negro, John Punch, was sentenced to lifelong servitude and forced to serve his master, Hugh Gwyn, for the rest of his life, for attempting to escape. This case is significant because it shows the difference between the punishment of a black man and the two white indentured servants who fled with him (one described as Dutch and one as Scottish). This was the first documented case of a black man being sentenced to life in prison and is considered one of the first legal cases to make a racial distinction between black and white indentured employees. After 1640, plantation owners began to ignore the expiration of their servants' contracts and kept them as slaves for life. This was shown in the 1655 case of Johnson v. Parker. In this case, the court ruled that one black man, Anthony Johnson of Virginia, was granted possession of another black man, John Casor, as a result of a civil case. This case was the first instance of a court ruling in the Thirteen Colonies stipulating that a person who had not committed a crime could be held as a slave for life.

As yields from new crops increased, so did a shift in the ethnic composition of Barbados and the surrounding islands. A workable sugar plantation required a large investment and a lot of heavy labour. Initially, Dutch traders supplied equipment, financing, and enslaved Africans, as well as transporting most of the sugar to Europe. In 1644, the population of Barbados was estimated at 30,000, and about 800 people were of African descent, with the remainder being of English descent. These small British farmers were eventually bought out, and the island was made into a large sugar plantation worked by enslaved Africans. In 1660, there were nearly 27,000 blacks and 26,000 whites who were enslaved. By 1666, at least 12,000 white farmers had been bought out, died, or left the island. Many of the white people who remained became increasingly poor. In 1680, there were 17 slaves for each indentured servant. In 1700, 15,000 enslaved whites became free and 50,000 Africans who remained enslaved. Due to the introduction of slave laws, which created differential treatment between Africans and the white working and plantation-owning classes, the island became less and less attractive to poor white people. Slave laws were implemented in 1661, 1676, 1682, and 1688. These slave laws led to several planned slave revolts, but none were successful.

When the Portuguese colonizers entered, they relied heavily on native labor during the early phases of colonization to maintain a subsistence economy, and the natives were often captured by expeditions called bandeiras. The import of African slaves began in the mid-16th century, but the enslavement of indigenous people continued into the 17th and 18th centuries. During the era of the Atlantic slave trade, Brazil imported more African slaves than any other country. Nearly 5 million slaves were brought from Africa to Brazil during the period 1501 to 1866. Until the early 1850s, most enslaved Africans arriving on the coast of Brazil were forced to depart from West Central African ports, mainly in Luanda (now Angola). Today, with the exception of Nigeria, the country with the largest population of people of African descent is Brazil. Slave labor was the driving force behind the growth of Brazil's sugar economy, and sugar was the colony's main export from 1600 to 1650. Gold and diamond deposits were discovered in Brazil in 1690, which then fueled increased imports of African slaves to fuel new markets that this profitable. A transportation system was developed for the mining infrastructure, and the population soared with the arrival of immigrants who wanted to take part in the mining of gold and diamonds. The demand for African slaves did not diminish after the decline of the mining industry in the second half of the 18th century. Cattle farming and food production developed after population growth, both of which depended heavily on slave labor. 1.7 million slaves were imported into Brazil from Africa from 1700 to 1800, and the rise of the coffee industry in the 1830s further fueled the expansion of the slave trade.",

In 1789, the Kingdom of Spain began efforts to reform slavery as the demand for slave labor in Cuba grew. The king issued an edict, C\u00f3digo Negro Espa\u00f1ol (Spanish Black Codex), which established provisions for food and clothing, limited the number of hours worked, limited punishments, required religious instruction, protected marriages, and prohibited the sale of children away from their mothers. The British made other changes to the institution of slavery in Cuba. But industrial plantation owners often break the law and protest against it. They perceive these restrictions as a threat to their authority and interfere with their private lives. The slave owners did not protest all the rules in the Codex because many of the rules in it they felt were common practice. They object to attempts to limit their ability to apply corporal punishment. For example, the Black Codex limits canings to 25 and requires canings \"not cause serious bruising or bleeding.\" Slave owners assumed that slaves would interpret these restrictions as a weakness of the slavery system, which would eventually lead to resistance. Another contentious issue was the limited hours of work \"from sunrise to sunset\"; The plantation owners responded by saying that the cutting and processing of the cane required 20 hours a day during the harvest season.

The conditions for the baracons are very harsh, very unhealthy and very hot. Usually the place has no ventilation; the only window is a small barred hole in the wall. The Cuban slavery system was based on gender so some tasks were performed only by male slaves, some only by female slaves. Slave women in Havana from the 16th century onwards performed tasks such as operating the city's taverns, restaurants, and inns, as well as being laundresses and domestic workers and servants. Slaves also served as city prostitutes. Some Cuban women were able to find freedom by having children with white men. As in other Latin cultures, there are looser boundaries with mulatto or mixed-race populations. Sometimes men who took slaves as wives or concubines freed them and their children. As in New Orleans and Saint-Domingue, mulattoes began to be classified as a third group between European colonizers and African slaves. Freed people, mostly of mixed race, represent 20% of the total Cuban population and 41% of the non-white Cuban population.

Slaves who misbehaved or disobeyed their masters were often placed in storerooms deep in the boiler house, where they were left for days, and often two to three months. These boiler rooms are made in two types: reclining or standing type. In those days, women were punished, even when pregnant. They were subjected to the whip: they had to lie \"face down on the ground] which had been dug up to protect their bellies.\" Some slave owners reportedly whipped pregnant women on their stomachs, so that they often had miscarriages. Their injuries were treated with \"tobacco leaf compresses, urine and salt.\" Slavery in Haiti began with the arrival of Christopher Columbus on the island in 1492.

In 1789, about 40,000 white colonists lived in Saint-Domingue.

The Spaniards who arrived later enslaved many of the Taino people; some fled, but most died of plague from Europe and from overwork. The Spaniards also introduced the first African slaves. The Spanish conquistadors did not take women with them on their first expeditions. They took Ta\u00edno women as their wives, who then produced mestizo children.

African slaves were legally branded with hot irons on their foreheads to prevent their \"theft\" or lawsuits challenging their captivity. Colonizers continued this branding practice for more than 250 years. They were sent to work in the gold mines, or in the ginger and sugar fields on the island. They were allowed to live with their families in a hut on their master's land, and were given plots of land so they could farm, but they were also subjected to harsh treatment; including sexual harassment because the majority of colonists came without women; many of them married Africans or Ta\u00ednos. Their mixed-race descendants formed the first generation of the early Puerto Rican population.

Slaves were allowed to earn money during their free time by working as shoemakers, cleaning clothes, or selling the produce they grew on their own land.

Punishments were most often meted out for disobedience or committed trespasses, but sometimes abuse was used to reassert the dominance of a slave master or overseer. Harsh treatment usually occurred on large plantations which were often managed by slave overseers in the absence of the plantation owners. William Wells Brown, who escaped from the plantations, reported that on one plantation, male slaves were required to pick 80 pounds of cotton per day, while women were required to pick 70 pounds per day; if any of the slaves failed their quota, they would be whipped for every pound that was lacking.

Chinese Muslim Sufis (Tungans) accused of practicing xiejiao (heterodox religion), were punished with exile to Xinjiang and sold into slavery to other Muslims, such as the Baig Sufis. Han people who committed crimes such as abusing opium were punished as slaves to the Baig people. This practice was regulated by Qing law. Most Chinese in Altishahr were exiled slaves of the Turkestani Baig people. Although free Chinese traders generally did not engage in relations with East Turkistan women, some Chinese slaves belonging to the Baig people, along with Green Standard soldiers, Banners men, and Manchus, were involved in extramarital affairs with East Turkistan women. Slavery in India was widespread in the 6th century BC, and perhaps even in the Vedic period. The practice of slavery increased during the Muslim domination of northern India after the 11th century. Slavery also existed in Portuguese India after the 16th century. The Dutch, too, had Abyssian slaves, known in India as Habshis or Sheedes. Arakan/Bengal, Malabar and Coromandel remained the largest sources of forced labor until the 1660s. Between 1626 and 1662, the Dutch exported an average of 150\u2013400 slaves annually from the Arakan-Bengal coast. During Batavia's first 30 years, Indian and Arakan slaves provided the main workforce of the Dutch East India Company, as its Asian headquarters.",

Reportedly, more than 150,000 people were taken by the invading Deccani Muslim army into Bijapur and Golconda. In 1646, 2,118 slaves were exported to Batavia, mostly from South Coromandel. Some slaves were also procured further south in Tondi, Adirampatnam and Kayalpatnam. Another increase in slavery occurred between 1659 and 1661 from Tanjavur as a result of the ongoing series of Bijapuri raids. In Nagapatnam, Pulicat and elsewhere, the company bought 8,000-10,000 slaves, most of whom were sent to Ceylon, while small portions were exported to Batavia and Malacca. Finally, in 1673, after a long drought in Madurai and south Coromandel which intensified the protracted Madurai-Maratha struggle over Tanjavur and its punitive fiscal practices, thousands of people from Tanjavur, mostly children, were sold into slavery and exported by Asian traders from Nagapattinam to Aceh, Johor, and other slave markets. In September 1687, 665 slaves were exported by the British from Fort St. George, Madras. And in 1694\u20131696, as war once again engulfed South India, a total of 3,859 slaves were imported from Coromandel by persons private to Ceylon. The total volume of the Dutch Indian Ocean slave trade is estimated to be about 15\u201330% of the Atlantic slave trade, slightly less than the trans-Saharan slave trade, and one and a half to three times the size of the Swahili and Red Sea coast slave trade and the Dutch West India Company slave trade.

Many documents mention the slave trade occurring concurrently with protests against Japanese slavery. Japanese slaves are believed to have been the first of their kind to go to Europe, and the Portuguese purchased a number of Japanese slave girls to bring to Portugal for sexual purposes, as recorded by the Church in 1555. Japanese slave women were even sold as concubines to irregulars Asian and African crew members, along with their European counterparts who served on Portuguese ships trading in Japan, as mentioned by Luis Cerqueira, a Portuguese Jesuit, in a 1598 document.

Fillippo Sassetti saw some Chinese and Japanese slaves in Lisbon among the large slave community in 1578, even though most of the slaves were black. The Portuguese \"respected\" Asian slaves more than slaves from sub-Saharan Africa. The Portuguese people appreciated qualities such as intelligence and craftsmanship displayed by Chinese and Japanese slaves. King Sebastian of Portugal feared that rampant slavery would negatively impact the spread of Catholicism, so he ordered slavery outlawed in 1571. Hideyoshi was disgusted that many Japanese were being sold en masse into slavery in Kyushu. He then wrote to the Jesuit Representative of Gaspar Province, Coelho Jesuit, on July 24, 1587 demanding that the Portuguese, Siam (Thai), and Cambodians stop buying and enslaving Japanese and return Japanese slaves who reached India. Hideyoshi blamed the Portuguese and Jesuits for the slave trade and banned the spread of Christianity as a result.

In addition, due to population growth, many escaped slaves , the growing commercialization of agriculture, and the emergence of an independent class of small farmers contributed to a decline in the number of nobi to about 1.5% of the total population in 1858. The hereditary nobi system was formally abolished around 1886-1887, and other nobi systems were abolished with The Gabo reforms in 1894. However, slavery did not completely disappear in Korea until 1930 and returned during the Japanese occupation. During the Japanese Empire's occupation of Korea around World War II, some Koreans were required to perform forced labor in conditions equated to slavery. This forced labor included women who were forced into sex slavery by the Japanese Imperial Army before and during World War II, known as \"lanfu\".

Until the late 18th century, the Crimean Khanate (a Tatar Muslim state) maintained a large slave trade with the Ottoman Empire and the Middle East. Many slaves were captured in southern Russia, Poland-Lithuania, Moldavia, Wallachia and Circassia by Tatar horsemen and sold in the Crimean port of Kaffa. About 2 million slaves (mostly Christian slaves) were exported during the 16th and 17th centuries until the Crimean Khanate was destroyed by the Russian Empire in 1783. The market for captured Russian and Persian slaves was centered in the Khiva Khanate in Central Asia.

This ideology of difference and violence of human exploitation leaves a lasting legacy in contemporary Russia. Historian Anne Applebaum writes in the introduction to her book that the word GULAG has come to represent \"the Soviet slave labor system itself, in all its forms and variations\": The word \"GULAG\" is an acronym for Glavnoe Upravlenie Lagerei, or Main Camp Administration, the agency that administered the Soviet camps .

On February 25, 2007, the Commonwealth of Virginia expressed \"deep regret\" and apologized for its role in the institution of slavery. In a US first, the apology passed unanimously in both houses of parliament as Virginia nears the 400th anniversary of the founding of Jamestown. On 24 August 2007, Mayor Ken Livingstone of London publicly apologized for Britain's role in the colonial slave trade. \"You can look across there to see the institutions that are still benefiting from the wealth they created from slavery,\" he said, gesturing to the financial district. He claimed that London was still tainted by the horrors of slavery. In particular, London outfitted, financed and insured many of the ships, which helped finance the construction of the London wharves. Officials in Liverpool, the city that was once a major slave trading port, apologized in 1999. On July 30, 2008, the United States House of Representatives passed a resolution expressing an apology for American slavery and the discriminatory laws that followed. In June 2009, the US Senate passed a resolution apologizing to African Americans for \"fundamental injustice, cruelty, brutality and inhuman slavery\". The news was welcomed by President Barack Obama, the first president who is of African descent. Some of President Obama's ancestors may have been slave owners.",

Also: This verse refers to a believer, who is commanded to continue to believe, and explains the many conditions of faith. The difference between believers and those who submit is one of the important points in the emergence of the teachings of Sufism which emphasizes faith that is inner (heart). Sufism itself is the knowledge and procedures (practice) to reach that state of certainty, in addition to the station of lovers of Allah. They know the secrets of the heart and understand the basic psychoanalyst theory, namely the conscious and subconscious (heart). \"Indeed, the heart can only be subdued by faith\" (Al-Ghazali/Ihya Ulumuddin) An understanding of the difference between a person who submits and a person who believes in the heart (heart) can be further understood by studying psychoanalytic theory, that humans have two important components in themselves namely the conscious and subconscious. The subconscious is where desires and emotions emerge. In psychoanalysis, the deepest belief lies in the subconscious and it is this belief that drives our desires. For example, if the belief in the subconscious says that \"wealth is the parameter of glory\", then our desire will try to find treasure, but the belief in the subconscious says that \"God is the parameter of glory\", then the desire will automatically seek God.",

Aztec society consisted of various ethnic groups that inhabited central Mexico, especially the Nahuatl-speaking peoples who inhabited most of Mesoamerica from the 14th to the 16th centuries. The Aztec civilization gave birth to a number of city-states (altepetl). Some of these combined to form alliances, political confederations, even empires. The Aztec Empire was a confederation of three city-states formed in 1427, namely Tenochtitlan (the city-state of the Mexica or Tenochca people), Texcoco, and Tlacopan. The city-state of Tlacopan was formerly part of the Tepanek Empire centered on the city-state of Azcapotzalco. Although often used as a specific designation for the Tenochtitlan Mexica, the term Aztec was also used as a general term for the city-states and Nahua peoples of central Mexico during pre-Spanish times as well as during the Spanish colonial period (1521\u20131821). The definition of Aztecs and Aztecs has long been a topic of scientific discussion since the German scientist, Alexander von Humboldt, made use of it common in the early 19th century. Most of the peoples of central Mexico in the Postclassic period shared basic Mesoamerican cultural features, and a large number of Aztec cultural characteristics cannot simply be called unique to the Aztecs. For the same reason, the notion of \"Aztec civilization\" is best understood as one of the special scopes of the general civilization of Mesoamerica. The civilization of central Mexico includes the cultivation of maize, the division of society into aristocrats (pipiltin) and commoners (macehualtin), the worship of many gods (Tezcatlipoca, Tlaloc, and Quetzalcoatl), and the xiuhpohualli calendar (365 day calendar) which is inserted by the system the tonalpohualli calendar (260 day calendar).",

It was a tributary empire that extended its political hegemony far beyond the Valley of Mexico by subjugating other city-states throughout Mesoamerica in the late Postclassic.

The ruler of Tlatelolco named Moquihuix was previously married to the sister of Axayacatl. Allegations of cruel treatment of his wife were used as a pretext to invade Tlatelolco so that Tenochtitlan could control its market. Axayacatl then conquered the central Guerrero region and also fought against the Otomi and Matlatzinca tribes in the Toluca Valley. The Toluca Valley is the region that separated the Aztecs from the Tarascan state of Michoacan. Axayacatl then waged war against Taraska (Nahuatl: Michhuahqueh), but in 1478\u201379, Taraska drove back the Aztec forces. Axayacatl suffered a heavy defeat at the battle of Tlaximaloyan (now Tajimaroa), as a result most of his 32,000 soldiers died in battle and he was barely able to escape to Tenochtitlan with the rest of his army. After Axayacatl's death in 1481, his older brother, Tizoc, was elected ruler. To coincide with his coronation, he waged a \"coronation war\" against the Otomi tribe in Metztitlan, but he failed and was only able to get 40 captives to sacrifice in his coronation ceremony. This was seen as a sign of the new ruler's weakness, resulting in many tributary cities revolting, and Tizoc's brief reign was preoccupied with trying to quell rebellions and retain territories previously conquered by his predecessors. Tizoc died suddenly in 1485, although it is possible that he was poisoned by his brother, Ahuitzotl, who later succeeded him as tlatoani. Tizoc is best known for the origin of the name the Tizoc Stone, a monumental sculpture (Nahuatl: temalacatl) depicting Tizoc's conquests. The next ruler was Ahuitzotl (Nahuatl: \"water monster\"), brother of Axayacatl and Tizoc.",

For the inauguration ceremony, they invited the lords of all the cities that had been subjugated. They then witness a terrible human sacrifice ceremony. Some sources estimate that 80,400 captives were killed in four days. It's likely that the actual number of victims was much smaller, but the figure was still in the thousands. Ahuitzotl also erected monumental buildings in places such as Calixtlahuaca, Malinalco and Tepoztlan. After an uprising broke out in the towns of Alahuiztlan and Oztoticpac in northern Guerrero, he ordered all residents in those towns to be massacred and replaced by settlers from the Valley of Mexico. He also set up defenses in Oztuma to deal with threats from the Taraska nation. Motecuzoma II Xocoyotzin is best known as a ruler during a time when the Aztecs were undermined by the Spaniards and their allies in Mesoamerica. He rose to power after Ahuitzotl's death. Motecuzoma Xocoyotzin (Nahuatl: \"he looks somber like a ruler, youngest son\") was a child of Axayacatl, and also had previous experience as a warlord. His reign began as usual.

He sent messengers to greet them, and he ordered his subordinates in the region to keep him posted when any other foreigners arrived. In 1519, he received news of the arrival of a Spanish fleet led by Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s. Cort\u00e9s then went to Tlaxcala and formed an alliance with the Aztecs' sworn enemy.

When Aztec troops destroyed a Spanish encampment on the shores of the Gulf of Mexico, Cort\u00e9s ordered Motecuzoma that he execute the commanders responsible for the attack, and Motecuzoma complied. By this time, the Spaniards had Motecuzoma captive in his own palace. Motecuzoma's subordinates saw this clearly, and so they hated the Spaniards even more. In June 1520, strife resulted in the massacre at the Templo Mayor, and then the Mexica rebelled against the Spanish. Motecuzoma died during this conflict, probably killed by the Spaniards when they fled Tenochtitlan or by the Mexica themselves because he was branded a traitor.

In the Aztec family system, inheritance went to sons and daughters. Therefore, women can own property like men, as a result they enjoy considerable economic freedom. Men and women in Aztec society were required to fulfill their gender roles. Men worked outside the home as farmers, traders, artisans and soldiers, while women took care of the household. Even so, women can also become petty traders, doctors, priests, and midwives. In addition, fighting was a highly valued activity in Aztec society, and women's work is metaphorically likened to war. Women's work was also considered equally important in maintaining the balance of the world and in satisfying the gods. Therefore, experts describe Aztec gender ideology not as an ideology that regulates gender hierarchies, but as an ideology with complementary gender roles; in other words, the roles are separate, but considered equal. Among the nobility, marriage is often used as a political strategy. The lower nobility married off their daughters to men from more prestigious lineages, and this more prestigious status would then be passed on to their children. Nobles often practiced polygamy. However, polygamy was not common among the common people, and some sources even state that the practice was banned.

In the Basin of Mexico, the altepetl divided into calpolli, which served as the organizational unit for the common people. In Tlaxcala and the Puebla Valley, the altepetl consisted of teccalli units headed by a lord (Nahuatl: tecutli) who controlled the area and distributed land rights among the people. Calpolli was once a territorial unit where people worked and cultivated the land, because the land was not privately owned. Sometimes calpolli also become a kinship unit such as a network of families connected to each other through marriage. Calpolli leaders may or may not be members of the aristocratic class, and if they are, they can represent the interests of the calpollis in the altepetl government.

        "paragraph": "The Aztec Empire was ruled indirectly. Like European empires, the Aztec Empire was inhabited by various ethnic groups. However, the two cannot be equated, as the Aztec Empire was a system of tribute collection and not a centralized system of government. Historian Ross Hassig argues that the Alliance of the Three Aztecs should be classified as an unofficial or hegemonic empire, since states did not have absolute power over conquered territory; they only asked for tribute, and the military would only be deployed to those areas to ensure the payment of tribute. The Alliance of the Three Aztecs was also a disjointed empire; for example, the region of Xoconochco which is located in the far southeast is completely disconnected from the Aztec core region. The hegemonic nature of the Aztec Empire can be seen in the fact that local lords were restored to power after their city-states were conquered, and the Aztecs usually did not interfere in local affairs as long as tribute was paid. These city-states were made obedient by means of a network of elites who were linked together through marriage relations or other kinds of exchange. Even so, the Aztec Empire was able to expand their territory by controlling strategic areas on the border. Their approach to this kind of territory is direct, and they don't hesitate to send troops to conquer and control the territory. Strategic areas were often not subject to tribute. The Aztecs even attempted to solidify their rule in the region by deploying troops, installing a puppet ruler, or even moving the population from the center. Thus, the territories that lay outside the Aztec core of the Valley of Mexico were distinguished by their strategic importance. Some areas were made tributary provinces, and the tribute ensured economic stability in the empire, while others were strategic provinces that served as the basis for expanding territories.",

Altpetl is ruled by a tlatoani from a legitimate noble family. At the beginning of Aztec history, altepetls experienced rapid growth and competition. The altepetl was still the main form of organization at the local level even after the formation of the Alliance of the Three Aztecs in 1427. One of the reasons why the Aztec Empire was able to maintain its hegemony was because the altepetl was a powerful regional political unit. Like other peoples in Mesoamerica, the Aztecs relied heavily on maize farming. Besides maize, major crops in the Aztec civilization included beans, pumpkin, chili peppers, and amaranth. Intensive farming was made possible by the humid environment of the Valley of Mexico and the presence of lakes and marshes. One of the most important methods in such environments is chinampa, artificial islands that can transform shallow water into highly fertile plantations that can be cultivated all year round. Chinampa is made from layers of mud that come from the bottom of the lake and also from various plants. The artificial islands are separated by small canals, and farmers can move from one island to another by canoe. The soil in the chinampa is very fertile, and an average of seven times a year can be harvested. Based on the current yield of chinampa, it is estimated that one hectare of chinampa can feed 20 people, while 9,000 hectares of chinampa can feed 180,000 people. The Aztec people further advanced their agriculture by building irrigation systems.

After Tenochtitlan became a large city, water was supplied through an aqueduct from a spring on the lake's edge, and they also set up a system for collecting human waste to be used as fertilizer. Thanks to their ability to grow crops, Aztec agriculture was able to meet the food needs of residents in large cities. Lakes are also a rich source of protein from aquatic animals such as fish, amphibians, shrimp, insects and insect eggs, as well as waterfowl. Thanks to the availability of a variety of protein sources, they have little need for the meat of domesticated animals (they only have turkey and dogs), and experts have estimated that the inhabitants of the Valley of Mexico do not lack protein. Thanks to a surplus of food, the Aztecs were able to work outside the field of food production. In addition to ensuring the availability of food at home, women make woven fabrics from agave and cotton. Men also made ceramics, obsidian and chert tools, or luxury goods such as beads and bird feathers and musical instruments. Sometimes all of the calpollis do only one kind of craft. In several archaeological sites, large areas have even been found that only focus on one craft only. The Aztecs did not make much metal work, but they had mastered the technology of smelting gold, and they fused gold with other precious stones such as jade and turquoise. Items made of copper were usually imported from Taraska. Products are distributed in market networks; some markets specialize in one type of commodity (for example the dog market in Acolman), while others trade a wide variety of goods.

The rest of the traders are professional traders who come from one market to another to make a profit. Pochteca is a long-distance merchant who belongs to guilds. They traveled to various regions of Mesoamerica and brought back exotic luxury goods, and they acted as judges and overseers in the markets of Tlatelolco. The Aztec economy was highly commercialized, but land and labor were not considered commodities, although some nobles could trade certain types of land with each other. There were several types of money in the Aztec civilization. Low value goods are purchased using cocoa beans (which must be imported from the plains). In Aztec bazaars, a small rabbit cost 30 chicks, a turkey egg cost 3 chicks, and a tamale equals one chick. For more expensive items, the money used was a standard length cotton cloth called a quachtli. There are all kinds of quachtli, from 65 to 300 cocoa beans worth. The money needed to support the life of a commoner for a year in Tenochtitlan is 20 quachtli. Altepetl, which was conquered by the Aztecs, was forced to pay tribute.

On the one hand, the Aztec Empire supported trade activities, and exotic goods from obsidian to bronze were enjoyed by both commoners and royalty. Their trading partners also included the Pur\u00e9pecha (also known as the Taraska), who supplied the Aztecs with bronze tools and jewelry. On the other hand, the tribute levied by the empire was a great burden on the common people, as they had to work even harder to be able to pay the tribute. Meanwhile, the nobility usually benefited from imperial power because the imperial structure of government was not direct. The empire depended on local kings and nobles and offered them privileges if they helped keep order and keep paying tribute. As well as having a rural agricultural tradition, Aztec society had also developed an urban tradition with a complex system of institutions, specialization, and hierarchies. Urban traditions in Mesoamerica began to emerge in the Classical period after the founding of large cities such as Teotihuacan (with a population of over 100,000). By the time of the Aztec awakening, urban traditions were already deeply embedded in Mesoamerican society. City centers themselves act as religious, political, and economic centers. The Aztec capital was located at Tenochtitlan, which is today the seat of Mexico City. The city is built on a number of islets in Lake Texcoco.

The current sun, the fifth sun, was created when one of the lesser gods sacrificed himself at a bonfire and turned into the sun, but it only started moving after the other gods sacrificed themselves and offered their lives to it. Based on another myth explaining how the earth was created, Tezcatlipoca and Quetzalcoatl teamed up to defeat the giant crocodile Cipactli and make it into the earth, so that humans were allowed to dig up its flesh and plant their seeds, provided they offered blood to Cipactli in exchange. Also, according to the story of the creation of mankind, Quetzalcoatl traveled with his twin sister Xolotl to the underworld and brought bones which were then ground into corn by the goddess Cihuacoatl.

Each day has its own name and number in each calendar, and the combination of the two dates appears only every 52 years. Tonalpohualli is generally used for divination purposes.

As described in the Aztec creation myth, humans were responsible for ensuring that the sun would continue to rise, and they also had to sacrifice something to keep the earth fertile. Thus, human and animal blood sacrifices were made, depending on which god had to be satisfied and what kind of ceremony was being performed. Priests for certain gods sometimes had to shed their own blood. Cannibalism is even practiced in some rituals. The captives and members of their families ate the flesh of the captives, but it is not certain whether this practice was widespread in the Aztec civilization. Although human sacrifice was a widespread practice throughout Mesoamerica, the Aztecs (according to their own historical records) sacrificed so many lives that no other civilization in the Americas could rival them.

While it is true that the Aztec diet lacked protein, he pointed out that the Aztec diet was rich in vegetable protein. Ortiz also said that human sacrifices were more often done at harvest time, that the protein obtained from human sacrificed meat was not large, and that nobles could easily consume animal protein. Today, most scholars try to explain this practice in terms of Aztec ideology, and they also argue that the ritual sacrifice of warriors from conquered nations was a way of demonstrating political power, thus substantiating the rulers' claim that they were endowed with divine authority. . This activity was also considered important in preventing rebellions in the conquered territories, and it was especially important in the Aztec state, which had tenuous political ties. The Aztecs valued fine arts and crafts which they called toltecayotl. This term refers to the Toltec peoples who lived in central Mexico before the rise of the Aztec city-state. The Aztec people considered the Toltec culture to be the highest culture.",

The artisans who create these arts are called tolteca. The Aztecs did not have the sophisticated script that the Mayans did. However, like the Mayans and Zapotecs, they used a writing system that combined logographic signs with phonetic syllable signs. An example of using a logogram is the image of a mountain representing the word tepetl (which also means \"mountain\"), while an example of a phonetic syllable mark is the image of the tooth tlantli to represent the syllable tla in words completely unrelated to teeth. By combining these two, the Aztecs were able to symbolize the names of people and places. The narratives are usually presented in the form of a sequence of pictures using different iconographic settings, such as footprints to show the way, burning temples to depict conquests, and so on. Epigrapher Alfonso Lacadena has shown that the syllable signs used by the Aztecs could represent all of the most frequently used syllables in Nahuatl (with a few exceptions), but most scholars think that the phoneticism of these signs only took hold after the conquest. after the Spaniards introduced the principles of phonetic writing to the Aztecs. Other scholars, notably Gordon Whittaker, feel that the syllabic and phonetic aspects of Aztec writing are less systematic and more creative, and he believes that Aztec writing never developed into the fully syllabic writing system of Mayan writing. The Aztec writing instead used a variety of phonetic markers. The figure on the right shows the use of phonetic signs to write place names according to the Mendoza Codex dating from colonial times.",

Above the mountain glyph \"TEPETL\", there are phonetic signs \"MA\" (hand) and \"PCH\" (moss) to spell out the word \"mapach\" (\"raccoon\") phonetically rather than logographically. Two other place names, namely Mazatlan (\"Place of Many Deer\") and Huitztlan (\"Place of Many Thorns\"), use the phonetic element \"TLAN\" which is represented by teeth (tlantli). The \"MAZA\" (mazatl = deer) glyph was combined with the \"TLAN\" tooth signature to produce \"Mazatlan\", and similarly the \"HUITZ\" (huitztli = thorn) glyph was combined with the \"TLAN\" tooth signature to produce \"Huitztlan\". Song and poetry were highly valued in the Aztec civilization. Poetry performances and contests are often held during the festivities. There were also dramatic performances involving actors, musicians and acrobats. In addition, there are several types of cuicatl (song): Yaocuicatl dedicated to the god(s) of war, Teocuicatl for gods and creation myths, xochicuicatl for flowers (the symbol of poetry and showing the highly metaphorical nature of poetry, which often has implied meaning). Meanwhile, \"prose\" is called tlahtolli. An important element in Aztec poetry is the use of parallelism, that is, the repetition of the same forms. Aztec poetry also contains diphrasms, namely metaphors that express an abstract concept by using two more concrete concepts. For example, the Nahuatl way of expressing the word \"poetry\" is in xochitl in cuicatl, which means \"flower, song.\" Many poems of this kind were collected during the conquest. Sometimes, poetry is attributed to certain writers, such as Nezahualcoyotl (tlatoani Texcoco) and Cuacuauhtzin (ruler of Tepechpan), but it is not certain whether the poetry was actually written by them personally. Important collections of Aztec poetry include the Romances de los se\u00f1ores de la Nueva Espa\u00f1a (collected in 1582, probably by Juan Bautista de Pomar)nb 8] and Cantares Mexicanos.",

The most common type of ceramic is \"black on orange\" ceramic, which is orange ceramic decorated with black painting. Aztec ceramics with black on orange are chronologically divided into four, namely Aztec I and II (1100\u20131350), Aztec III (1350\u20131520), and Aztec IV (early colonial era). Aztec I is characterized by painted flowers and glyphs for day names; Aztec II has paintings of grass over calligraphic shapes such as s-curves or loops; Aztec III has very simple lines; Aztec IV follows patterns from pre-Columbian times, but also adds European-influenced flowers. Each region has its own variety, and archaeologists are still trying to refine the order of the four styles. Vessels that are usually used for daily purposes are pots made of clay for cooking (comalli), bowls and plates for eating (caxitl), pots for cooking (comitl), molcajete or a kind of mortar and pestle used for grinding chilies (molcaxitl). , as well as a brazier and a saucer. The vessels were heated in a simple furnace or even in an earthen pit at a low temperature. Polychrome ceramics were imported from the Cholula region (also known as the \"Mixteca-Puebla style\"), and these were considered luxury items, while black-and-orange ceramics made by local people were used for daily needs.

Of these books, it is not certain whether they were written in pre-conquest times, but some codices may have been produced shortly after the conquest before the tradition of painting was disrupted by the turmoil that swept through Mesoamerica. If some codices were indeed produced in the post-conquest period, they may have been copied from pre-Columbian originals. The Codex Borbonicus is thought to be the only pre-conquest Aztec codex that has survived to this day - it is a calendar codex that contains counting days and months and indicates the patron deity for each period. However, there are also experts who feel that the style of this codex is in accordance with the style of codices made after the conquest. The Spanish colonial government sometimes commissioned Aztec tlacuilos (codex makers), for example the Mendoza Codex. The Spanish government also occasionally commissioned codices describing pre-colonial religious practices, for example the R\u00edos Codex. However, codices with information on calendars and religious practices were systematically sought after and destroyed by the church. Meanwhile, other painting books (particularly those related to history and tribute) are still being made.

The Aztec civilization also produced a number of monumental stone carvings which are still preserved today. Such carvings usually serve as decoration for religious buildings. The most famous Aztec rock carving is the Aztec calendar stone or \"sun stone\" discovered in 1790.

The second is the temalacatl, which is a monumental stone disk covered with carvings, and prisoners of war tied to this boulder to be sacrificed by being forced to fight. There are also smaller rock carvings depicting gods. The style used in religious sculpture is austere, possibly to create an impression of power in the minds of those who see it.

One of the most valuable works of art in the Aztec civilization were feather crafts, that is, works decorated with colorful mosaics of feathers. Fur craftsmen were a highly skilled and respected class, and they were called amanteca. The name comes from the Amantla area in the city of Tenochtitlan which is where they live and work. Fur craftsmen had to go through lengthy training, and documentation in Tenochtitlan and Tlatelolco shows that fur craft skills were passed from parents to children. Overall, there are three ways to make fur crafts. The first way is by tying feathers to produce three-dimensional objects such as fans and head coverings. The second way is to stick feathers on a surface to produce a mosaic. An example of a product that can be produced in this way is a shield. The third way is to weave fur on textiles. The feathers used range from duck, turkey, crow, waterfowl, to exotic birds such as macaws, parrots, hummingbirds, or even the highly prized quetzal. \"Normal\" bristles are often used as an undercoat in the mosaic-making process, although some are made into separate crafts. These furs were obtained from trade as well as from tribute. Fur crafts are difficult to care for and maintain, so that today the number of Aztec fur crafts remaining does not reach ten. Mexico City was founded on the ruins of Tenochtitlan. The new city slowly covered Lake Texcoco and the old structures.

The Aztec ruling dynasty still ruled San Juan Tenochtitlan, which was part of Mexico City, but later the Spanish kept only puppet rulers in the area. One of them was Andr\u00e9s de Tapia Motelchiuh who was appointed by the Spanish. Other former Aztec city-states are also still inhabited by native peoples who are ruled by a gobernador of native background. At first, the office was often hereditary, and gobernador was the same as tlatoani, but the two offices later became separate in many Nahua towns. The native governors were in control of the political affairs of the natives, and they also maintained a system of tribute collection and forced labor to benefit the encomiendas of the Spaniards. Encomiendas were the giving of labor and tribute from certain groups of native peoples to the Spaniards who were bestowed with these privileges. At the start of the colonial period, several native governors were able to amass wealth and rank on a par with the Spanish encomenderos. The number of indigenous people in Mexico declined in the post-conquest era. The cause was the spread of viruses that had never existed on the American continent before, so that the natives did not have immunity against these viruses. In 1520\u20131521, variola broke out in Tenochtitlan and was one of the causes for the fall of the city; other outbreaks struck in 1545 and 1576. There is no consensus on the population of Mexico at the time the Europeans arrived.

This very high estimate has been criticized for relying on unfounded assumptions. Archaeologist William Sanders made his estimate based on archaeological evidence of homes, and he estimated the Valley of Mexico's population ranged from 1-1.2 million. Meanwhile, Whitmore used computer simulations based on colonial censuses to show that the Valley of Mexico in 1519 had a population of 1.5 million and that of Mexico as a whole had 16 million people. Therefore, to estimate how much population declined in the 16th century, all depends on the estimated population in 1519. Estimates of the percentage decline in population in the Valley of Mexico range from 50% to about 90%; Sanders and Whitmore themselves estimate that the population decline rate was as high as 90%. Even though the Aztec Empire had collapsed, some members of the highest elite were still able to enjoy their status during the colonial era. An example is the main heir Motecuzoma II and his successors. Motecuzoma's son, Pedro Moctezuma, had a son who married a woman from the Spanish nobility, and the child born from this marriage received the title Conde de Moctezuma. From 1696 to 1701, the title of Virreyes de Nueva Espa\u00f1a was held by titleholder Conde de Moctezuma. In 1766, the holder of the Conde de Moctezuma title became the Grande of Spain. In 1865 (during the Second Mexican Empire), the title Conde de Moctezuma (then held by Antonio Mar\u00eda Moctezuma-Marcilla de Teruel y Navarro) was created Duke, and the title de Tultengo was later added by King Juan Carlos I in 1992.",

During the colonial era, the Nahua people were also able to maintain various aspects of their social and political life.

Meanwhile, the rep\u00fablica de espa\u00f1oles includes not only Europeans, but also Africans and people of mixed blood. The Spaniards recognized the native elites as aristocrats in the Spanish colonial system, retaining the status differences that existed from pre-conquest times, and using these aristocrats as intermediaries between the Spanish colonial government and the common people. They were allowed to become elites as long as they converted to Catholicism and remained loyal to the Spanish Empire. The Nahua governed societies during colonial times had considerable autonomy in managing local affairs. The Spanish rulers had little understanding of the indigenous political system, but they recognized the important role of the native elites and the pre-existing system. They changed the political system by making the altepetl the basic unit of government. In colonial times, altepetl was renamed to cabecera (although they still use the name altepetl in local Nahuatl language documentation), while outer settlements ruled by cabecera were called sujeto.

The Aztec civilization has left many kinds of legacies to the world. Aztec archaeological sites have been excavated and opened to the public, while artifacts are on display in museums. Place names and loanwords from the Nahuatl language are widespread in Mexico. Aztec symbols and mythology have also blended with Mexican nationalism and become part of the country's coat of arms. In the 19th century, the image of the Aztecs as uncivilized barbarians began to change due to the romanticization of the Aztecs as an indigenous group with a highly developed culture that could rival ancient European civilizations. After Mexico succeeded in gaining independence from Spain, the romanticization of the Aztecs was utilized in the narrative used to form a new nation which was a blend of Europe and America. Aztec culture and history had been an integral part of the process of forming Mexican national identity following the country's independence in 1821. In Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries, the Aztecs were seen as barbaric, violent, and culturally lowly. However, before Mexico gained independence, the American-born Spaniards (criollos) had traced Aztec history in the search for a symbol of pride separate from Spain.

Hispanistas categorically refuse to make Mexico's ancient civilization a national and group pride.

There are also those who call it Hervormd theology, Hervormd faith, or Hervormd traditionalists. Reformed theology was developed by theologians such as Martin Bucer, Heinrich Bullinger, Peter Martyr Vermigli, and Huldrych Zwingli and was also influenced by English reformers such as Thomas Cranmer and John Jewel. But because of John Calvin's great influence and role in the confessional and ecclesiastical debates throughout the 17th century, this tradition has come to be commonly known as Calvinism. Today, the term also refers to the doctrines and practices of the Reformed Church, of which Calvin was one of its first leaders, and this system is best known for its doctrines of predestination and total desolation.-45. John Calvin's international influence in the development of Protestant Reformation doctrines begins when he was 25 years old, when he began writing his first edition of the Institutio: Teaching the Christian Religion in 1534 (published in 1536). This work underwent a number of revisions during its lifetime, including an impressive translation into colloquial French. Through the Institutes along with Calvin's polemical and pastoral works, his contributions to confessional documents for use in churches, and his generous contributions in the form of commentaries on the Bible, Calvin exerted a major personal influence on Protestantism. He was just one of many others who influenced the doctrines of the Reformed churches, although he eventually became the most prominent. Reformed churches, as well as Calvinistic ones, belong to the second stage of the Protestant Reformation, when Evangelical churches began to form after Martin Luther was expelled from the Catholic Church.",

He had signed the Augsburg Lutheran Confession of Faith after it was revised by Melanchthon in 1540, but his influence was first felt in the Swiss Reformation, which was not Lutheran in nature, but rather followed Ulrich Zwingli. From the start it was clear that the doctrine of the Reformed churches developed in a direction independent of Luther, under a number of writers and reformers, including the later prominent Calvin. Much later, when his fame was associated with the Reformed churches, his entire body of teachings came to be referred to as \"Calvinism.\" Although much of Calvin's practice took place in Geneva, his publications spread his ideas about the true reformed church to many parts of Europe. Calvinism became the theological system of the majority church in Scotland (see John Knox), the Netherlands, and parts of Germany (especially the neighboring Netherlands) and was influential in then-independent France, Hungary, Transylvania, and Poland. Calvinism was once popular in Scandinavia, especially Sweden, but was later rejected after the Uppsala synod in 1593 preferring Lutheranism. Most settlers in the Mid-Atlantic and New England, USA, were Calvinists, including French Puritans and Huguenots and Dutch settlers in New Amsterdam (New York). The Dutch Calvinist settlers were also the first successful European colonists in South Africa, dating back to the 17th century. They became known as the Boers or Afrikaners. Most of Sierra Leone is inhabited by Calvinist settlers from Nova Scotia, who are mainly black loyalists, that is, black people who fought for Britain during the American War of Independence. John Marrant founded a congregation there under the auspices of the Huntingdon Connection. Some of the largest Calvinist churches were started by missionaries of the 19th and 20th centuries; especially large ones are the churches in Indonesia, Korea and Nigeria.",

Plankton comes from the Greek word planktos which means wanderer or drifter. This term was first applied by Victor Hansen, Director of the German Expedition in 1887, known as the Plankton Expedition, which was made to determine the systematics of marine organisms. After this expedition was completed, Haeckel perfected it again in 1990. Plankton is widely considered one of the most important organisms in the world, because it provides food for aquatic life. For most sea creatures, plankton is their main food. Plankton consists of the remains of marine animals and plants. It's just small. Even though it is a kind of living thing, plankton does not have the power to fight against the currents, tides or winds that wash it away. Plankton lives on the coast where it gets sufficient supplies of mineral salts and sunlight. It is important to allow it to continue to live. Considering that plankton is food for fish, it is not surprising that there are many fish on the coast. That is why fishing activities are actively carried out in the area. In addition to the remains of animals, plankton is also created from plants. When viewed using a microscope, algae plant elements can be seen in plankton. Some sea creatures that eat plankton are coral, shellfish, and whales. Generally, the size of plankton is very small and can be measured in micrometers to millimeters. However, there are also large ones such as jellyfish which can reach two meters in size, but the distribution of this type in the sea is very small.

This region was named after the Lusitani or Lusitania people. The Lusitani people are mighty heroes whose origins are unknown. Its capital was Emerita Augusta (now M\u00e9rida). The etymology of the Lusitania, like the origin of the Lusitani people, is also unclear. The name may be of Celtic origin: Lus and Tanus, \"tribe of Lusus\". Others say that Lusitania means \"City of light\". The Romans, such as Pliny Senior (Natural History, 3.5) and Varro (cited by Pliny), speculated that the name Lusitania was of Roman origin, as when Pliny said lusum enim liberi patris aut lyssam cum eo bacchantium nomen dedisse lusitaniae et pana praefectum eius universae: that Lusitania got its name from the lusus attributed to Bacchus and the lyssa of his Bacchantes, and that Pan was its governor. Lusus is usually translated as 'game', while lyssa is a loan word from the Greek \u03bb\u03c5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1, 'drunk' or 'wrath' (and is sometimes the personification of both).

Likely, both tribes came from the mountains of Switzerland. But some others argue that the Lusitanians are an indigenous Iberian ethnic group, which was formed due to mixed marriages between various tribes. The first areas colonized by the Lusitani were probably the Douro valley and the region of Beira Alta (now Portugal); in Beira they remained until they defeated the Celtic and other tribes, then they expanded their territory to include the area of \u200b\u200bEstremadura before the arrival of the Romans. The Lusitanians are mentioned for the first time in Livy (218 BC) and are described as Carthaginian mercenaries; they reportedly fought against the Romans in 194 BC, occasionally allying themselves with other Celtiberian tribes.

The long title seems to appear as an exaltation and additional explanation for the concise title. But it should be noted that the presence of the word \"God\" in the lengthy title proves that it is a later addition to the title, and at the same time corresponds with the Evangelical passage found in the first part of the Didache text, namely the part that describes \" The Two Paths\", (1:3-2:1) in addition to the hint about the \"gospel of the Lord\" (see 8:2,15:4, 9:3,11:3,15:3), namely in the liturgical and teaching parts of in Didaches. it seems that the addition appeared at a later period in the writing of the literary work, so it is clear that the long title accompanies later additions to the original text. From another side, the long title resonates with the teaching of AI-Masih to the holy Apostles at the end of the Gospel of St. Matthew (28:19), \"Go make disciples of all nations.\" This analysis explains why the title appears later than the text of the Didache in its original form, which may not have known the existence of St. Matthew. Meanwhile, Riddle argues that the long title is the original title of the Didache, while the short title is a summary of what is often used to refer to the Didache, and has nothing to do with what appears in Acts (2:42) in terms of \"the Teachings of the Apostles.\" \", that is, \"They persevered in the teaching of the apostles, and they always gathered together to break bread and pray.\"",

The tendency to attribute the author to a Jewish Christian is not sufficient to pinpoint the place of writing, whether Alexandria, Antioch, Jerusalem, or some other place. Its agreement with the Epistle of Barnabas supports the suggestion that it was written in Egypt. For the closing prayer of the Eucharistic meal called the Didache, \"For thou hast power and glory forever and ever,\" contains only the words 'strength' and 'glory', and such a prayer was more popular in Egypt than anywhere else.

They say chapters 11-13 also affirm that the Didache was written in Syria, more specifically in West Syria, where Greek, the language used to write the Didache, was predominant. The reason is that the bad deeds mentioned in the 'two paths' section (Didache, 2:2 and 3:4) clearly point to a Hellenistic or Greek society (Didache, 4:1). Thus, first of all, the Didache was addressed to rural communities from among the heathen who converted to Christianity. Article 13 Didache also confirms this. However, it cannot be certain that the Didache originated in Antioch, or was written in the city of Antioch. This is because the customs that came from Paul and Luke - which were popular in Antioch - were customs that were different from the Didache. This confirms that he was not from Antioch. In addition, St. Ignatius of Antioch did not know the Didache, because he does not even quote the Didache in his letters, i.e. letters which show rules very different from the Didache.",

        "paragraph": "Adam, while proving that the Didache was of Syrian origin, said that the Coptic translation of the Didache was from a Syriac text which had been lost. He added that the Didache circulated and became popular quickly in Egypt as did many other literary works in the early Christian church, such as the Gospel of Luke, after the text of the Didache in its later form was altered to suit Coptic and Ethiopic translations. We can see this change clearly in chapter 9:4, \"Just as bread that was broken was spread on a mountain, then gathered together to become one, so will Your church be united from the ends of the earth to Your Kingdom.\" The pronunciation 'over the mountain' is an alteration and addition to the Didache's original text. Thus, the Didache became the object of controversy among scholars, some claiming it was written in Egypt, others claiming it was written in Syria. On top of this huge pile of studies, all we can do is read the text of the Didache carefully, to capture the beauty of the first church as a simple group bound by love, affection and harmony, both in Egypt and in Syria. While the opinion that the Didache was written in Palestine, rejected by people underlines the absence of Paul's teachings in the Didache. However, if it is true that the Didache was a work addressed to unbaptized people, then that would suffice to explain the absence of Paul's teachings in it. All attempts to establish the identity of the author of the Didache were unsuccessful, mainly due to the lack of data we have on this subject at present. The closest assumption to reality is that it was written by a Jewish Christian (Jewish Christian), or at least by a Christian from Judaism, because he mentions foods that are forbidden in the Old Testament, which has not changed until now except for the prohibition of food offerings for idols; And, because he denounced the hypocrisy of the Pharisees, it was as if he knew them and was acquainted with them.",

He also explained some of the activities of the first church founded by Christians who lived in the early second century AD, especially their worship procedures. For this reason, we cannot view this text as conclusive evidence of the faith of the church in general at that time, especially since the Didache soon disappeared from circulation. J.P Audet suggests that this author may be the same author as L.e Vademacum for one of the itinerant Apostles in the first church. 108] In any case, the itinerant Apostle has followed closely the teaching about the itinerant Apostles contained in the Didache chapter 11: 3-6. However, modern studies disagree with Audet's opinion. That the author of the Didache is more than one person, or more than one author who wrote the book in two periods: First, writing chapters 1: 1 to chapters 11: 2; Second, write chapters 11: 3 to 16: 8. The reason is that Didache chapters 11-13 could not have been written by the person who wrote chapters 14-15. As such, one cannot attribute all the articles of the Didache to one author. The first part of the Didache text - namely the part about morals - refers to a teacher who gives advice to his children or students. While chapter 4: 2 which states, \"Try every day to meet with the saints so that you are comforted by their words,\" shows the existence of a Christian congregation in which there are saints whose piety is popular among them. In addition to distinguishing between teachers who give advice and students who listen to them, this section also shows that there are Christian congregations that have been domiciled in one place for a long time, which allows for the emergence of generations of parents and generations of children.",

The church's liturgical functions have not been carried out by permanent church servants. That is what we see in chapter 15, where for the first time there appears the rank of bishops and deacons, who gradually occupy the position of Apostles, joyful messengers, and Prophets who move around and do not settle in one place; to undertake these tasks in the early period of church history. If the first part of the Didache is heavily influenced by Jewish teachings, then the terms 'bishop' and 'deacon' (article 15:1) emphasize that the congregation to which this literary work is sent are believers who previously did not know God, because if we find the term bishop and deacons during the apostolic period - without mentioning the term elders - then it shows we are dealing with a Christian congregation that was formed from non-Jewish nations or nations that do not know God. Thus, it is clear that the Didache was sent to Christian congregations that come from nations that do not know God. This does not preclude the possibility that chapters 7-16 hint at Jewish Christian writers, because it would be too much to say that the beginning of chapters 8:1 and 2 show a character that the Jewish Christian writer did not have. In addition, it is stated here that chapter 16 which explains the waiting for the Lord's coming for the second time among the congregation to which the Didache was sent, reveals the Jewish customs that had been standardized and ingrained in the first Christian church. In short, the Didache is a text that collects conflicting customs that are given a new formula at a certain time by an unknown author that is difficult for us to determine, but which has strong power over a group of Christian congregations that may come from among nations that do not know God.",

As already mentioned, this text has several sections of unequal length. Didache 16:2 states, \"Be of frequent assembly to study the things befitting your souls, for your faith in every age will avail you nothing, unless at the last hour you become perfect people.\" in accordance with the Epistle of Barnabas 4: 9 and 10, namely, \"Be on your guard in the last days.

According to the language, tauhid is the masculine form of the verb wahhada-yuwahhidu which means to make something into one. While Shaykh Muhammad bin Salih Al Utsaimin added that this meaning would be perfect if added the negation of everything other than what is made one. In the Islamic concept, monotheism is a concept in the Islamic faith that states the oneness of God. Islam teaches that God is one (one) not in terms of number. Except in the sense that God has no partner or similar. God is one in terms of his essence, meaning that there is no essence similar to God's essence. Because the Essence of God is not a thing and is not characterized by the properties of things, because it is God who created all things and all their properties. God already existed before this entire creation existed. God cannot be imagined because the imagination of the human mind can only reach things that are usually found, seen, heard, or felt with the five senses. And God is not similar to such things. Practicing monotheism and avoiding polytheism is a consequence of the shahadat sentence that has been pledged by a Muslim. In rububiyyah monotheism, Allah is recognized as the only Rabb (the One who rules), so that everything other than Allah is 'abd (servant/slave/dominated). Allah is the Almighty Rabb in the creation, management, and government of the universe. Allah as the only Creator is also the One who gives sustenance, the One who gives life, the One who kills, as well as the One who gives benefits and harm.

In uluhiyah monotheism, Allah is recognized as the One and Only God in all forms of worship from all His creatures. Acknowledging Allah as the only Lord has the consequence of the worship of the creatures to their Lord alone. Ibadah or self-servitude to God is the act of a creature to humble oneself to Him by doing His commandments and staying away from His prohibitions for a lifetime. Worship should not be directed at anything other than Allah. Worshiping other than Allah, even though worshiping Allah, is the greatest sin in Islam which is called shirk (associating with Allah), as mentioned in His word: Linguistically, tawhid means uniting, making one, or characterizing with unity. A Muslim believes that monotheism is the greatest principle of Islam and the greatest essence of Islam, and is one of the conditions for accepting good deeds in addition to being in accordance with the guidance of the Messenger of God. As for what is meant by conditions is anything that must be fulfilled before implementation and must reach the end of implementation. This is related to one's intention. If someone does something only for God, then the condition to be accepted is the intention because God must remain the same until the end.

If Satan does not succeed (into) great shirk, Satan will not despair to plunge into in polytheism in various wills and words (spoken by humans).

Compared to soap, detergent has the advantage of having better washing power and not being affected by water hardness. In general, detergents contain the following ingredients: Surfactants (surface active agents) are surface active agents that have different ends, namely hydrophilic (like water) and hydrophobic (like fat). This active ingredient functions to reduce the surface tension of water so that it can release dirt that sticks to the surface of the material. Basically, surfactants have ionic properties (electrical charge) and are categorized into three types of surfactants, namely: 1. Anionic Surfactants Anionic surfactants carry a negative charge so they react with positively charged ions in hard water. To note, hard water contains magnesium and calcium compounds. Anionic surfactants react with compounds in hard water to neutralize them. 2. Cationic surfactants Anionic surfactants carry a negative charge so they react with positively charged ions in hard water. To note, hard water contains magnesium and calcium compounds. Anionic surfactants react with compounds in hard water to neutralize them. 3. Nonionic Surfactants Because nonionic surfactants have no charge, they do not ionize in water. This type of surfactant helps clean oily stains through the emulsification process. Builder is a key component that can help optimize the way surfactants work. This booster or builder works to reduce calcium and magnesium ions so that the detergent can clean properly. Sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP) is an example of a widely used reinforcer. STTP is also able to maintain alkaline conditions when washing greasy dirt, is able to protect the washing machine from rust, and helps keep dirt in the washing water so it doesn't stick to clothes again.",

Bridges are built for crossing pedestrians, vehicles or trains over obstacles. Bridges are also part of the land transportation infrastructure which is very vital in traffic flows. Bridges are often a critical component of a road section, because it determines the maximum load of vehicles passing through the road. The first bridge was made with a wooden footbridge to cross the river. There are also people who use two ropes or rattan, which are tied to the rocks by the river. Henceforth, stone was still used, but only as a frame. The first arched bridges were built during the time of the Roman Empire, and there are still many Roman bridges and aqueducts that we know today. The Romans also had the knowledge to know the difference in the strength of different stones. The brick and mortar bridges were built during the time of the Roman emperors, because after that time, knowledge technology was lost. In the Middle Ages, the pillars of stone bridges were usually larger, causing difficulties for ships traveling on the river. In the 18th century, many reforms began in the construction of wooden bridges by Hans Ulrich, Johannes Grubenmann and others. With the advent of the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century, truss systems used iron to advance the technology of building larger bridges, but steel did not have sufficient tensile strength to support the large loads.",

So, often \"reinforced concrete\" (reinforced concrete) is used - the weak tensile strength of the concrete is filled by copper cables embedded in the concrete. The types of bridges can be categorized based on their use or support structure. A bridge is usually designed equally for trains, for road users or for pedestrians. There are also bridges built for large pipes and waterways that can be used to carry goods. Sometimes there are limitations in the use of bridges; for example, there are bridges that are dedicated to roads and cannot be used by pedestrians or cyclists. There are also bridges built for pedestrians (crossing bridges), and can be used for cyclists. Half the bridge is made higher than necessary, so that the reflection of the bridge will complete a circle. This kind of bridge, which is often found in oriental gardens, is called \"Bridge of the Moon\", because the bridge and its reflection resemble a full moon. Usually in the bridge palaces an artificial river is made as a symbol of the journey to an important place or event. There is a set of five bridges that cross a winding river in one of the important places in the Forbidden City in Beijing, China.

So, don't be surprised if the first bridge made was a tree that was deliberately uprooted across the river. Today, such bridges are only used temporarily, for example at logging sites, where roads are made only temporarily and then abandoned. This is because bridges like this have a short duration due to the trees touching the (wet) ground causing weathering, as well as attack by termites and other insects. A durable log bridge can be made using non-waterlogged and properly maintained concrete footings. Arch bridges have abutments at each end. Bridge loads are pushed to the abutments on both sides. The oldest arch bridges in the world were abandoned by the Greeks, including the Arkadiko Bridge. With a span of 220 meters, the Solkan Bridge over the So\u010da River in Solkan, Slovenia, is the second largest stone bridge in the world and the longest railway stone bridge. Completed in 1905.

This bridge is now rarely used except for short distances. This bridge is commonly used for pedestrian bridges and also bridges that cross the forest. If the beams are arranged in the form of a lattice, for example a triangle, so that each beam only supports part of the weight of the structure, then it is called a frame bridge. Compared to beam bridges, frame bridges are more economical in the use of materials. Frames can withstand heavier loads for longer distances using shorter elements than girder bridges. There are different types of ways to make this frame, however, they all use the principle of alternating tension and stress elements. If that one element had been known - through engineering analysis - to only experience tension without stress or sag, then it could have been made from a slimmer steel rod. The upper part of the frame is always under pressure, while the lower part is under tension. This bridge is always made by using two frames connected by horizontal corner elements to form a box-shaped structure. The road to be traveled can be built in some of the upper or lower elements, or it can also be suspended in the middle. If the bridge has to cross a very deep chasm, the frame can be balanced. This happens if the opposite bank makes development work more difficult. Frame bridges can be made from almost any hard and strong material, including timber, steel or reinforced concrete.

These materials can receive high pressure but cannot withstand strong tension. This bridge is in the shape of an arch - so any vertical pressure will also produce horizontal pressure at the top of the arch. In most arch bridges, the road is placed over the arch structure. The aqueducts of the ancient Romans used the rule of arranging several arch bridges - from long bridges to short bridges when height is added - to achieve height while maintaining the strength of the structure, by avoiding the construction of tall and slender vertical elements. This arch bridge is still used in canals and roads because it has an interesting shape, especially when crossing water because the reflection of the arch forms a circular and oval visual effect. Most modern stressed arch bridges are made of reinforced concrete. For its manufacture, temporary supports can be erected to support the shape of the bridge. When the concrete has hardened, then the temporary supports are dismantled. One of the variations of this type of bridge is when the arch of the bridge rises higher than the road. In this case, a copper cable connects the road with the arch. Suspension bridges were one of the first types of bridges, and are still made using native materials, such as straw ropes in some areas of South America. It is necessary that this bridge be renewed periodically because this material does not last long, and there, these materials are made by families as community contributions.

To walk on a bridge like this, by walking like sliding, because the usual way of walking will produce a moving wave that will cause the bridge and pedestrians to sway up-to-down or left-to-right. A modern suspension bridge capable of carrying vehicles uses two towers to replace trees. The cable that spans this bridge needs to be firmly moored at both ends of the bridge, because most of the load on the bridge will be borne by the tension in the main cable. The road section is connected to the main cable using a network of other cables that are suspended vertically. Bridges like this are only suitable for long distances, or it is not possible to erect support poles due to strong and dangerous currents. A bridge like this is also always a nice sight. This bridge is not suitable for use by trains because it will bend due to the load of the cars. A cable-stayed bridge is a bridge that uses several opposing cables that connect the road with the tower. These cables are tied taut and straight (does not bend except due to their own weight) to several different places along the road. The cables can be tied in the middle of the road (one net) or on the side of the road (two nets). Usually two towers are used, and the cables are arranged in a fan shape.

Support bridges are usually used to overcome construction problems when it is impracticable to support the bridge load from below during construction. Because it is rather hard / not easy to sway, it is suitable for use on railroads. Although from an artistic point of view the supporting structure only has one part, for bridges usually two similar parts (a pair) are made. One advantage of this bridge is that it can be built using only temporary caissons \u2013 this is done by constructing two sections at once to ensure the balance of the bridge. Most abutment bridges use a pair of similar structures, each with one tower and two protruding abutments. Then, when finished, the bridge would normally be anchored at the ends, to cause the supports to tip over, and to produce a wide gap between the two supports. After that, a road that had been built at the beginning of construction was lifted and placed in the middle of the bridge using cables to connect the two parts. If not, the middle of the road can be made right then and there with the parts. This support principle is commonly used in the manufacture of stressed gate bridges. In most modern long-distance bridge construction, temporary towers and cables are used to support the tiered sections of the gate. This method is somewhat the same as the construction of a cable-brace bridge. The use of temporary towers reduces the amount of material required and simplifies design. A movable bridge allows tall objects such as sailing ships to pass through it, or it can be used to traverse high distances or the distance can change.",

The Dajal is said to be infidel and evil, the bearer of the greatest slander (test) and there is no greater test than that. Then the prophets before the Prophet Muhammad also explained about Dajal to his people, only not as detailed as Muhammad's explanation, for example Dajal is a person who is blind in one eye. Lafazh ad-Dajjal is taken from the words of the Arabs (\u062f\u064e\u062c\u064e\u0644\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0639\u0650\u064a\u0652\u0631\u064e dajala al-ba\u2018\u012br), the meaning is to be painted over and covered with it. The original meaning of the word (\u0627\u0644\u062f\u064e\u0651\u062c\u064e\u0644\u064f) ad-Dajalu is to mix up, it is said \"\u062f\u064e\u062c\u064e\u0644\u064e \u0625\u0650\u0630\u064e\u0627 \u0644\u064e\u0628\u0650\u0633\u064e \u0648\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0648\u064e\u0651\u0647\u064e\" the meaning is to confuse and stir up. So, Dajjal is a person who confuses, is a liar and who is given something extraordinary. This word belongs to the form mubaalaghah (exaggeration) with wazan (\u0641\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0651\u0627\u0644\u064c), so the meaning is that there are many lies and confusion from them. The plural form is (\u062f\u064e\u062c\u064e\u0651\u0627\u0644\u064f\u0648\u0652\u0646\u064e), while Imam Malik pluralizes it with the word (\u062f\u064e\u062c\u064e\u0627\u062c\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0629\u064f), and is included in the jama' estimate. Then the word Dajjal became the Arabic vocabulary commonly used for the term \"false prophet\". However, the term Ad-Dajjal refers to the figure of the \"Immigrant\" or \"Liar\" who appears before the apocalypse. The term Al-Masih Ad-Dajjal (Arabic for \"False Messiah\") is a translation of the Syriac term Meshiha Deghala which had been in common vocabulary from the Middle East for more than 400 years before the Quran was revealed. This explanation was conveyed by Muhammad about the impending arrival of the Dajal and the prophets before Muhammad had warned his people of his arrival. Dajal according to the beliefs of the righteous Salafus is a child of Adam, he is not from the group of jinn. Two contemporary scholars say that Dajal is a child of Adam, he needs to eat, drink and so on, therefore he will and can be killed by Prophet Isa.",

He told about his experience of his voyage with thirty men from the Lakham and Judzam tribes, then they were stranded on an island. On the island they meet a bushy-haired creature who can talk, the creature claims to be named al-Jassasah. Then al-Jassasah ordered Tamim and his entourage to enter a monastery where there was a very well-built and large man, his hands were shackled to the nape of his neck, between his knees and his ankles were chained with iron. The island is said to be in the Syam Sea (Arabian Sea), then Muhammad explained to his companions in more detail that the Dajal would appear from the east. Dajal's exit is a sign of the great apocalypse that will soon arrive, which begins when the Muslims have great power and his release is to defeat this power. Before the Dajal comes out, humans are tested first with drought and hunger, as well as no rain and the destruction of trees for three consecutive years, livestock die. According to the explanation of the hadith that Dajal will appear from the east from the land of Persia, it is called Khurasan. Ibn Kathir said that the appearance of the Dajal was from Ashbahan (Isfahan) from an area called Judaiyah. The emergence of the new Dajal was clearly seen when he arrived somewhere between Iraq and Sham.

Dajal is described in the hadith as having advantages like the miracles of the prophets, this advantage is called istidraj, which is an ability or enjoyment given by Allah but used for disobedience. Dajal is able to revive the dead he kills, heal the blind, lepers, and will bring the dead back to life, bring forth fertility, bring rivers, heaven and hell, command the sky to rain then it rains, orders the earth to grow then plants grow .

As protection from the Dajal, Muslims can take refuge in the cities of Mecca and Medina, because the Dajal will never be able to enter these two cities, because these two cities are guarded by angels. When the Dajal has come out, Muslims are prohibited from approaching him, as much as possible to stay away from him, up to the mountains.

This name is especially known in the New Testament records of the Christian Bible as a Christian in the first century AD who had a significant contribution in maintaining the unity and integrity of the congregations that had existed in the early church. At a time when problems arose in the Christian congregation in the first century, and solving them required courage and obedience, one man who successfully faced more than one such challenge was Titus. As a fellow worker with the apostle Paul, he made a real effort to help others do things in the Christian way. Titus was indeed a co-worker the apostle Paul could rely on in helping to keep the Christian congregation clean in the first century. Hence, Paul told the Christians in Corinth that Titus was 'a fellow worker for them.' Titus was an uncircumcised Greek who later converted to Christ. Paul refers to him as \"the true son according to the faith shared,\" so Titus may have been one of the apostle's spiritual children. Titus accompanied Paul, Barnabas, and several other companions from Antioch, Syria when they went to Jerusalem in about 49 C.E. to discuss the question of circumcision. It has been suggested that because the conversion of uncircumcised \"heathens\" (in the sense of \"non-Jews\") was being discussed in Jerusalem, Titus was brought along to demonstrate that both Jews and Gentiles could gain God's approval regardless of their circumcision. or not. Some former Pharisees who after accepting Christianity became members of the congregation in Jerusalem argued that converts of Gentiles were required to be circumcised and observe the Jewish religious Law, but this argument was challenged.",

It is also tantamount to rejecting the evidence that Gentiles, or people from other nations, have received God's Holy Spirit. When the circumcision issue was resolved, Paul and Barnabas were given full authority to preach to the nations. At the same time, they and their colleagues, including Titus, also try to always pay attention to the poor. Titus is then mentioned in the inspired account some six years later, when he was in Corinth as Paul's messenger to organize a collection for the saints. However, when Titus did this work, he found himself in a tense situation. Paul's letter to the Corinthians reveals that it was first addressed to the Corinthians to \"cease mingling with fornicators.\" He must tell them to remove the fornicators from their midst. Yes, Paul wrote a strong letter to them, doing so \"with many tears.\" Meanwhile, Titus was sent to Corinth to help collect donations being made there for needy Judean Christians. Likely, he was also sent to observe the Corinthian response to Paul's letter. Anxious to find out, Paul may have sent Titus from Ephesus across the Aegean Sea to Corinth, with instructions to report back as soon as possible.

Paul could feel relieved and rejoiced at receiving the good news from Corinth. The congregation had handled the apostle's counsel well. Although Paul wondered what kind of welcome his envoy would receive, God helped Titus to fulfill his commission. Titus was received with \"fear and trembling\". In the words of commentator W. D. Thomas, \"we may presume that without weakening Paul's condemnation, Titus] argued skillfully and wisely before the Corinthians, convincing them that Paul, in delivering these words, had only their spiritual welfare in mind. \".

Their commendable attitude has been a source of encouragement to him. What about the other aspect of Titus' mission to Corinth \u2014 organizing the collection for the holy ones in Judea - Titus had been working on that as well, as can be deduced from information found in 2 Corinthians.

Certainly, Paul considered Titus up to the challenge from the \"very great apostles\" from Corinth. This impression of Titus is confirmed when he is again mentioned in the Bible, in another difficult assignment. Likely, sometime between 61 and 64 C.E., Paul wrote a letter to Titus, who was then serving on the Mediterranean island of Crete. Paul left him there to \"correct the things that were not good\" and to \"assign elders in city after city.\" In general, the Cretans were known as \"liars, harmful beasts, idle gluttons.\" Therefore, in Crete, Titus was again required to act with courage and determination. The task required a great deal of responsibility, for it could define Christianity on the island. Under inspiration, Paul helped Titus by detailing the criteria for prospective church overseers/elders. Even today, these requirements are still taken into consideration when appointing Christian elders. The Bible does not indicate when Titus left Crete. He was there long enough because Paul asked him to look after the needs of Zenas and Apollos, who stopped there on their way at an unspecified time. But Titus couldn't be there too long. Paul was to send Artemas or Tychicus there, and then Titus was expected to meet the apostle at Nicopolis, which was probably the leading city in northwestern Greece.",

Common units of weight for krugerrands are 1/10 oz (ounce), 1/4 oz, 1/2 oz and 1 oz. The price of the Krugerrand coin is based on the movement of gold prices on world commodity markets which move continuously throughout the trading period. Special Krugerrand coins (or so-called proof collector's edition) are also produced in limited quantities according to a certain theme. Due to limited production, often the price of the proof edition of the Krugerrand coin exceeds the price of the gold content of the coin depending on the rarity and condition of this particular coin. The edition that is quite popular and sought after by investors is the one that contains a picture of Nelson Mandela.

Today gold companies are raiding corners of the earth guided by a powerful guide: the World Bank. The World Bank, the main agency working to eradicate world poverty, thinks that multinational mining companies will bring investment, encouraging building roads, schools and jobs, to countries that have little capital other than their natural resources. The World Bank works on both sides. At his urging, more than 100 governments of financially troubled nations agreed to cut taxes and royalties to lure big mining companies, said James Otto, visiting professor at the University of Denver's law school. Meanwhile, the World Bank provided money for or guaranteed more than 30 gold mining projects, for profit. Although the mine is only a small part of the World Bank's portfolio, when accidents escalate controversy flares up. In one of the worst disasters, in 1995 a World Bank-insured mine in Guyana spilled more than 790,000 gallons of cyanide-laced mine waste into a tributary of the Essequibo River, which is the country's main water source. In 2001, the then president of the World Bank, James D. Wolfenshon, imposed a two-year moratorium on mining investment and ordered the preparation of a study into the World Bank's involvement in the industry. The potential for gold deposits is found in almost every region in Indonesia, such as on the island of Sumatra, the Riau Islands, Kalimantan Island, Java Island, Sulawesi Island, Nusa Tenggara, Maluku and Papua.",

Amalgam is still the simplest and cheapest gold extraction process, but it is an effective process for high grade gold ores having a coarse grain size (> 74 microns) and in forming free native gold. The amalgamation process is a chemical-physical process, when the amalgam is heated, it will decompose into elements, namely mercury and gold bullion. Amalgam can be decomposed by heating in a retort, the mercury will evaporate and can be recovered from the condensation of the mercury vapor. While Au-Ag remains in the retort as a metal. The cyanidation process consists of two important stages, namely the dissolving process and the process of separating the gold from the solution. The solvents commonly used in the cyanidation process are NaCN, KCN, Ca(CN)2, or a mixture of the three. The most commonly used solvent is NaCN, because it is able to dissolve gold better than other solvents. In general, the dissolution reaction of Au and Ag is as follows: 4Au + 8CN- + O2 + 2 H2O = 4Au(CN)2- + 4OH-4Ag + 8CN- + O2 + 2 H2O = 4Ag(CN)2- + 4OH- At The second stage is the separation of gold metal from the solution by precipitation using Zn powder (Zinc precipitation). The reaction that occurs is as follows: 2 Zn + 2 NaAu(CN)2 + 4 NaCN +2 H2O = 2 Au + 2 NaOH + 2 Na2Zn(CN)4 + H22 Zn + 2 NaAg(CN)2 + 4 NaCN +2 H2O = 2 Ag + 2 NaOH + 2 Na2Zn(CN)4 + H2 The use of Zn powder is an effective method for solutions containing small concentrations of gold.",

So actually not only Zn can crowd out Au and Ag, but Cu and Al can also be used, but because the price is more expensive it is better to use Zn. The process of extracting gold-silver from a rich solution using Zn powder is called the \"Merill Crowe Process\". Karat is a system of measuring the purity of gold. Gold purity is measured based on the percentage of pure gold contained in a metal. Gold is known as a rare metal and has unique properties. Its sparkling color is also perceived by people as very valuable in antiquity and used as a medium of exchange. Referring to its unique properties, gold metal which has a higher purity level will be softer the metal. Due to the nature of this metal which is too soft, it is rather difficult for craftsmen to maintain the durability of these items when used in their daily activities. Therefore gold must be mixed with other metals such as silver, copper and other metals to produce gold jewelry that has high durability in daily activities. In Indonesia, it is not yet clear how to determine and determine the relationship between karat and gold content. Almost every gold shop is different about this karat. Especially gold shops in different regions. For example, between Jakarta and Central Java there can be different interpretations of karat (gold purity).",

Grade is the level of authenticity of gold, or the amount of gold purity content. Gold content is expressed in \"carats\". 24 carat content is declared as pure gold. So 23-karat gold means the purity level is 23/24 X 100% or around 95.8%. So if the gold content is 22 carat and weighs 15 grams, then the pure gold content = 22/24 x 15 = 13.75 grams. To make it easier, there is already a setting available to determine carats based on their levels. According to SNI (Indonesian National Standard) - No. SNI 13-3487-2005 standard for carats is as follows: Carat Gold content: 22 carat gold should have a grade of around 90.6% to 94.79%. However, in practice this provision is not used. Often gold shops have their own provisions that do not refer to SNI. Gold with a content of 80% can be claimed as 22 carat gold. 20 carat gold in Indonesia may have the same gold content as 18 carat gold abroad. Therefore do not get hung up on rust. But pay attention to the level of gold content. If you want to buy gold, don't hesitate to ask what the level is in %%. Because actually the price benchmark is the content of gold content in jewelry. The higher the gold content in the jewelry, the higher the price. There are several ways that are commonly used to test the purity of gold.

For example in the form of necklaces, bracelets, rings, earrings, pendants, tiaras, and others. If you invest for the short term, you should not choose gold jewelry. This is because usually it will be difficult to make a profit. For every purchase of gold jewelry, in addition to being charged a gold price calculated based on weight and carats, you will also be charged the cost of processing gold into jewelry. When you resell the gold, the shop usually doesn't want to pay for the cost of making the jewelry. A fairly good gold investment is in the form of bars (bullion). In Indonesia, a fairly well-known gold bar is the Logam Mulia brand produced by PT Aneka Tambang (Antam) with a gold content of 99.99 percent. As a sign of authenticity, you will receive a gold certificate with a serial number attached to it, according to the serial number engraved on the gold bar. Unlike gold jewelry, gold bars are easier to resell. Several types of gold bars are commonly sold in gold shops in Indonesia: Gold coins are a type of gold in the form of coins.

Since the 17th century, the kingdom was ruled by the oba, far beyond the borders of present-day Benin, covering most of West Africa. This prosperous kingdom was an \"exporter\" of slaves and traded with the Portuguese and the Dutch. But chaos here eventually resulted in Dahomey being colonized by the French in 1892. In 1904, Dahomey became a part of French West Africa, no longer Dahomey. In 1958, Dahomey was granted autonomy, and full independence was achieved in 1960. A period of turbulence followed independence, and there were several coups and regime changes before Mathieu K\u00e9r\u00e9kou took power.

According to him, a good building must have firmitas (strength), utility (usability), and venustas (beauty). In the 19th century, Louis Sullivan made the statement \"form follows function\" which means \"form follows function\". This statement is often associated as a modern concept of architecture. The element of \"function\" here includes not only usability but also aesthetic, psychological, and cultural dimensions. The idea of \u200b\u200bsustainable architecture was introduced at the end of the 20th century. Over the years, the field of architectural construction has grown to encompass everything from ship design to interior decoration. Architecture is the art of Civil Engineering or the practice of designing and constructing structures and building construction. In a broader sense, architecture can include designing and constructing the entire macro-level built environment, for example urban planning, not just a single building and its appendages. Mangunwijaya and Wastu Citra (1995, p. 12) reveal that architecture comes from the Greek \"archee\" and \"tectoon\". Archee means the original, the first, the first.",

        "paragraph": "While Tectoon means sturdy, not collapsed or stable. Then archeetectoon means original and sturdy. From this etymology, we can conclude that architecture must meet at least two criteria, namely it must be unique or beautiful and strong. Talking about creativity, Vitruvius (31 BC \u2013 700 Mujarrod Rasulullah SAW), an old master architect in the book Ten Books of Architecture, said the same thing, that there are three criteria that must be met by a building, namely: Firmity (durability), Utility (function), Venustas (beauty). Architecture can mean: The importance of theory as a reference for practice cannot be overemphasized, although many architects ignore theory altogether. Vitruvius said: \"practice and theory are the roots of architecture. Practice is the ongoing contemplation of carrying out a project or doing it by hand, in the process of converting building materials in the best possible way. Theory is the result of reasoned thinking that explains the process of converting building materials into final results as an answer to a problem. An architect who practices without a theoretical basis cannot explain the reasons and basis for the forms he chooses. Meanwhile, an architect who has theorized without practice only adheres to \"shadows\" and not substance. An architect who adheres to theory and practice , he has a double weapon. He can prove the truth of the results of his design and can also make it happen in implementation\". This is all inseparable from the basic concept of thinking that the main strength of every Architect ideally lies in the power of ideas.

The Classical Age is generally considered to have started at the time of the writing of the oldest manuscript containing Homer's poems in Greek (7th to 8th century BC), then ended while Greco-Roman culture faded around 300-600 AD. Such a wide range of history and territory encompasses many unique civilizations and eras. The term \"Classical Age\" also refers to the grandiose vision of the people of later times of what is called the glory of Ancient Greece and the splendor of Ancient Rome. The culture of the Ancient Greeks as well as some elements of the culture of the Ancient Near East lay the benchmarks of perfection in the fields of art, philosophy, social order, and education in the Greco-Roman World until the Roman Empire. The Romans preserved, imitated, and spread these benchmarks of perfection throughout Europe until they were able to compete with Greek culture, that is, when the use of the Latin language had spread everywhere, and the Greco-Roman world was used to speaking in Greek as well as Latin. The foundation of Greco-Roman culture has a great influence on language, politics, law, education system, philosophy, science, warfare, poetry, historiography, ethics, rhetoric, art, and architecture of the Modern Age. Since 700 Mujarrod Rasulullah SAW, a revival movement has gradually grown on the remnants of the legacy of the Classical Age, which is a movement that will later be called the Renaissance in Europe. This movement reappeared when the neoclassical movements emerged in the 18th and 19th centuries. Classical Age architecture is architecture that grew and developed during the Classical Period. Classical Architecture is inherently (contained in the architectural building that associatively seems to always be attached to it) considered to have high quality and value, and contains the values \u200b\u200bof \"eternity\".",

The theory of Classical Architecture, thus, is an embodiment of architectural works which are based on and imbued with the ideas and ideals of Classical Architecture. To understand the Theory of Classical Architecture, we need to know the Order of the Classical Columns, especially the names of the parts, because it will be mentioned frequently, especially by Vitruvius in De Architectura. The growth of the Athenian Agora, initially, around 500 BC, is seen as the Panathenaic Route passing diagonally through the shapeless market-places and former government buildings that run along the foot of the ridge to the west of it. To the south is the Old Bouleuterion or Council House. And towards the North there are three small shrines. Around 420 BC, shows the development of an Agora soon after the construction of the Temple of Hephaisteion. A very powerful passage leads to this shrine, whose influence is felt as a guiding element. The New Bouleuterion with its semi-circular shape is built into the hillside behind the old building. The Zeus Stoa is located along a straight line following a horizontal line at the foot of the hill. The definition of the spatial boundaries of the Agora has yet to be formed. Some three centuries before the start of the Common Era, the Agora had matured itself in its development. Old Bouleuterion is confronted by Metroon along a horizontal baseline, in the form of a Colonade that complements the pre-existing Stoa of Zeus, to the North.

The borders of the territories in the East were the Euphrates and Tigris Rivers, and the Emperor was already in trade with the King of Kaniska in Northern India. The Forum that Traian built in Rome was larger than any of the earlier Forum buildings. The Forum in Roman cities, which can be equated with the Agora in Greek cities, was a central open space used as a gathering place, market, or for political meetings of the citizens of the city. Every Roman city had at least a Forum. Each new Roman emperor founded a Forum larger than the previous one for his own greatness. After experiencing changes and developments, the Forum is usually defined as a formal rectangular open space, equipped with a Colonade, decorated with statues and flanked by public buildings including the Basilica (assembly room or town hall - meeting hall), Curia (law courts - court room) , temples, municipal offices, tax buildings and shops. Near the Forum also placed Thermal (public bath). This thermal development of the Greek Gymnasium, has an important meaning in everyday social life, used for pleasure and relaxation. All cities, small ones have theaters and big ones have ampitheatres. The Roman Colosseum that still exists today is an impressive historical evidence of an Amphitheater that seats 50,000 people.

The next Roman emperor, Traian's heir, Hadrian (117-138 AD), put down the last Jewish rebellion, and built a new city, Aelia Capitolina, on the ruins of Jerusalem, with its Temple of the God Jupiter, and forbade all Jews from approaching the city. This caused a great uprising of the Jews, but was put down. After that, the Jews were resettled throughout Roman territory. Emperor Hadrianus was also an organizer, he improved the composition of civil servants by stipulating that each employee must be investigated first. Apart from that, employees receive sufficient salary and are given the right to be promoted. The composition of the staff became the basis for the composition of employees throughout Europe.

The architectural \"style\" developed in the form of a Classical order. Roman architecture was influenced by Greek architecture as they incorporated many Greek elements into their building practices. Texts on architecture have been written since ancient times. These texts provide general advice and specific formal canons or prescriptions. Several examples of canons are found in the writings of the Roman Architect of the 1st century BC, Vitruvius. Architecture developed in real space, existing in people's lives. As with other sciences, it always has conditions related to the dynamics of people's lives. This means that there is a mutual relationship between architecture and people's lives.

The air flow acts as passive cooling for the building structure and expels hot air which carries pollution and accelerates evaporation. Buildings that apply aerodynamic architecture have a cool effect in terms of physiology and psychology. The passive cooling process in aerodynamic architecture utilizes the principles of convection and the conduction of sunlight into other rooms or environments. Bioclimatic architecture is a type of architecture that performs building design based on the relationship between building form, environment and climate. The basic principle of bioclimatic architecture is the use of passive solar and bioclimatic designs that are energy efficient through the use of natural energy that comes from the environment around the building. Bioclimatic architecture prioritizes comfort conditions for occupants or building users. The bioclimatic concept in architecture was first introduced in 1950 by Olygay. The practical application of bioclimatic architecture only began to be used in 1963. In bioclimatic architecture, temperature and humidity are benchmarks in determining the comfort level of building usage. The development of the concept of bioclimatic architecture is the result of the energy crisis and climate change which makes people need architectural technology that is energy efficient and able to adapt to changing environmental conditions. Tropical architecture is a type of architecture that is suitable to be applied to environments that have a tropical climate.

In DNA, these bases form hydrogen bonds with their complementary pyrimidines thymine and cytosine. These are called complementary base pairs. In RNA, the complement of adenine is uracil (U) instead of thymine.

Apart from being the queen of the leaks, Rangda herself is considered the embodiment of Goddess Durga. According to its etymology, the word Rangda, which is known in Bali, comes from Old Javanese, namely from the word Randa, which means widow. Rangda is the title of a widow from the Tri Wangsa group, namely: While from the Sudra group it is called Balu and the word Balu in Balinese is Rangda. The further development of the term Rangda for widows is increasingly rare for us to hear, because it is feared it will give a bad impression considering that Rangda's form is 'aeng' (scary) and scary and is synonymous with people who have leftist knowledge (pengiwa). This is especially we get in folklore performances. In other words, there is an impression of fear, offense and embarrassment when it is said that one can neluh nerangjana (ngeleak). In fact, the meaning above is more inspired by folk tales in which there are elements of Rangda. The most influential story is Calonarang. It is said that most likely Rangda came from queen Mahendradatta who lived on the island of Java in the 11th century. He was exiled by king Dharmodayana because he was accused of committing witchcraft against the consorts of the two kings. According to legend he took revenge by killing half of the kingdom, which later belonged to him as well as to Dharmodayana's son, Erlangga. Then he was replaced by someone wise. The name Rangda also means widow. Rangda is very important to Balinese mythology. His battle against Barong or against Erlangga is often shown in ballets.",

Estimates of the habitable zone around other stars, sometimes referred to as the \"Goldilocks zone\" have coincided with the discovery of hundreds of exoplanets and new insights into extreme habitats. here on Earth, suggest that there may be more habitable places in the universe than was thought until recently. Current studies of the planet Mars by the Curiosity and Opportunity probes are underway to look for evidence of ancient life as well as plains associated with ancient rivers or lakes that may have inhabited it. The search for evidence of habitability, taphonomy (associated with fossils), and organic molecules on the planet Mars is now a major goal of NASA and ESA. Even if extraterrestrial life is never discovered, the interdisciplinary nature of astrobiology, and the cosmic and evolutionary perspectives it brings, could still yield a variety of benefits on Earth. The term was first proposed by the Russian (Soviet) astronomer Gavriil Tikhov in 1953. Astrobiology is etymologically derived from the Greek \u1f04\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd , astron, \"constellation, star\"; \u03b2\u03af\u03bf\u03c2 , bios, \"life\"; and -\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1, -logia, study. Synonyms of astrobiology vary; However, synonyms are structured in relation to the most important sciences implied in their development: astronomy and biology.

The term exobiology was coined by molecular biologist and Nobel Prize winner Joshua Lederberg. Exobiology is considered to have a limited scope limited to the search for life beyond Earth, whereas the subject area of \u200b\u200bastrobiology is broader and investigates the relationship between life and the universe, which includes the search for extraterrestrial life, but also includes research on life on Earth, its origins, evolution and limits.",

The term xenobiology is now used in a more specialized sense, meaning \"biology based on alien chemistry\", either of extraterrestrial or terrestrial (possibly synthetic) origin. Because alternative chemical analogues to some life processes have been created in laboratories, xenobiology is now considered a surviving subject. While astrobiology is an emerging and developing field, the question of whether life exists elsewhere in the universe is a verifiable hypothesis and thus a valid line of scientific inquiry. While once considered outside the mainstream of scientific inquiry, astrobiology has become a formal field of study. Planetary scientist David Grinspoon refers to astrobiology as a field of natural philosophy, which bases speculation on the unknown, on known scientific theories. NASA's interest in exobiology first began with the development of the US Space Program. In 1959, NASA funded its first exobiology project, and in 1960, NASA established the Exobiology Program, which is now one of the four major elements of NASA's current Astrobiology Program. In 1971, NASA funded an extraterrestrial intelligence search (SETI) search for radio frequencies of the electromagnetic spectrum for interstellar communications transmitted by extraterrestrial life outside the Solar System. NASA's Viking mission to Mars, launched in 1976, included three biological experiments designed to search for the metabolism of life now on Mars. Advances in astrobiology, observational astronomy, and the discovery of a large variety of extremophiles with the extraordinary ability to thrive in the harshest environments on Earth have led to speculation that life may develop on many extraterrestrial bodies in the universe.",

There is growing evidence to suggest that Mars previously had large amounts of water on its surface, water being considered an important precursor for the development of carbon-based life. The mission designed specifically to search for present-day life on Mars was the Viking program and the Beagle 2 probe. Viking's results were inconclusive and Beagle 2 failed minutes after landing. A future mission with a strong astrobiology role is the Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter which is designed to study Jupiter's frozen moons \u2014 some of which may have liquid water \u2014 should the mission not be aborted. In late 2008, the Phoenix lander investigated the environment for past and present microbial habitats on Mars, and researched the history of water there.

The five research topics are: 1) Origin and evolution of planetary systems 2) Origin of organic compounds in outer space 3) Rock-water-carbon interactions, organic synthesis on Earth, and steps leading to life 4) Life and habitability 5) Biological signatures to facilitate the detection of life. In November 2011, NASA launched the Mars Science Laboratory mission carrying the Curiosity rover, which landed on Mars in Gale Crater in August 2012.

Meanwhile, NASA is developing the Mars 2020 astrobiological rover and sample depository for later delivery back to Earth. When searching for life on other planets like Earth, a few simplifying assumptions are useful for reducing the size of the astrobiological task. One is the assumption that most life forms in our galaxy are based on carbon chemistry, as are all life forms on Earth. Carbon is famous for the incredibly wide variety of molecules that can be formed around it. Carbon is the fourth most abundant element in the universe and the energy needed to make or break bonds is just at the right level to build molecules that are not only stable, but also reactive. The fact that carbon atoms bond easily with other carbon atoms makes it possible to form very long and complex molecules. The presence of liquid water was an assumed requirement, as it is a common molecule and provides an excellent environment for the formation of complex carbon-based molecules that could eventually lead to the emergence of life. Some researchers posit mixed ammonia-water environments as possible solvents for various other types of hypothetical biochemistry. The third assumption is to focus on planets orbiting stars like the Sun to increase the likelihood of planetary habitability. Very massive stars have relatively short lifetimes, meaning that life may not have time to emerge on planets orbiting them. Very small stars give off so little heat and warmth that only planets in very close orbits around them would not freeze and in such close orbits and these planets would \"lock in\" to the star.",

This is important, because red dwarfs are the most numerous stars in the universe. (See Habitability of red dwarf systems). Since Earth is the only planet known to harbor life, there is no clear way of knowing whether this simplification assumption is true or false. Research on communication with extraterrestrial intelligence (CETI) focuses on crafting and deciphering messages that can theoretically be understood by other technological civilizations. Communication efforts by humans include broadcast mathematical languages, pictorial systems such as the Arecibo message and computational approaches to detecting and deciphering 'natural' language communication. The SETI program, for example, uses radio telescopes and optical telescopes to search for intentional signals from extraterrestrial intelligence. While some well-known scientists such as Carl Sagan have advocated sending messages into outer space, scientist Stephen Hawking warns against it, arguing that aliens may attack Earth solely for its resources and then leave. Most astrobiology research related to astronomy falls into the category of exoplanet detection, the hypothesis being that if life arose on Earth, it could also arise on other planets with similar characteristics. To that end, a number of instruments designed to detect Earth-sized exoplanets have been considered, most notably NASA's Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF) and ESA's Darwin program, both of which have been cancelled. NASA launched the Kepler mission in March 2009, and the French Space Agency launched the COROT space mission in 2006. There are also several less ambitious ground-based efforts underway. The goal of this mission is not only to detect Earth-sized planets, but also to directly detect the light from these planets so that they can be studied spectroscopically.",

It is hoped that once these missions come online, their spectra can be cross-checked with that of this virtual planet for features that might indicate the presence of life. An estimate for the number of planets with intelligent communicative extraterrestrial life can be obtained from the Drake equation, essentially an equation that expresses the probability of intelligent life as the product of factors such as the fraction of potentially habitable planets and the fraction of planets on which life is likely to arise: N= R\u2217\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0fp\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0ne\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0fl\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0fi\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0fc\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0L{\\displaystyle N=R^{*}~\\times ~f_{p}~\\times ~n_{e}~\\times ~f_{l}~\\ times ~f_{i}~\\times ~f_{c}~\\times ~L} With: However, while the reasoning behind the equation is convincing, it is unlikely that it will have a reasonable margin of error any time soon. The problem with the formula is that it cannot be used to generate or support a hypothesis because it contains factors that can never be verified. The first variable, R*, the number of stars, is generally limited to a scale of a few magnitude levels (10n). The second and third variables, fp, star with planets and fe, planet with habitable conditions, are being evaluated for systems around these star systems. Drake originally formulated the equation simply as an item on the agenda for discussion at the Green Bank conference, but some applications of the formula have been taken literally and related to simplistic scientific or pseudoscientific arguments.

It has been suggested that peculiarities of the Solar System (eg, the presence of Jupiter as a protective shield) may have greatly increased the likelihood of intelligent life emerging on our planet. Biology cannot state that a process or phenomenon, by being mathematically possible, must exist forcibly on a celestial object. Biologists define what is speculative and what is not. The discovery of extremophiles, organisms capable of surviving extreme environments, is a core research element for astrobiologists, because such organisms are important for understanding the four frontiers of life on a planetary scale: potential panspermia, forward contamination due to human exploration efforts, human colonization of the planet. , and the exploration of extinct and extant extraterrestrial life. Until the 1970s, life was thought to depend entirely on energy from the Sun. Plants on Earth's surface capture energy from sunlight to photosynthesize sugars from carbon dioxide and water, releasing oxygen in the process which is then consumed by oxygen-responding organisms, passing their energy up the food chain. Even life in the depths of the oceans, where sunlight cannot reach, is thought to obtain its food either from consuming organic detritus that rains down from the surface of the water or from eating animals that do. A planet's ability to support life is thought to depend on its access to sunlight. However, in 1977, during exploratory dives into the Galapagos Rift at the Alvin underwater probe, scientists discovered colonies of giant tubeworms, clams, crustaceans, clams, and various other creatures swarming around underwater volcanic features known as hydrothermal vents. These creatures thrived despite having no access to sunlight, and it was soon discovered that they comprised an entirely independent ecosystem.",

Other life forms that are completely decoupled from energy from sunlight are the green sulfur bacteria which capture geothermal light for anoxyogenic photosynthesis or the bacteria which carry out chemolithoautotrophy based on the radioactive decay of uranium. This chemosynthesis revolutionized the study of biology and astrobiology by revealing that life does not have to depend on the sun, it only needs water and an energy gradient to exist. Biologists have found extremophiles thriving in ice, boiling water, acids, alkalis, nuclear reactor water cores, salt crystals, toxic wastes and in a variety of other extreme habitats previously thought to be inhospitable to life. It breaks new ground in astrobiology by greatly expanding the number of possible extraterrestrial habitats. The characteristics of these organisms, their environment and evolutionary pathways, are considered important components for understanding how life could have evolved elsewhere in the universe. For example, some organisms that are able to withstand exposure to a vacuum and outdoor radiation include the lichen fungi Rhizocarpon geographicum and Xanthoria elegans, the bacteria Bacillus sapensis, Deinococcus radiodurans, Bacillus subtilis, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana (mouse ear watercress), as well as Tardigrada invertebrate animals. While tardigrades are not considered to be truly extremophiles, they are considered extrotolerant microorganisms that have contributed to the field of astrobiology.

The origin of life, known as abiogenesis, as distinct from the evolution of life, is another ongoing area of \u200b\u200bresearch. Oparin and Haldane postulated that conditions on early Earth were conducive to the formation of organic compounds from inorganic elements and thus to the formation of many of the chemicals common to all forms of life that we see today. The study of this process, known as prebiotic chemistry, has made some progress, but it remains unclear whether life could have formed in this way on Earth. An alternative hypothesis of panspermia is that the first elements of life may have formed on other planets with more favorable conditions (or even in interstellar space, asteroids, etc.) and then been brought to Earth - the panspermia hypothesis. The cosmic dust that pervades the universe contains complex organic compounds (\"amorphous organic solids with mixed aromatic-aliphatic structures\") that can be made naturally, and rapidly by stars. Furthermore, one scientist suggested that these compounds might be related to the development of life on Earth and said that, \"If this is the case, life on Earth might be easier to start because these organic materials could serve as the basic building blocks for life.\" More than 20% of the carbon in the universe can be associated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), a possible starting material for the formation of life.

On a larger scale, astroecology concerns the resources for life about stars in galaxies through the cosmological future. Astroecology seeks to measure future life in space, addressing this area of \u200b\u200bastrobiology. Experimental astroecology investigates the soil resources of a planet, based on extraterrestrial materials found in meteorites. The results showed that Mars chondrite materials and carbon could support the cultivation of bacteria, algae and plants (asparagus, potatoes), with high soil fertility. These results support the argument that life can survive on watery asteroids and on similar materials imported to Earth via dust, comets and meteorites, and that such asteroid material could be used as soil for future space colonies. On the largest scale, cosmoecology concerns life in the universe during cosmological epochs. The main sources of energy are probably red giant stars and white and red dwarfs, which sustain life for up to 1020 years. Astroecologists suggest that their mathematical model can measure the amount of potential future life in space, enabling an expansion of biodiversity that could potentially lead to a wider variety of intelligent life forms.

By examining the fossil evidence, paleontologists can better understand the types of organisms that arose on the ancient Earth. Some regions on Earth, such as the Pilbara in Western Australia and Antarctica's McMurdo Dry Valleys, are also thought to be analogous to geological regions on Mars, and as such, may provide clues as to how to look for past life on Mars. A variety of organic functional groups, consisting of hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and a number of metals, such as iron, magnesium, and zinc, provide for the wide variety of chemical reactions catalyzed by living organisms. In contrast, silicon interacts with only a few other atoms, and large silicon molecules are monotone compared to the combinatorial universe of organic macromolecules. Indeed, it appears that in general terms the basis of life elsewhere would be similar to that on Earth, if not in detail. Although terrestrial life and life that might have arisen independently of Earth are expected to share many similar\u2014if not identical\u2014foundations of life, they are also expected to possess some unique biochemical qualities.

The four most likely candidates for life in the Solar System are the planet Mars, the Jovian moon Europa, and Saturn's satellites Titan and Enceladus. Mars, Enceladus and Europa are considered potential candidates in the search for life primarily because they may have underground liquid water, a molecule essential to life as we know it for its use as a solvent in cells. Water on Mars has been found frozen in its polar ice caps, and newly carved trenches recently observed on Mars suggest that liquid water may exist, at least temporarily, on the planet's surface. At the low temperatures and low pressures on Mars, liquid water tends to be very salty. As for Europa and Enceladus, huge global oceans of liquid water exist beneath the icy outer layers of these moons.

The tribe was later driven out by the Caribbean Indians in the early 14th century. In the early 15th century Spanish conquistadors arrived in Barbados and had taken the Caribbean tribes as slaves. As a result, the rest of these clans have moved to adjacent islands. Portuguese explorer Pedro a Campos had stopped on this island in 1536 during his journey to Brazil. He had named this island Los Barbados ('those who bear the beard'), probably after seeing the island's 'fig' tree, which had long hanging roots hanging down like a beard. Barbados was uninhabited when the English came to settle in 1627. Captain John Powell landed on Barbados in 1625 and declared this deserted island a British colony. Two years later, his brother Captain Henry Powell landed with 80 sailors and 10 slaves. The group had founded the first European settlement at Jamestown, on the West coast and now known as Holetown. By the end of 1628 the population of the colony had grown to 2,000 people. After a few years, colonists have cleared a lot of wilderness and planted tobacco and cotton. In the 1640s they replanted these fields with sugarcane.",

Due to the high demand for sugar, the slaves were brought from the African continent and worked in the existing sugar plantations until 1834 when the slavery system was abolished. But the economy of Barbados still depends on sugar, \"rum\" and \"molasses\" until the 20th century. In 1639, the settlers on this island formed a Legislative Assembly, which was the second parliament established in the British colony after Bermuda. All this time the people of Barbados were loyal to the King and after King Charles I was beheaded in 1649, Oliver Cromwell, the Prime Minister of Great Britain sent his army to Barbados to get their recognition. His army arrived in 1651 and a year later the 'Articles of Capitulation' were signed, which were the basis of the \"Charter of Barbados\". This charter guarantees the government of Barbados headed by a governor, independent representation, and freedom from taxation without local authority. When the King system was restored in 1660, this Charter gave more freedom to the people here. Racial discrimination is rampant on this island. Although the slavery system was abolished in 1834, there were still many slaves who were more comfortable living on the plantations. Blacks who refused to be slaves, were forced to live in wild settlements. When the economy fell (known as (The Great Depression) in the 1930s, unemployment increased, and living conditions became more and more acute until chaos broke out in these islands. To overcome political instability, the British had to give in to the black reformers and involve them into the country's political process. One of them was Grantley Adams, who 1 decade later was appointed as the first Prime Minister.",

However, executive power still lies in the hands of the Prime Minister and his Cabinet. The Prime Minister is usually the head of the political party that won the election for the \"House of Assembly\" or People's Council which has 30 seats. Its members are elected every 5 years. There are 21 members of the Senate or State Council and are appointed by the Governor-General. Of these, 12 members are appointed on the advice of the Prime Minister, 2 on the advice of the Leader of the Opposition and 7 are elected by the Governor-General.

Thomas Aquinas argued that \"they give more pleasure (than fish), and much nourishment to the body, so that eating them gives more advantages to the seminal processes, which when in excess give encouragement to the passions.\" However, dispensations for dairy materials were awarded as donations for the construction of a number of churches, including the \"Butter Tower\" in Rouen Cathedral.

Two Russo-Swedish wars in 25 years made Finns realize how dangerous their position was between Sweden and Russia. Elite voices in Finland later argued that relations with Sweden were very risky, after Gustav III's War (1788\u20131790), Finnish elites wanted to separate from Sweden. By the late 18th century, the political elite in Finland had realized that Russia and Sweden were repeatedly using Finland as a fighting ground. Therefore, they seek autonomy. Some, even before the Russo-Swedish War 1788\u20131790, notably Col G. M. Sprengtporten, supported Gustav III's 1772 coup. On 29 March 1809, after being taken over by the armies of Alexander I of Russia in the Finnish War, Finland became an autonomous Grand Duchy of the Russian Empire until the end of 1917. In 1811, Alexander I annexed the province of Vyborg to the Grand Duchy of Finland. In the Russian era, Finnish began to gain a place.",

Among its accomplishments were the publication of the national epic in Finland\u00a0\u2013Kalevala\u00a0\u2013 in 1835, and the Finnish language gaining legal status with Sweden in 1892. The Finnish famine of 1866\u20131868 killed 15% of the population, making it one of the worst famines in European history. This famine prompted the Russian Empire to ease financial regulation and increase investment in the previous decades. Economic and political development is very fast. GDP per capita is still half the United States and a third the United Kingdom. In 1906, general suffrage was adopted in the Grand Duchy of Finland. However, relations between the Grand Duchy and the Russian Empire soured when the Russian government tried to tighten Finland's autonomy. For example, this general suffrage means nothing in practice because the emperor is not obliged to approve any law adopted by the Finnish parliament. Thus the desire for independence increased, first among radical liberals and socialists. After the February Revolution of 1917, Finland's position as part of the Russian Empire was questioned, particularly by the Social Democrats. Since the head of state was the Russian tsar, it is unclear who was the chief executive of Finland after the revolution. Its parliament, controlled by social democrats, passed the Power Act policy to give parliament supreme authority. This was rejected by Russia's Provisional Government which then dissolved parliament. General elections were then held, in which the right-wing party narrowly won. Some members of the Social Democrats rejected the results and still claimed that dissolving parliament was illegal. The two equally powerful political blocs (right-wing parties and social democrats) became enemies with each other. The October Revolution in Russia changed many things. Suddenly, right-wing parties reconsidered their decision to block the transfer of supreme executive power from the Russian government to Finland, as the Bolsheviks took power in Russia.",

About 70% of workers are in the agricultural sector and 10% in the industrial sector. The largest export markets are the United Kingdom and Germany. During World War II, Finland fought the Soviet Union twice: first in the Winter War between 1939\u20131940 after the Soviet Union attacked Finland and the Continuation War in 1941\u20131944, after Operation Barbarossa in which Finland was united with Germany (although not as an ally). For 872 days, the German army laid siege to Leningrad, the second largest city of the Soviet Union, aided indirectly by the Finnish army. After fighting off a major Soviet offensive in June/July 1944, Finland finally reached an armistice with the Soviet Union. This was followed again by the Lapland War of 1944-1945, in which the Finnish army succeeded in expelling the German army from the north. The country was forced to sign the Finnish\u2013Soviet agreement i.e. Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Benefit, also known as the YYA Agreement in 1948. This agreement with the Soviet Union included obligations, boundaries and concessions to Finnish territory in addition to the 1940 Moscow Peace Treaty. This agreement is important to ensure Finland's survival as a democratic capitalist country. Basically in this agreement, Finland was obliged to become a neutral country during the Cold War and to prevent any attack on the Soviet Union through Finland. As a result of these 2 wars, Finland ceded almost all of Karelia, Salla and Petsamo to the Soviet Union.",

Finland rejected the Marshall Plan, out of respect for the Soviets. Even so, the United States provided covert development assistance and assisted the Social Democratic (non-communist) party in hopes of protecting Finland's independence. Conducting trade with Western countries, such as Britain and paying for improvements to the Soviet Union made this country transform from a country that was originally based on an agrarian economy into an industrial country. For example, the company Valmet was originally created to make materials for war repairs, but after the repairs paid off, Finland (which was poor in natural resources such as oil and iron) \u2013 was finally able to resume trading with the Soviet Union in the form of bilateral trade. In 1950, 46% of Finnish workers worked in agriculture and one third lived in urban areas. New jobs in manufacturing, services, and trade quickly drew residents to cities. The average births per woman fell from a peak of 3.5 in 1947 to 1.5 in 1973. As a population boom entered the workforce, the economy was not producing enough jobs, and thousands of people migrated to more affluent Sweden. Emigration reached its peak in 1969-1970.

In politics, there is a tendency to avoid any policies and statements that could be construed as \"anti-Soviet\". This phenomenon was referred to as \"Finlandization\" by the German press. Despite maintaining good relations with the Soviet Union, Finland was still a Western European market economy. Various industries benefited from bilateral trade with the Soviets, which also explains the support for pro-Soviet policies in business in this country. Economic growth skyrocketed after the war, and by 1975 the country's GDP per capita was ranked 15th in the world. Finland negotiated the European Economic Community (the predecessor to the European Union), a treaty that eliminated customs duties between countries starting in 1977, although Finland did not fully join. In 1981, worsening health conditions forced president Urho Kekkonen to retire after 25 years in power. Finland reacted warily to the collapse of the Soviet Union, but quickly integrated itself into the West. On September 21, 1990, Finland unilaterally declared the Paris Peace Agreement obsolete, 9 days after German reunification. Faulty macroeconomic calculations, a banking crisis, the collapse of its single largest trading partner (the Soviet Union), and a global economic downturn sent the country falling into recession in the early 1990s. The recession peaked in 1993, but 10 years later the country's economy is growing every year. Like other Nordic countries, Finland decentralized its economy since the late 1980s. Financial policies and product markets were relaxed. Several state companies were privatized and tax cuts were also applied. Finland joined the European Union in 1995, and the Eurozone in 1999.

Liquid water is the densest liquid, with a density of 1 g/cm3 at 4 \u00b0C and becomes less dense as the water molecules begin to form hexagonal ice crystals when the freezing point is reached. This is because hydrogen bonds predominate intermolecular forces, which results in less dense packing of molecules in a solid. The density of ice increases slightly with decreasing temperature and has a value of 0.9340 g/cm3 at -180\u00b0C (93 K).",

Emerald is a beryl silicate mineral (contains beryllium) and its green color is caused by chromium traces. The presence of vanadium and iron that accompanies chromium traces will cause the various zones of the green color. Emerald has a high hardness (7.5 on the Mohs scale). Producers of high quality emeralds are Colombia, Siberia, South Africa, Zimbabwe and Brazil. Currently, the emerald mine in Russia (Siberia) has been closed due to the lack of deposits in it. Stone mining in Brazil and Colombia is still ongoing, where more than 60% of emeralds sold in the market come from Colombia. Not all emeralds that come from Colombia are of high quality, some are of low quality. This low quality stone often has many defects in the form of cracks or cracks in it. To beautify the appearance of these deformed emeralds, traders usually provide treatment oiling. The presence of oil (oil) that covers the cracks in the emerald stone will make the defects invisible to the naked eye. But if the oil evaporates or is washed away by water, the crack will appear again. This oil treatment is called CE (Clarity Enhancement). There are 3 levels, namely Major, Moderate and Minor. Emeralds that have many defects fall into the Major category. Usually if it is not often given oil, then the stone will quickly turn into many cracks. Emerald stones treated with this oil need to be cared for properly so that they maintain their beauty. Continuous exposure to sunlight, rinsing water and soap can make the oil inside the emerald come out so that the defects in the stone will be visible again.",

Lymphocytes primarily play a role in adaptive immunity. Lymphocytes are generally divided into B lymphocytes (B cells), T lymphocytes (T cells), and natural killer cells (NK cells, natural killer). B cells are so named because they develop in the Bursa Fabricus (in birds) or in the bone marrow (in humans). While T cells are so named because they develop in the thymus. B cells play a role in humoral immunity (involving antibodies), while T cells play a role in cell mediated immunity (cell mediated immunity). The function of T cells and B cells is to recognize specific \"non-self\" antigens during a process known as antigen presentation. Once the cells have identified the invader, they generate a specific response that is adapted to eliminate the particular pathogen or infected cells. B cells respond to pathogens by producing large amounts of antibodies which then neutralize foreign bodies such as bacteria and viruses. A subset of T cells, called helper T cells (Th cells), produce cytokines that direct the immune response, while another T cell, called cytotoxic T cells (Tc cells), produce toxic granules containing enzymes that induce the death of target cells. Upon activation, B cells and T cells leave memory cells, which \"remember\" any specific pathogen encountered, and are able to mount a strong and rapid response if the pathogen is detected again. NK cells are part of the innate immune system and play a major role in host protection from tumor and virus-infected cells. NK cells differentiate infected and tumor cells from normal and uninfected cells by recognizing changes from surface molecules called MHC class I. NK cells are activated in response to a family of cytokines called interferons.",

Ability is a current assessment of what a person can do. Intellectual ability is the ability needed to perform various mental activities - thinking, reasoning, and solving problems. Individuals in most societies place a high value on intelligence, and for good reasons. Intelligent individuals are also more likely to become leaders in a group. The seven most frequently mentioned dimensions constituting intellectual ability are: Physical ability is the ability to perform tasks demanding stamina, dexterity, strength, and similar characteristics. Research on the requirements of hundreds of jobs has identified nine basic abilities involved in the performance of physical tasks. Each individual has different basic abilities. The specific intellectual or physical abilities needed to do a job adequately depend on the ability and job requirements. For example, airplane pilots need strong spatial visualization skills; lifeguards need strong spatial visualization skills and good body coordination; senior executives need verbal skills; and tall construction workers need balance. Biographical characteristics are individual characteristics - such as age, gender, race, and tenure - that are obtained easily and objectively from a person's personal file. The relationship between age and job performance is likely to become a more important issue over the coming decades due to the widespread belief that job performance declines with age; the fact that the workforce is aging; and legislation, especially in the US, prohibiting retirement orders. Evidence suggests that the best place to start is with the recognition that there are few, if any, important differences between men and women that affect their performance.",

Chemically, indium is similar to gallium and thallium, and most of its properties fall between gallium and thallium. Indium was discovered in 1863 by Ferdinand Reich and Hieronym Theodor Richter by spectroscopic method. They named it after the indigo line in its spectrum. Indium was isolated the following year. Indium is a minor component in zinc sulfide ores and is produced as a by-product of zinc refining. The metal is used primarily in the semiconductor industry, in low melting point alloys such as solder, in high pressure vacuum sealers, and in the production of transparent indium tin oxide (ITO) conductive coatings on glass. Indium has no biological role, although its compounds are mildly toxic when injected into the bloodstream. Most of the occupational exposure is through ingestion, which absorbs indium compounds less well, and inhalation, which absorbs quite well. Indium is a very ductile silvery-white post-transition metal with a bright luster. It is very soft (Mohs hardness 1.2) like sodium, and can be cut with a knife. It also leaves visible lines on the paper. It is a member of group 13 on the periodic table and its properties lie mostly between that of its vertical neighbours, gallium and thallium.

Its boiling point is 2072\u00b0C (3762\u00b0F), higher than that of thallium, but lower than that of gallium, in contrast to the general melting point trend, but decreasing trend with that of the other post-transition metal groups due to the weak metallic bond with few delocalized electrons. The density of indium is 7.31 g/cm3, greater than that of gallium, but lower than that of thallium. Below the critical temperature, 3.41 K, indium becomes a superconductor. At standard temperature and pressure, indium crystallizes in a face-centered tetragonal crystal system in the I4/mmm space group (lattice parameters: a = 325 pm, c = 495 pm): this is a slightly distorted en:face-centered cubic structure, where each indium atom has four neighbors at a distance of 324 pm and eight neighbors slightly further away (336 pm). Indium displays a ductile viscoplastic response, which is found to be size independent of tension and compression.

Indium is the most abundant element in the Earth's crust at approximately 160 ppb, about as abundant as cadmium. Fewer than 10 indium minerals are known and none of these significant deposits. Two of them are dzhalindite (In(OH)) and indit (FeIn). Indium tends to coexist with zinc in sulfide minerals because the two elements have similar atomic radii and chemical properties. Based on the indium content of zinc ores, the total economically viable reserves of indium are about 6,000 tons, and the Royal Society of Chemistry warned of the serious risk that indium supplies could run out within a century.",

The limitations of indium mineral deposits and the fact that indium is abundant in the sulfide deposits of lead, tin, copper, iron, and especially zinc, have made zinc and lead production the main source of indium. Indium is leached from the slag and dust of zinc production. Further purification is carried out by means of electrolysis. The exact process varies according to the exact composition of the slag and dust. The main production of indium comes from residues generated during the processing of zinc ores, but it is also found in iron, lead, and copper ores.

According to forecasts, indium supplies remain for less than 14 years, at current extraction rates, requiring additional recycling. In 1924, indium was discovered to have the valuable property of stabilizing non-ferrous metals, and this became the element's first significant use. The first large-scale application of indium was for coating bearings in high-performance aircraft engines during World War II, to protect against damage and corrosion; however this is no longer the primary use of the element. New uses have been found in fusible alloys, solders, and electronics. In the 1950s, small indium grains were used for the transmitter and collector of PNP bipolar junction transistors. In the mid and late 1980s, the development of indium phosphide semiconductors and indium tin oxide thin films for liquid crystal displays (LCDs) generated a great deal of interest. By 1992, thin film applications had become the largest end use. Indium(III) oxide and indium tin oxide (ITO) are used as transparent conductive coatings on glass substrates in electroluminescent panels. Indium tin oxide is used as a light filter in low pressure sodium vapor lamps. Infrared radiation is reflected back to the lamp, which increases the temperature inside the tube and improves lamp performance. Indium has many applications related to semiconductors.

It is the lightest of the halogens and occurs under standard conditions as a pale yellow, highly toxic diatomic gas. As the most electronegative element, it is highly reactive, as it reacts with all other elements except argon, neon and helium. Among all the elements, fluorine ranks 24th in universal abundance and 13th in terrestrial abundance. Fluorite, the principal mineral source of the fluorine which gives the element its name, was first described in 1529; because it was added to metal ores to lower their melting point in order to make smelting easier, the Latin verb fluo meaning 'to flow' gave the mineral its name. Proposed as an element in 1810, fluorine proved difficult and dangerous to separate from its compounds, and several early researchers died or suffered injuries as a result of their experiments. It wasn't until 1886 that the French chemist Henri Moissan isolated elemental fluorine using low-temperature electrolysis, a process still used for modern production. Industrial production of fluorine gas for uranium enrichment, its greatest application, began during the Manhattan Project in World War II. Due to the high cost of purifying pure fluorine, most commercial applications use fluorine compounds, with about half of the fluorite mined being used in steelmaking. The remaining fluorite is converted to corrosive hydrogen fluoride on its way to various organic fluorides, or to cryolite, which plays a key role in aluminum refining. Molecules containing carbon\u2013fluorine bonds often have very high chemical and thermal stability; their main uses are as refrigerants, insulating electrical and cookware, and PTFE (Teflon).",

Organofluorine compounds often persist in the environment because of the strength of the carbon\u2013fluorine bond. has no known metabolic role in mammals; some plants and sea sponges synthesize organofluorine toxins (most commonly monofluoroacetate) that help prevent predation. The fluorine atom has nine electrons, one fewer than neon, and the electron configuration is 1s22s22p5: two electrons in the inner shell that are filled and seven in the outer shell that require one more to be filled. The outer electrons are ineffective in shielding the core, and experience a high effective nuclear charge of 9 \u2212 2 = 7; this affects the physical properties of the fluorine atom. The first ionization energy of fluorine is the third highest of all the elements, behind helium and neon, which complicates the removal of electrons from the neutral fluorine atom. It also has a high electron affinity, second only to chlorine, and tends to gain electrons to be isoelectronic with the noble gases neon; it has the highest electronegativity of any element. The fluorine atom has a small covalent radius, about 60 picometers, similar to that of its neighbors in the same period, oxygen and neon. note 1] The bond energy of difluorine is much lower than that of Cl2 or Br2 and is similar to that of a peroxide bond that is easily cleaved; this, together with high electronegativity, leads to easy fluorine dissociation, high reactivity, and strong bonding with nonfluorine atoms.",

Alkali metals will cause explosions and alkaline earth metals show strong activity in large quantities; to prevent passivation from forming a metal fluoride layer, most other metals such as aluminum and iron must be powdered, and the precious metal requires pure fluorine gas at 300\u2013450 \u00b0C (575\u2013850 \u00b0F).

Approximately 4.5 million tonnes of ore and US$550 million in revenue were generated in 2003; a subsequent report estimated 2011 global fluorochemical sales of $15 billion and estimated production figures of 3.5 to 5.9 million tons, and revenues of at least $20 billion. Float separates the mined fluorite into two main metallurgical grades in equal proportions: 60\u201385% pure metspar is almost all used in iron smelting while 97%+ pure acid is mostly converted to hydrogen fluoride the main industrial intermediate. At least 17,000\u00a0metric tons of fluorine are produced annually. It costs only $5\u20138 per kilogram as uranium or sulfur hexafluoride, but is many times more expensive as an element because of its challenging handling. Most of the processes that use large amounts of free fluorine use in situ generation under vertical integration. The largest application of fluorine gas, consuming up to 7,000 metric tons per year, is in the preparation of UF6 for the nuclear fuel cycle. Fluorine is used to fluorinate uranium tetrafluoride, which is formed from uranium dioxide and hydrofluoric acid. Fluorine is monoisotopic, so any difference in mass between UF6 molecules is due to the presence of 235U or 238U, which allows uranium enrichment by gas diffusion or gas centrifugation. Approximately 6,000 metric tons per year are used to produce the inert dielectric SF6 for high-voltage transformers and circuit breakers, eliminating the need for the dangerous polychlorinated biphenyls associated with oil-filled devices.",

Fluorine is also used in the synthesis of organic fluorides, but its reactivity often requires prior conversion to the milder ClF3, BrF3, or IF5, which together allow calibrated fluorination. Fluorinated drugs use sulfur tetrafluoride instead. As with other ferrous alloys, about 3 kg (6.5 lb) of metspar is added to each metric ton of steel; fluoride ion lowers its melting point and viscosity. Besides its role as an additive in materials such as enamels and welding rod coatings, most acidspar is reacted with sulfuric acid to form hydrofluoric acid, which is used in steel pickling, glass etching, and alkane cracking. One-third HF is used to synthesize cryolite and aluminum trifluoride, both of which flow in the Hall\u2013H\u00e9roult process for aluminum extraction; charging required by their reaction with smelting equipment. Each metric ton of aluminum requires approximately 23 kg (51 lb) of flux. Fluorosilicates account for the second largest share, with sodium fluorosilicate used in water fluoridation and sewage treatment, and as intermediates on their way to cryolite and silicon tetrafluoride. Other important inorganic fluorides include cobalt, nickel and ammonium. Organofluorides consume over 20% of mined fluorite and over 40% of hydrofluoric acid, with refrigerant gases dominating and fluoropolymers increasing their market share. Surfactant is a small app but generates over $1 billion in annual revenue. Due to the dangers of the direct hydrocarbon\u2013fluorine reaction above \u2212150\u00b0C (\u2212240\u00b0F), industrial production of fluorocarbons is indirect, mostly via halogen exchange reactions such as Swarts fluorination, in which chlorine chlorocarbons are replaced by fluorine by hydrogen fluoride under a catalyst. .",

Compounds such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), R-11, R-12, and R-114 once dominated organofluorines, with peak production in the 1980s. Used for air conditioning, propellant and solvent systems, production was below a tenth of this peak in the early 2000s, after widespread international bans. Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are designed as substitutes; Their synthesis consumes more than 90% of fluorine in the organic industry. Important HCFCs include R-22, chlorodifluoromethane, and R-141b. The most important HFC is R-134a with a new type of molecule, HFO-1234yf, a hydrofluoroolefin (HFO) that became popular due to its global warming potential of less than 1% of HFC-134a. Approximately 180,000 metric tons of fluoropolymer were produced in 2006 and 2007, generating over $3.5 billion in annual revenue. Sales on the global market were estimated at just under $6 billion in 2011 and are predicted to grow by 6.5% annually until 2016. Fluoropolymers can only be formed by polymerizing free radicals. Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), sometimes referred to as Teflon, represents 60\u201380% by mass of world fluoropolymer production. Its greatest application is in electrical insulation because PTFE is an excellent dielectric. It is also used in the chemical industry where corrosion resistance is required, in pipe coatings, tubing and gaskets. Another major use is in PFTE-coated fiberglass fabrics for stadium roofs. The main consumer application is for non-stick cookware. The snapped PTFE film becomes expanded PTFE (ePTFE), a fine porous membrane that is sometimes referred to by the brand name Gore-Tex and used for rainwear, protective clothing, and filters; ePTFE fibers may be made into dust seals and filters.",

Chemically resistant (but expensive) fluorinated ionomers are used in electrochemical cell membranes, of which the first and most prominent example is Nafion. Developed in the 1960s, it was initially used as a fuel cell material on spacecraft and later replaced the mercury-based chloralkali process cell. More recently, fuel cell applications have resurfaced with efforts to fit proton exchange membrane fuel cells into automobiles. Fluoroelastomers such as Viton are crosslinked fluoropolymer blends used primarily in O-rings; perfluorobutane (C4F10) is used as a fire extinguishing agent. Fluorosurfactants are small organofluorine molecules that are used to repel water and stains. Although expensive (compared to pharmaceuticals costing $200\u20132000 per kilogram), they generated over $1 billion in annual revenue in 2006; Scotchgard alone made over $300 million in 2000. Fluorosurfactants are a minority in the overall surfactant market, which is largely taken up by much cheaper hydrocarbon-based products. Applications in paints are burdened by compounding costs; these uses were valued at only $100 million in 2006. About 30% of agrochemicals contain fluorine, most of them being herbicides and fungicides with some plant regulators. Fluorine substitution, usually of a single atom or at most a trifluoromethyl group, is a powerful modification with effects analogous to those of fluorinated drugs: increasing biological residence time, crossing membranes, and altering molecular recognition. Trifluralin is an outstanding example, with large-scale use in the US as a weed killer, but it is a suspected carcinogen and has been banned in many European countries.",

New Zealand, 1080's largest consumer, uses it to protect kiwis from the invasive common Australian brushtail possum. Europe and the US have banned 1080.note 19] Population studies from the mid-20th century onwards have shown topical fluoride to reduce dental caries. This was first associated with the conversion of tooth enamel hydroxyapatite to the more durable fluorapatite, but studies in fluoridated teeth disproved this hypothesis, and current theory involves fluoride aiding enamel growth in small caries. Following studies of children in areas where fluoride is naturally present in drinking water, controlled fluoridation of public water supplies to fight tooth decay began in the 1940s and is now applied to water that supplies 6 percent of the global population, including two thirds of the American population. Reviews of the scientific literature in 2000 and 2007 associated water fluoridation with a significant reduction in tooth decay in children. Despite such support and evidence of the absence of adverse effects other than largely benign dental fluorosis, opposition still exists on ethical and safety grounds. The benefits of fluoridation have diminished, possibly due to other sources of fluoride, but are still measurable in lower income groups. Sodium monofluorophosphate and sometimes sodium or tin(II) fluoride are frequently found in fluoride toothpastes, first introduced in the US in 1955 and now ubiquitous in the developed world, along with fluoride mouthwashes, gels, foams, and varnishes.",

A prescription asthma combination Seretide, a top ten revenue drug in the mid-2000s, contains two active ingredients, one of which is \u2013 fluticasone \u2013 fluorinated. Many drugs are fluorinated to delay inactivation and extend the dosing period because the carbon\u2013fluorine bond is very stable. Fluorination also increases lipophilicity because the bonds are more hydrophobic than carbon\u2013hydrogen bonds, and this often aids in cell membrane penetration and bioavailability. Tricyclics and other pre-1980s antidepressants have few side effects due to their nonselective interference with neurotransmitters other than serotonin targets; fluorinated fluoxetine was chosen and was one of the first to avoid this problem. Many current antidepressants receive similar treatment, including the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors: sitalopram, its isomers esitalopram, and fluvoxamine, and paroxetine. Quinolones are artificial broad-spectrum antibiotics that are often fluorinated to enhance their effect. They include ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin. Fluorine is also used in steroids: fludrocortisone is a mineralocorticoid that can increase blood pressure, and triamcinolone and dexamethasone are strong glucocorticoids. The majority of inhalational anesthetics are highly fluorinated; the halotana prototype was much more slender and powerful than its contemporaries. Later compounds such as sevoflurane ether and fluorinated desflurane taste better than halothane and are nearly insoluble in the blood, allowing for a quicker wake-up time. Fluorine-18 is often found in radioactive tracers for positron emission tomography, because its half-life of nearly two hours is long enough to allow transport of it from the production facility to the imaging center.

One such product, Oxycyte, has gone through early clinical trials. This substance can help endurance athletes and has been banned in sports; the death of a cyclist in 1998 prompted an investigation into their abuse. Applications of pure perfluorocarbon liquid inhalation (which uses pure perfluorocarbon liquid instead of an aqueous emulsion) include helping burn victims and premature infants with lungs that are not working properly. Partial and complete lung filling have been considered, although only partial filling has had significant tests in humans. Alliance Pharmaceuticals' efforts reached clinical trials but were abandoned because the results were no better than normal therapy. Fluorine is not essential but in small amounts it is known to be useful for strengthening tooth enamel (where the formation of fluorapatite makes the enamel more resistant to attack, from acids produced by bacterial fermentation of sugars). Small amounts of fluorine may be beneficial for bone strength, but this has not been definitively established. Both the WHO and the Institute of Medicine of the US National Academies publish the recommended daily allowance (RDA) and tolerated fluorine intake, which vary by age and sex.

Its effects on humans begin at concentrations lower than 50 ppm hydrogen cyanide and are similar to those of chlorine: significant irritation to the eyes and respiratory system and damage to the liver and kidneys occurs above 25 ppm, which is an immediate danger to life and a health value for fluorine. The eyes and nose would be severely damaged at 100 ppm, and inhaling 1,000 ppm of fluorine would cause death within minutes, compared to 270 ppm for hydrogen cyanide. Hydrofluoric acid is the weakest hydrohalic acid, having a pKa of 3.2 at 25\u00b0C. It is a liquid that easily evaporates due to hydrogen bonds (while other hydrohalic acids are gases). It is capable of attacking glass, concrete, metal and organic materials. Hydrofluoric acid is a contact poison with greater danger than many strong acids such as sulfuric acid even though it is a weak acid: it remains neutral in aqueous solutions and can penetrate tissues more rapidly, either through inhalation, ingestion or skin, and at least nine US workers have died from 1984 to 1994 due to the accident. It reacts with calcium and magnesium in the blood causing hypocalcemia and possible death via cardiac arrhythmia. Formation of insoluble calcium fluoride provokes intense pain and burns larger than 160 cm2 (25 in2) can cause serious systemic toxicity.

One-fifth of a lethal dose can cause adverse health effects, and chronic excessive consumption can cause bone fluorosis, which affects millions of people in Asia and Africa. Ingested fluoride forms hydrofluoric acid in the stomach which is readily absorbed by the intestines, where it crosses cell membranes, binds to calcium and interferes with various enzymes, before being excreted in the urine. Exposure limits are determined by urine tests of the body's ability to clear fluoride ions. Historically, most cases of fluoride poisoning were caused by accidental ingestion of insecticides containing inorganic fluoride. Most of the recent calls to poison control centers for possible fluoride poisoning have come from consuming fluoride-containing toothpaste. Malfunctioning water fluoridation equipment is another culprit: one incident in Alaska affected nearly 300 people and killed one.

The Montreal Protocol, signed in 1987, establishes strict regulations regarding chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and bromofluorocarbons because of their ozone damaging potential (ODP).

In human physiology and psychology, sound is the reception of waves and their perception by the brain. Only acoustic waves that have frequencies between 20 Hz and 20 kHz, the audio frequency range, give rise to auditory perception in humans. In air at atmospheric pressure, it represents sound waves with a wavelength of 17 meters (56 ft) to 1.7 centimeters (0.67 in). Sound waves above 20 kHz are known as ultrasonic and are not audible to humans. Sound waves below 20 Hz are known as infrasound. Different animal species have varying hearing ranges. Acoustics is an interdisciplinary science concerned with the study of mechanical waves in gases, liquids and solids including vibration, sound, ultrasonic and infrasound. A scientist working in the field of acoustics is an acoustician, while someone working in the field of acoustic engineering may be called an acoustic engineer. An audio engineer, on the other hand, is concerned with the recording, manipulation, mixing and reproduction of sound. Applications of acoustics are found in almost all aspects of modern society, subdisciplines including aeroacoustics, audio signal processing, architectural acoustics, bioacoustics, electro-acoustics, environmental noise, musical acoustics, noise control, psychoacoustics, speech, ultrasound, underwater acoustics, and vibration.

In this case, sound is tactile. Sound can travel through media such as air, water and solids as a longitudinal wave as well as a transverse wave in a solid (see Longitudinal and transverse waves, below). Sound waves are generated by a sound source, such as the vibrating diaphragm of a stereo speaker. The sound source creates vibrations in the surrounding medium. When the source continues to vibrate the medium, the vibrations propagate away from the source at the speed of sound, thus forming sound waves. At a fixed distance from the source, the pressure, velocity, and displacement of the medium vary in time. At an instant, pressure, velocity, and displacement vary in space. Note that the media particles do not travel with sound waves. This is intuitively obvious for solids, and the same is true for liquids and gases (that is, the vibrations of particles in a gas or liquid transport vibrations, while the average position of the particles over time does not change). During propagation, waves can be reflected, refracted, or attenuated by the medium. Sound is transmitted through gases, plasmas and liquids as longitudinal waves, also called compression waves. It takes media to spread. However, through solids, it can be transmitted as longitudinal waves and transverse waves. Longitudinal sound waves are waves of alternating pressure deviation from the equilibrium pressure, which cause areas of local compression and smoothing, while transverse waves (in solids) are shear stress waves alternating at right angles to the direction of propagation. Sound waves can be \"seen\" using parabolic mirrors and sound-producing objects. The energy carried by the oscillating sound waves switches back and forth between the potential energy from the additional compression (in the case of longitudinal waves) or the lateral displacement (in the case of transverse waves) of the material, and the kinetic energy from the displacement velocity.",

Although there are many complexities associated with transmitting sound, at the point of reception (i.e. the ear), sound is readily divided into two simple elements: pressure and timing. These fundamental elements form the basis of all sound waves. They can be used to describe, in absolute terms, every sound we hear. To understand sound more fully, complex waves as shown in the blue background to the right of this text, are usually separated into their component parts, which are combinations of the various frequencies of the sound (and noise) wave. Sound waves are often simplified to a description in terms of sinusoidal plane waves, which are characterized by these general properties: Sound that is visible to humans has a frequency from about 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. In air at standard temperature and pressure, the corresponding wavelengths of sound waves range from 17 m (56 ft) to 17 mm (0.67 in). Sometimes velocity and direction are combined as a velocity vector; the number and direction of the waves are combined as a wave vector. Transverse waves, also known as shear waves, have an additional property, polarization, and are not a characteristic of sound waves. The speed of sound depends on the medium through which the waves travel, and is a fundamental property of materials. The first significant attempt towards measuring the speed of sound was made by Isaac Newton. He believed the speed of sound in a given substance to be equal to the square root of the pressure acting on it divided by its density: This was later proven wrong when it was found to be wrong to get the velocity. The French mathematician Laplace corrected the formula by concluding that the phenomenon of sound travel is not isothermal, as Newton believed, but adiabatic. He added another factor to the equation \u2014 gamma \u2014 and multiplied \u03b3{\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {\\gamma }}} by p/\u03c1{\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {p/\\rho }}}, thus coming up with the equation c= \u03b3\u22c5p/\u03c1{\\displaystyle c={\\sqrt {\\gamma \\cdot p/\\rho }}}.",

In this equation, K is the elastic bulk modulus, c is the speed of sound, and \u03c1{\\displaystyle \\rho } is the density. Thus, the speed of sound is proportional to the square root of the ratio of the medium's mass modulus to its density. The physical properties and speed of sound change with the surrounding conditions. For example, the speed of sound in a gas depends on temperature. In 20\u00b0C (68\u00b0F) air at sea level, the speed of sound is approximately 343 m/s (1,230 km/h; 767 mph) using the formula v m/s] = 331 + 0.6T \u00b0C ] In fresh water, also at 20\u00b0C, the speed of sound is about 1,482m/s (5,335km/h; 3,315mph). In steel, the speed of sound is about 5,960 m/s (21,460 km/h; 13,330 mph). The velocity of sound is also slightly sensitive, being subject to second-order anharmonic effects, to the amplitude of the sound, meaning that there are non-linear propagation effects, such as the production of harmonics and mixed overtones that are not present in the original sound (see parametric array). If relativistic effects are important, the speed of sound is calculated from the relativistic Euler equations. Sound pressure is the difference, in a given medium, between the mean local pressure and the pressure in a sound wave. The square of this difference (i.e., the square of the deviation from the equilibrium pressure) is usually averaged over time and/or space, and the square root of this average gives the root mean square (RMS) value. For example, a sound pressure of 1 Pa RMS (94 dBSPL) in atmospheric air implies that the actual pressure in a sound wave oscillates between (1 atm \u22122{\\displaystyle -{\\sqrt {2}}} Pa) and (1 atm +2{\\ displaystyle +{\\sqrt {2}}} Pa), which is between 101323.6 and 101326.4 Pa.

From an Islamic point of view, the conditions for a valid marriage are very important, especially to determine since when it is permissible for a man and a woman to have sexual intercourse so that they are free from adultery. Adultery is a very dirty act and can damage human life. In Islam, adultery is an act of grave sin which is not only a personal matter concerned with Allah, but is a violation of the law and it is obligatory to impose sanctions on those who commit it. In Indonesia, where the majority of the population is Muslim, Islamic law greatly influences the moral attitudes and legal awareness of the people. The Islamic religion uses a simple marriage tradition, with the aim that a person is not trapped or falls into adultery. This simple procedure seems to be in line with Law Number 1 of 1974 article 2 paragraph 1 which reads: \"Marriage is valid if it is carried out according to the laws of each religion and belief.\" This article seems to provide opportunities for elements of customary law to follow and even combine with Islamic law in marriage. Apart from that, it is caused by the awareness of the people who want it that way. One of the customary marriage procedures that is still visible today is a marriage that is not registered with an authorized official or is called unregistered marriage.",

Marriage is valid if it fulfills the pillars and conditions of marriage. As for those included in the pillars of marriage are as follows: If one of these conditions is not met, the marriage is considered invalid, and it is considered that there was never a marriage. Therefore it is forbidden for him who does not fulfill these pillars to have sexual relations or all religious prohibitions in association. Thus if the four pillars have been fulfilled then the marriage is considered valid. The above marriage according to Islamic law is considered valid, if the marriage is connected with the provisions of Law Number 1 article 2 paragraph 2 of 1974 concerning Marriage which reads: \"Every marriage is recorded according to the applicable laws and regulations.\" It is emphasized in the same law in article 7 paragraph 1 which states that marriage is only permitted if the man reaches the age of 19 and the woman has reached the age of 16. If you are still not old enough, Article 7 paragraph 2 explains that marriage can be legalized by asking for a dispensation from the court or other officials requested by both parents of the man or the woman. In Protestant Christian marriage ceremonies, marriage is seen as a three-way partnership between husband and wife before God. Marriage is sacred. A man and a woman form a household because they are united by God. They are no longer two, but one. In principle, the meaning of marriage in Protestant Christianity has the same meaning, but the rites and rules are different. Marriage regulations are looser, aka not as strict and complicated as in Catholic Christian marriages.",

Alcmene was the son of Electryon, king of Mycenae. His mother may have been Anaxo, daughter of Alcaeus and Astidamia, or Lysidis, daughter of Pelops and Hippodamia. Hesiod describes Alcmene as a woman of great beauty, wisdom and respect for her husband. According to Apollodorus, Alcmene went with Amphitryon to Thebes, where Amphitryon was purified by Creon (king of Thebes) from accidentally killing Electryon. Alcmene refused to marry Amphitryon until she could avenge the death of her brothers. However, during Amphitryon's expedition against the Taphos and Telebos peoples, Zeus disguised himself as Amphitryon and visited Alcmene. Extending one night to three times longer, Zeus sleeps with Alcmene (which causes Alcmene to become pregnant) and tells of Amphitryon's victory over the Telebos. When Amphitryon finally returned to Thebes, Alcmene told him that Amphitryon had come the night before and slept with him, and Amphitryon learned from Teiresias what Zeus had done. In Homer's Illiad, when Alcmene is about to give birth to Heracles, Zeus announces to all the gods that on that day a son of Zeus will be born who will rule all around him. Hera, after asking Zeus to swear on this statement, descended from Olympus to Argos and made Sthenelos' wife (daughter of Perseus) give birth to Euristheus at only seven months, while at the same time, Hera prevented Alcmene from giving birth to Heracles. This resulted in the fulfillment of Zeus' oath falling on Euristheus, not Heracles. According to Ovidius' Metamorphoses, Alcmene experienced difficulties trying to give birth to Heracles. After seven days and seven nights of agony, Alcmene reached out and begged Eileithyia, the goddess of birth.",

Arms folded and legs crossed, Eileithyia muttered an incantation to prevent Alcmene from giving birth. Alcmene struggled with pain, cursed the sky and was dying more and more. Galanthis, an Alcmene servant who was nearby, observed Eileithyia's actions and quickly deduced Hera's plan. She then announced that Alcmene had safely given birth to her child, to which Eileithyia was shocked and jumped up. As soon as Eileithyia jumped, Alcmene was released from the spell and was able to give birth to Heracles. As punishment for tricking Eileithyia, Galanthis was turned into a weasel but he stayed with Alcmene. In Pausanias' story, Hera sends witches to prevent Heracles from being born. The witches managed to prevent the birth until Historical, daughter of Teiresias, thought of a trick to trick the witches. Like Galanthis, the Historical announced that Alcmene had given birth to his child. The deceived witches finally left and allowed Alcmene to give birth. In contrast to the above stories, an alternative version is presented in Amphitryon, a comedy drama by Plauto. In this story, Alcmene summons Zeus who then gives a miracle to Alcmene to give birth quickly and easily. After thunder and lightning appeared, the baby was born without anyone's help. There are two opinions regarding Alcmene's death. According to the people of Megara, Alcmene was walking from Argos to Thebes when he died at Megara. The Heracleids (sons of Heracles) could not agree on where Alcmene would be buried. Some wanted Alcmene's body brought back to Argos, while others wanted it buried in Thebes (since Amphitryon was also buried in Thebes). Finally, Alcmene was buried in Megara on the advice of the Oracle of Delphi. The second version comes from the people of Thebes: when Alcmene died, he was turned to stone.",

After taking power, the revolutionaries used the state to introduce socialism. This concept is considered a particular type of \"putschism\", hence the view that political revolution must take the form of a putsch or coup. Blanquism was distinguished from other forms of socialist currents (notably Marxism) in a number of ways: in contrast to Marx, Blanqui did not believe in the primary role of the working class, nor in the popular movement, what he believed was that revolutions must be carried out by a small group of dedicated and professional revolutionaries, who may establish a provisional dictatorship by force. This dictatorship could enable the implementation of the basis for a new order, after which it would be given to the people. In other respects, Blanqui was more concerned with the revolution itself than with the future of society it would produce. If his thinking is based on proper socialist principles, it is rarely carried out until it results in a genuine socialist society. For the Blanquists, the abolition of the bourgeois social order and revolution was sufficient, at least for their proximate purposes. The Central Revolutionary Committee (CRC) was a French Blanquist political party founded in 1881 and dissolved in 1898. The CRC merged into the Socialist Revolutionary Party in 1898. The term \"Blanquism\" is often used controversially to accuse some revolutionaries of their failure to unify praxis them with the masses of the working class. Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels distinguished their concept of revolution from Blanquism.

A doctor who has completed special education in psychiatry is known as a psychiatrist. Before becoming a psychiatrist, a doctor must first undergo medical education. Then, the doctor must attend a four-year period of specialized training and education specifically studying the field of psychiatry. Upon completion, the doctor will be given the title of mental health specialist or psychiatrist. Child and adolescent psychiatry has a focus on dealing with children's problems with their emotions and behavior. Because the problems in these children have an impact on the function of learning and socialization. These problems are often not felt by parents directly, so children with these problems come to a psychiatrist for treatment in quite severe conditions. Psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents can lead to suicide, depression, bipolar, schizophrenia, substance abuse, conduct disorders, and eating disorders. One of the methods used in dealing with the behavior of children and adolescents is the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire method, or abbreviated as SDQ. The SDQ method is an instrument used for behavioral screening that is used for children and adolescents, with an age range of 3-17 years. The screening data is used to describe the behavior of children and adolescents regarding the strengths and difficulties they face. The SDQ method has a scale or dimensions, which are divided into five dimensions, namely prosocial behavior, hyperactivity, behavioral problems, emotional symptoms, and relationships with peers. Geriatrics is a branch of medical science that studies health and medicine for people who have entered the elderly stage, in which it discusses health services for the elderly by examining all aspects of health in the form of promotion, prevention, diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation.",

In Greek this collection of 5 books is called the Pentateuch (\"five vessels\" or \"five scrolls\"). The Torah is an important part of the Jewish canon/holy book. The five books of the Torah are: The word torah is from the Hebrew verb yarah. In the hifil conjugation, the word \u05d9\u05e8\u05d4 (yarah) means \"to teach, teach, show\" (eg Leviticus 10:11). So the word torah can mean \"teaching\" or \"instruction\", it can be teachings from the mother, teachings from the father, or teachings from God. The most frequently used translation, \"law\", is actually a misnomer, since the Hebrew word for \"law\" is din.

Some rabbinical sources state that the entire Torah was given at once on this occasion.

Ibn Ezra indicates, and Bonfils explicitly states, that Joshua (or possibly later prophets) wrote these parts of the Torah. Other rabbis did not share this view. In the Talmud (tractate Sabb. 115b) it is stated that there is a special part in the Book of Numbers, namely chapter 10:35-36, which is delimited by 2 Hebrew letters which are deliberately written backwards, is a separate book.

But many of these paintings are found in the depths of caves, in dark alcoves where it is rare to get attention from other humans, even to pass through these alcoves. Images were first created about 35,000 years ago. Since then, human creations have increased as more and more paintings have been created. Archaeologists call this period a creative explosion. The first cave paintings were discovered by Maria, daughter of amateur archaeologist Marcelino De Sautuola in 1879, in the form of a group of Aurochs (a type of bull (English: Ox) that has long been extinct) in the Altamira cave, northern Spain. Then one of the oldest and most famous drawings is the drawing in the Lascaux cave, France in 1940. The walls of the cave are filled with pictures of mammoths, bison, wildebeest and horses. There are also cave paintings found in 1969 in front of a cave near Twyfelfontein, Namibia, which are around 30,000 years old. And the paintings in the Chauvet cave, southwestern France, were discovered in 1994 and are 31,000 years old. Paintings or drawings are made using materials such as charcoal, chalk, coal, and others.",

His paintings show everyday events, in a schematic and conceptual style. The Egyptians used the most accessible point of view in depicting humans, from the side. They wanted a picture of the human body and every part of it as complete and clear as possible. The legs and head are always drawn from the side, while the shoulders, eyes, body are often drawn from the front. The Egyptians believed in life after death. Paintings found in Egyptian tombs and temples often depict events that will be experienced when the deceased are on their way to the next world. They think that the person who died will be accompanied by paintings and sculptures that will come alive. One of these is the fresco in the great temple of Ramses II at Thebes, which depicts the queen Nefertiti being taken by the goddess Isis.",

Painting on the walls of public buildings, such as temples, was viewed as a noble and important artistic activity, but the fragile medium of painting made Greek painting especially vulnerable to damage. One of the surviving Greek works is a fresco found in Vergina in 1977. However, Greek painting can still be seen on the vases and jars, called amphorae, which were used to store oil and wine. The pictures show Greek fairy tales or everyday life. Greek culture started from the culture of the Cretan region (Minois), then developed until it reached its classical form. At this time, the images of the paintings were heavily influenced by Christianity (Catholic), so that the themes of the paintings or sculptures were mostly about Jesus, church buildings whose interiors were decorative and luxurious and their exteriors plain and almost without decoration. The artists emphasized imagery over image quality, reflected in the larger image of Jesus and his followers, indicating that they were special. Basically, the paintings of this period are adaptations of the Greek era.

The type of climate in each region is strongly influenced by latitude. The characteristics of global climate patterns are studied through climatology. Climate is also based on weather characteristics that consider rain, temperature, and wind or evaporation conditions. Based on the latitude, the climate on the surface of the Earth can be divided into polar climate, temperate climate, subtropical climate, tropical climate and equatorial climate. Climate can also be distinguished based on regional conditions, namely continental climate, maritime climate, tundra climate, and mountain climate. Climatic conditions are controlled mainly by the atmosphere which is influenced by environmental factors. The types of environmental factors that affect the atmosphere are the shape of the earth, the earth's cover, and the position of air mixing in the atmosphere. The atmosphere influences the weather which then forms climate. The emergence of the term Climate cannot be separated from Paleoclimatology. Paleoclimatology is the study of ancient climates.

The difference between climate and weather is summed up by the popular line \"Climate is what you expect, weather is what you get. \". Over historical time there have been a number of nearly constant variables determining climate, including latitude, elevation, the proportion of land to water, and the distance between the sea and mountains. Those variables have only changed over millions of years due to processes such as plate tectonics. Other climate determinants are more dynamic such as oceanic thermohaline circulation causing 5\u00b0C (9\u00b0F) warming in the north Atlantic Ocean compared to other ocean basins. Other ocean currents redistribute heat between land and water on a more regional scale.

Changes in the quantity of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere determine the amount of solar energy stored by the planet, which causes global warming or global cooling.

        "paragraph": "The atmosphere is the factor that most influences the formation of climate in an area. Atmospheric conditions can change quickly due to outside influences. The atmosphere can change because it is influenced by the daily cycle of surface warming that changes on a regional and global scale. The atmosphere is related to the existence of the biosphere. The biosphere is the layer of the atmosphere that is still inhabited by living things. The thickness of the biosphere reaches 8 km. The condition of the biosphere is influenced by plant vegetation and human activities. Plant vegetation has seasonal changes that affect the albedo of a geographical area and its hydrological cycle. Meanwhile, human activities in the form of logging, agriculture and urbanization can cause climate change, both locally and globally. The hydrosphere influences climate over a period of months, years or centuries. The influence of the hydrosphere for climate lies in the condition of the oceans. Most of the sun's radiation is absorbed by the oceans which is then evaporated into the atmosphere. The evaporation of water into the atmosphere by the oceans causes the release of ocean heat energy into cloud drops. This condition makes ocean currents a heat diversion for the tropics which receive direct sunlight to the polar regions which are rarely exposed to sunlight. The influence of the cryosphere on climate is related to the reduction of warming on Earth. The cryosphere is mostly located in the polar regions. Meanwhile, a small portion is formed at very high mountain peaks, such as the peaks of the Jayawijaya mountains in Papua. The cryosphere consists of snow and ice. The properties of snow and ice in returning or reflecting solar radiation are better than oceans and land. The cryosphere may change over a period of years, but large differences occur only over hundreds to thousands of years. The formation of climate is also influenced by the pedosphere although the influence is only felt after a very long time.",

        "paragraph": "The pedosphere is located on a continental shelf. Changes in the pedosphere result in cooler temperatures in the continental areas. Pedosphere changes only occur at high latitudes in geological periods that only occur once in millions of years. The pedosphere has changed due to tectonic movements in the continental region. The round shape of the earth makes each region have a different climate. Sunlight cannot be received equally and evenly by every surface of the earth. In addition, the earth's surface has various types of topography. Each topographical form responds to the sunlight it receives differently. In general, climate types are distinguished and recognized through a review of various aspects, including time, scale, region and type. The most ancient and simplest method of dividing climate types is based on radiation reception. The division of climate types on the basis of radiation reception has been carried out since ancient Greece. Based on radiation reception, the climate is divided into five parts by delimiting four latitudes. First, the tropical climate with a limit of 23oLU\u201323oS. Second, the northern subtropical climate with a limit of 23oLU\u201366.5oLU. Third, the southern subtropical climate with a limit of 23oS\u201366.5oS. Fourth, the climate of the North Pole with a limit of 66.5oLU\u201390oLU. Finally, the south polar climate with a limit of 66.5oLS\u201390oLS. Based on the aspect of the time of its formation, climates can be divided into prehistoric climates, historical climates and quaternary climates. Prehistoric climate is a type of climate whose conditions are known based on ancient myths. The features of the prehistoric climate are conveyed in the absence of historical facts. Historical climate is a climate whose determination is based on objects that have historical value. The characteristics of the historical climate are conveyed through stories in written form. Quaternary climates are determined using layers of the earth or knowledge of geology. The type of quaternary climate is determined based on quaternary data.",
