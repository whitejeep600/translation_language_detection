This term is probably first used by Pythagoras (c. 570\u2013495SM). The methods used in philosophy include asking questions, critical discussion, dialectics, and systematic presentations. Classical philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know everything and prove it? What's the most real? Philosophers also ask more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be fair or unfair (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will? Historically, philosophy encompasses the core of all knowledge. From the time of Ancient Greek philosophers such as Aristotle until the 19th century, natural philosophy encompassed astronomy, medicine, and physics. For example, Newton's Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy in 1687 is later classified as a physics book. In the 19th century, the development of modern university research ushered in professionalized and specialized academic philosophy and other disciplines. In the modern era, several investigations that were traditionally part of philosophy have become separate academic disciplines, some of which are psychology, sociology, linguistics, and economics. Other investigations closely related to art, science, politics and several other fields remained part of philosophy. For example, is beauty objective or subjective? Are there many scientific methods or is there only one? Is political utopia a hopeful dream or a vain delusion? The main sub-fields of academic philosophy include metaphysics (dealing with the nature of reality and being), epistemology (concerning \"the origins and fields of knowledge and] ... their limits and validity\" ), ethics, aesthetics, political philosophy, logic, philosophy of science , and the history of western philosophy.",

Although there are forms of utilitarianism with different characteristics, the basic idea of \u200b\u200bethical utilitarianism is to maximize utility, or what is often defined in terms of welfare. Jeremy Bentham, founder of utilitarianism, defines utility as \"the character in any object that produces benefit, gain, pleasure, good, or happiness ... or] prevents harm, pain, evil, or unhappiness to those whose interests are considered. \u201d Utilitarianism is a version of consequentialism, an ethical theory that holds that the consequences of an action are the only standard by which right and wrong are judged.Unlike other forms of consequentialism, such as egoism and altruism, utilitarianism considers the interests of all humans to be equal.Proponents of utilitarianism Opinions differ on several issues, such as whether an action should be chosen on the basis of its probable consequences (action utilitarianism), or whether an agent should act according to a utility-maximizing rule (rule utilitarianism). ), the average utility (average utilitarianism) or the utility of the poorest people that must be maximized. Although the origins of ethical utilitarianism can be traced and found in the hedonic philosophy of Aristippus and Epicurus, who view happiness as a the only good, and in the work of the medieval Indian philosopher \u015a\u0101ntideva, the tradition of modern utilitarianism begins with Jeremy Bentham, and continues with such utilitarian philosophers as John Stuart Mill, Henry Sidgwick, RM Hare, and Peter Singer. The concept of utilitarianism has been applied to social welfare economics, the global poverty crisis, the ethics of raising animals for food, and the importance of avoiding existential risks to humanity. Utilitarian philosophy founded by Jeremy Bentham was substantially modified by his successor, John Stuart Mill, who popularized the term utilitarianism.",

Mill seems to have been unaware, however, that Bentham had used the term utilitarian in his 1781 letter to George Wilson and his 1802 letter to \u00c9tienne Dumont. The importance of happiness as the ultimate goal for humankind has long existed. hedonism has been argued by Aristippus and Epicurus; Aristotle argued that eudaimonia is the highest human good; and Augustine wrote that \"all men agree in desiring the ultimate end, which is happiness.\" Happiness is also discussed in depth by Thomas Aquinas, in his Summa Theologica. Meanwhile, in India Medieval, 8th-century Indian philosopher Shantideva was one of the earliest proponents of utilitarianism. He wrote that we must \"end all pain and suffering of all living beings now and in the future, and produce pleasure and happiness in the present and in the future.\" Forms of consequentialism also existed in the ancient and medieval world, such as the state consequentialism of Mohism or the political philosophy of Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli. Mohist consequentialism advocates the moral virtues of communitarianism, including political stability, population growth, and wealth, but does not support the utilitarian idea of \u200b\u200bmaximizing individual happiness. Utilitarianism as a separate ethical position emerged only in the 18th century. Although it is generally thought that utilitarianism began with Jeremy Bentham, there have been earlier authors who presented very similar theories. Francis Hutcheson first introduced the central utilitarian phrase in his work, An Inquiry into the Original of Our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue (1725): when choosing the most moral act, the amount of virtue in an action is proportional to the amount of happiness people derive from it.",

Initially, Kierkegaard himself saw himself as someone who tended to be religious rather than philosophical and somewhat distanced himself from philosophy, but later he became known as the father of existentialist philosophy. Kierkegaard bridged the gulf that existed between Hegelian philosophy and what would later become existentialism. Thus, Kierkegaard became a critic of Hegel in his time and characterized what he saw as the pseudo-formalism of the Danish Church. His philosophy is a reaction against Hegel's dialectics. Many of Kierkegaard's works deal with issues of religion such as the nature of faith, the institutions of the Christian Church, Christian ethics and theology, and the emotions and feelings of individuals when faced with existential choices. Kierkegaard's work has often been described as Christian existentialism and existential psychology. Because he wrote much of his early work under various pseudonyms, often commenting on and criticizing his other works written under other pseudonyms, it is difficult to distinguish between what Kierkegaard really believed and what he advanced as arguments. from the position of a pseudo-author. Ludwig Wittgenstein argues that Kierkegaard was \"by far, the most profound thinker of the 19th century\". S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard was born into an affluent family in Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark. His father, Michael Pedersen Kierkegaard, was a very devout man. He believed that he had been cursed by God, and because of that he believed that none of his children would reach the age of Jesus Christ, which was 33 years. He believed that his personal sins, such as cursing God's name in his youth and possibly impregnating Kierkegaard's mother out of wedlock, caused him to deserve this punishment.",

Despite his father's occasional religious melancholy, Kierkegaard and his father shared a close bond. He learned to use his imagination through a series of exercises and games they played together. Kierkegaard's father died on 9 August 1838 at the age of 82. Before he died, he asked S\u00f8ren to become a priest. S\u00f8ren was deeply influenced by his father's religious and life experiences and felt burdened to fulfill his will. Two days later, on 11 August, Kierkegaard wrote: \"Father passed away Wednesday. I sincerely wish that he had lived a few years longer, and I consider his death to be the last sacrifice he made out of love for me; ... he died because of me so that, if possible, I could still be something.All that I have inherited from him, his memory, his transfigured portrait ... are precious to me, and I will try to preserve ( memories) to be safely hidden from the world.\" Kierkegaard attended the Citizen Virtue School, obtaining excellent grades in Latin and history. He continued his studies in theology at the University of Copenhagen, but while there he became increasingly interested in philosophy and literature. At university, Kierkegaard wrote his dissertation, On the Concept of Irony with Constant Reference to Socrates, which the university panel considered important and well thought out, but a bit too flowery and literary to be a philosophy thesis.",

Poverty can be caused by scarcity of means of meeting basic needs, or difficulty accessing education and employment. Poverty is a global problem. Some people understand this term subjectively and comparatively, while others see it from a moral and evaluative point of view, and still others understand it from an established scientific angle, and so on. Poverty is understood in different ways. The main understanding includes: Poverty can be grouped into two categories, namely absolute poverty and relative poverty. Absolute poverty refers to a consistent set of standards, regardless of time and place/country. An example of an absolute measure is the percentage of the population that eats below the amount sufficient to sustain the human body's needs (approximately 2000-2500 calories per day for an adult male). The World Bank defines absolute poverty as living with an income below United States Dollars (USD) $1/day and middle poverty for an income below $2 per day, with these limits it is estimated that in 2001 1.1 billion people in the world consumed less than $1/day and 2.7 billion people worldwide consume less than $2/day.\" The proportion of the population of developing countries living in extreme poverty has fallen from 28% in 1990 to 21% in 2001.

To avoid this stigma, these countries are usually referred to as developing countries. Poverty cannot be understood using one dimension or one indicator only. Poverty is very complex, so multidimensional indicators or measures are needed. The indicators that are widely used are global indicators using a monetary approach such as the poverty line used by the World Bank with a limit of USD 1.25 Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) or through the basic consumption approach (basic need) which is also used in Indonesia. Meanwhile, this approach only looks at indicators of income or consumption by the community and according to Sen (2000) is considered not to have captured the real root causes of poverty. To look at the problem of poverty holistically, IKM (Multidimensional Poverty Index) was developed. The concept was first developed by the Oxford Poverty and Human Initiative (OPHI) in collaboration with the Nation Development Program (UNDP) in 2010. The main objective of developing the concept is to map poverty indicators more comprehensively and clearly. As a result, when adopted in Indonesia, there are three indicators that are used to understand the problem of poverty, namely health, education, and quality of life standards. These indicators show that monetary and consumption approaches alone are not enough to provide a clear picture of poverty, other indicators are needed such as health, education, and quality of life standards. Debates related to the state of human capital and one's individual capital tend to focus on access to instructional capital and social capital which are available only to those who are educated in the formal system. The Copenhagen Declaration defines absolute poverty as \"a condition characterized by severe deprivation of basic human needs, including food, safe drinking water, sanitation facilities, health, housing, education and information.\"",

Kant's comprehensive and systematic work in the fields of epistemology, metaphysics, ethics, and aesthetics has made him one of the most influential figures in modern Western philosophy. In his account of transcendental idealism, Kant argued that space and time are simply \"intuitive forms\" that shape all experience. Therefore, although the \"thing-in-itself\" exists and contributes to experience, it is still distinct from the object of experience. From this it can be concluded that the object of experience is only what appears, and the nature of things in themselves (an sich) cannot be known by humans. In an effort to counter the skepticism he found in the writings of the philosopher David Hume, he wrote Critique of Pure Reason (1781/1787), one of his most famous works. In that work, he developed a theory of experience to answer the question whether synthetic a priori knowledge is possible. This in turn will make it possible to define the limits of metaphysical inquiry. Kant equated his idea with the Copernican revolution to determine sense objects as something that is in accordance with our spatial and temporal intuition forms, so that we have a priori cognition about these objects. a] Kant holds that reason is the source of morality, and aesthetics arises from the ability of impartial judgment . Kant's views continue to have a major influence on contemporary philosophy, especially post-modern epistemology, ethics, political theory, and aesthetics.

Kant's religious views have continued to be the subject of scholarly debate, ranging from the suggestion that he shifted from an ontological argument for the existence of God to principled agnosticism, to a more critical view exemplified by Schopenhauer, who criticized Kant's ethical imperative form as \"theological morals\", to Nietzsche who claimed that Kant had \"theological blood\" and was only an expert defender of traditional Christianity. b] Outside of his religious views, Kant has been criticized for racism in several of his papers such as \"On the Use of Teleological Principles in Philosophy\" and \"On the Differences of Races\" Man\". Although he was a supporter of scientific racism for most of his career, Kant's views on race changed significantly in the last decades of his life. Ultimately, Kant rejected racial hierarchies and European colonialism in his Towards Lasting Peace: A Philosophical Concept (1795). During his lifetime, Kant also published other important works on ethics, religion, law, aesthetics, astronomy, and history. These include Universal Natural History (1755), Critique of Practical Reason (1788), Criticism of Judgment (1790), Religion within the Limits of Pure Reason (1793), and Moral Metaphysics (1797).

Buddhism arose in ancient India as a Sramana tradition sometime between the 6th and 4th centuries B.C., spreading through much of Asia. The Buddha is known by Buddhists as the enlightened or enlightened Supreme Master who shared His insights to help sentient beings end their suffering by eliminating ignorance/ignorance/delusion (moha), greed (lobha), and hatred/anger ( sin). The ending or extinction of moha, lobha and sin is called Nibbana.

Mahayana Buddhism, on the other hand, aspires to attain buddhahood through the bodhisattva path, a state in which one remains in the cycle of helping other beings attain enlightenment. Each school of Buddhism adheres to the Tipitaka as the main reference because it contains the words and teachings of Gautama Buddha.

This field of study is categorized as a branch of atmospheric science and a subfield of physical geography, which is one of the earth sciences. Climatology also includes aspects of oceanography and biogeochemistry. Basic knowledge of climate can be used in weather forecasting using analogous methods in the case of ENSO, Madden-Julian Oscillation, North Atlantic Oscillation, and so on. Climate models are also used to study weather dynamics and the climate system to project climate in the future. The Chinese scholar Shen Kuo (1021-1095) suggested that the climate naturally shifted over time, after observing weather-preserved bamboo near Yanzhou (Yan'an, Shaanxi province), because a dry area would be impossible for bamboo to grow. Early climate researchers, such as Edmund Halley, published maps of wind movement in 1686 after his trip to the Southern Hemisphere. Benjamin Franklin (1706-1790) first charted the path of the Gulf Stream to use as a method of postal delivery from the United States to Europe. Francis Galton (1822-1911) coined the term \"anticyclone\". Helmut Landsberg (1906-1985) developed the use of statistical analysis in climatology which sparked the drastic development of climatology into a physical science. Climatology is done in various ways. Paleoclimatology reprojects past climates by examining records such as ice cores and tree growth rings (dendroclimatology). Paleotempestology uses the same records to determine the frequency of hurricanes over thousands of years. Contemporary climate studies involve meteorological data accumulated over a period of several years, such as data on precipitation, temperature, and composition of the atmosphere.",

        "paragraph": "Knowledge of the atmosphere and its dynamics is also collected in models, such as statistical modeling or mathematical modelling, which integrate various observations and test their fit. Modeling is used to understand climate in the past, present climate, and future climate. Historical climatology is the study of climate as a factor influencing the development of human history and focuses only on periods of hundreds or tens of thousands of years. Research on climate is quite difficult to do because it involves a very large area, a very long period of time, and a complex process. Because it is the result of averaging weather parameters over a very long period of time, climate can be described by differential equations. These equations are connected nonlinearly so that approximate solutions can be obtained by using numerical methods to create climate models. Climate is often modeled as a stochastic process. However, it is generally accepted as an approximation of climate processes that are too complex to analyze. Scientists use climate patterns based on multiple climate patterns (known as variability modes) in their attempts to characterize and understand the various climatic mechanisms that culminate in everyday weather. Climate patterns are generally designed simply as two objects that complement each other in that period, which oscillate like the El Nino phenomenon which is then followed by La Nina, then returns to El Nino. The most commonly discussed is the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation, but other climate phenomena such as the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), Northern Annular Mode (NAM) or Arctic Oscillation (AO), Pacific Index North, Pacific Decade Oscillation (PDO), Interdecade Pacific Oscillation (IPO) El Nino is a global atmosphere-ocean phenomenon. As the characteristics of the Pacific Ocean, El Nino and La Nina are important temperature fluctuations in surface waters in the tropical area around the Pacific Ocean.",

Among the Buddha's many disciples, \u0100nanda stood out for having the best memory. Most of the early Buddhist texts of the Sutta-Pi\u1e6daka (P\u0101li: \u0938\u0941\u0924\u094d\u0924 \u092a\u093f\u091f\u0915; Sanskrit: \u0938\u0942\u0924\u094d\u0930-\u092a\u093f\u091f\u0915, S\u016btra-Pi\u1e6daka) are associated with his recollection of the Buddha's teachings during the First Buddhist Council. As such, he is known as the Treasurer of the Dhamma, where Dhamma (Sanskrit: \u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e, dharma) refers to the teachings of the Buddha. In early Buddhist texts, \u0100nanda is the first cousin of the Buddha. Although the early texts disagree on many parts of \u0100nanda's early life, they agree that \u0100nanda was ordained as a monk and that Pu\u1e47\u1e47a Mant\u0101n\u012bputta (Sanskrit: \u092a\u0942\u0930\u094d\u0923 \u092e\u0948\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093e\u092f\u0923\u0940\u092a\u0941\u0924\u094d\u0930, P\u016br\u1e47\u012bat Maitr's son) became his guru. Twenty years in the Buddha's service, \u0100nanda had become the Buddha's servant, when the Buddha selected him for this task. \u0100nanda performed his duties with great devotion and care, and acted as an intermediary between the Buddha and the laity, as well as a sa\u1e45gha (Sanskrit: \u0938\u0902\u0918, translit. sa\u1e43gha, lit. 'monastic community'). He accompanied the Buddha for the rest of his life, acting not only as an assistant, but also secretary and spokesman. Scholars are skeptical about the historicity of many events in \u0100nanda's life, especially the First Council, and a consensus on this point has not been established. Traditional accounts can be drawn from early texts, commentaries, and post-canonical chronicles. \u0100nanda has an important role in building the order of monks (Sanskrit: \u092d\u093f\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0941\u0923\u0940, translit.

Shortly after the Buddha's death, the First Council was convened, and \u0100nanda was able to attain enlightenment just before the council started, which was a requirement. He had a historical role during the council as a living memory of the Buddha, reciting many of the Buddha's discourses and checking them for accuracy. However, during the same council, she was punished by Mah\u0101kassapa (Sanskrit: \u092e\u0939\u093e\u0915\u093e\u0936\u094d\u092f\u092a, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa) and by the sa\u1e45gha for allowing women to be ordained and for failing to understand or respect the Buddha on key moments. \u0100nanda continued to teach until the end of his life, passing on his spiritual heritage to his students, including the S\u0101\u1e47av\u0101s\u012b (Sanskrit: \u0936\u093e\u0923\u0915\u0935\u093e\u0938\u0940, \u015a\u0101\u1e47akav\u0101s\u012b) and Majjhantika (Sanskrit: \u092e\u0927\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0928\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0915), who later took major roles in the Third Council and Madhy\u0101\u0915. \u0100nanda died 20 years after the death of the Buddha, and stupas (monuments) were erected at the river where he died. \u0100nanda is one of the most beloved figures in Buddhism. He was known for his memory, knowledge and compassion, and was often praised by the Buddha for these. He serves as a protector for the Buddha, although he still has worldly attachments and is not yet enlightened, unlike the Buddha. In the Sanskrit textual tradition, \u0100nanda is considered the patriarch of the Dhamma who stood in a spiritual lineage, receiving teachings from Mah\u0101kassapa and passing them on to his own disciples. \u0100nanda has been honored by nuns since the early Middle Ages for his services in founding the nuns' order. In contemporary times, composer Richard Wagner and Indian poet Rabindranath Tagore have drawn inspiration from the story of \u0100nanda in their works. The word \u0101nanda (\u0906\u0928\u0928\u094d\u0926) in P\u0101li and Sanskrit means 'bliss, joy'.",

Although the modern German nation-state was only formed in 1871 after the Franco-Prussian War, political units in this region have long played an important position in the monarchical era in Europe from the time of rule by the Roman Empire towards the modern era (AD) until the end of the Napoleonic Wars. The unification of Central Europe under Charles the Great (Charlemagne), leader of the Frankish Empire, in the 8th century paved the way for the formation of a nearly 1000-year-old confederative empire known as the Holy Roman Empire. This empire deeply colored feudal culture throughout Europe and became the center of the Reformation of the Christian church in the 16th century which gave birth to Protestantism. When the Holy Roman Empire was dissolved in 1806 as a result of the divisions caused by the Napoleonic wars, a sense of one nation had grown as a people with a common language (German). However, the modern state that was formed later was unable to unite these national ideals because Austria formed an ally with Hungary to become a separate state from the modern German state. In 1949, Germany, with its territory greatly reduced by the two major wars in Europe, was divided into two separate countries: West Germany and East Germany.",

        "paragraph": "The atom is a basic unit of matter, consisting of an atomic nucleus and a cloud of negatively charged electrons that surrounds it. The atomic nucleus consists of positively charged protons and neutrally charged neutrons (except in the atomic nucleus of Hydrogen-1, which has no neutrons). The electrons in an atom are bound to the nucleus by electromagnetic forces. A collection of such atoms can also bond with each other, and form a molecule. Atoms containing the same number of protons and electrons are neutral, while those containing a different number of protons and electrons are positive or negative and are called ions. Atoms are grouped based on the number of protons and neutrons contained in the atomic nucleus. The number of protons in an atom determines the chemical element of that atom, and the number of neutrons determines the isotope of that element. The term atom comes from the Greek (\u1f04\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2/\u00e1tomos, \u03b1-\u03c4\u03b5\u03bc\u03bd\u03c9), which means indivisible or indivisible. The concept of the atom as an indivisible component was first proposed by Indian and Greek philosophers. In the 17th and 18th centuries, chemists laid the foundations for this idea by showing that certain substances could not be broken down any further by chemical methods. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, physicists discovered subatomic structures and components within atoms, proving that the 'atom' was not indivisible. The principles of quantum mechanics used by physicists then succeeded in modeling the atom. In everyday observation, relatively atom is considered a very small object that has a proportionally small mass. Atoms can only be monitored using special equipment such as an atomic force microscope. More than 99.9% of the atomic mass is centered in the atomic nucleus,note 1] with protons and neutrons having almost the same mass.",

This can result in transmutation, which changes the number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus. Electrons bound to atoms contain a number of stable energy levels, or orbitals, and can undergo transitions between them by absorbing or emitting photons that match the energy differences between the levels. The electrons in an atom determine the chemical properties of an element, and influence the magnetic properties of that atom. The concept that matter is composed of discrete units that cannot be subdivided into smaller units has been around for a millennium. However, these thoughts are still abstract and philosophical in nature, rather than based on empirical observations and experiments. Philosophically, descriptions of the properties of atoms vary depending on the culture and school of philosophy, and often contain spiritual elements in them. Nevertheless, the basic ideas about atoms could be accepted by scientists thousands of years later, because they could elegantly explain new discoveries in the field of chemistry. The earliest reference to the concept of the atom can be traced back to ancient India in 800 BC, which are described in Jain philosophical texts as anu and paramanu. The Nyaya and Vaisesika schools of thought developed theories that explained how atoms combined to form more complex things. A century later, references to atoms in the West appeared by Leucippos, who later systematized this view by his student Demokritos. Around 450 BC, Democritus coined the term \u00e1tomos (Greek: \u1f04\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2), meaning \"uncut\" or \"undividable\".

Since volume measurement plays an important role in titrations, this technique is also known as volumetric analysis. Titrimetric analysis is one of the main parts of analytical chemistry and its calculations are based on the stoichiometric relationship of chemical reactions. Analysis of the titrimetric method is based on chemical reactions such as: aA + tT \u2192 results with information: (a) analyte A molecules react with (t) reactant molecules T The T reagent, called the titrant, is added in small increments, usually from a burette, in the form of a solution of known concentration. The latter solution is called the standard solution and its concentration is determined by a standardization process. The addition of the titrant is continued until an amount of T equivalent to A has been added. Then it is said that the titrant equivalence point has been reached. In order to know when adding titrant has stopped, the chemist can use a chemical, called an indicator, which responds to the presence of excess titrant by changing color. Acid-base indicators are made of weak organic acids or bases, which have a different color when in a dissociated state or not. This color change may or may not occur at the exact equivalence point. The titration point when the indicator changes color is called the end point. It is certainly a hope, that the end point is as close to the equivalence point as possible. Choosing an indicator to make the two points coincide (or making corrections for the difference between the two) is an important aspect of titrimetric analysis. The term titration concerns the process of measuring the volume of titrant required to reach the equivalence point. Over the years the term volumetric analysis has been used instead of titrimetric. From a strict point of view, however, the term titrimetric is preferable, because volume measurements need not be limited by titrations.",

A reagent, known as a titrant, of known concentration (standard solution) and volume is used to react a titrated solution of unknown concentration. By using a calibrated burette to add the titre, it is possible to determine the exact amount of solution needed to reach the endpoint. The end point is the point at which the titration is completed, which is determined by an indicator. Ideally the indicator will change color at the equivalence point\u2014where the volume of the titrant added with a given mole equals the value of the moles of solution titrated. In strong acid-base titrations, the end point is the point at which the pH of the reactants is nearly 7, and usually when the solution turns pink due to the presence of the pH indicator phenolphthalein. Apart from acid-base titrations, there are also other types of titrations. Many methods can be used to indicate the end point in a reaction; titrations usually use a visual indicator (a solution of a reactant that changes color). In simple acid-base titrations, pH indicators can be used, an example being phenolphthalein, where the phenolphthalein turns pink when the solution reaches a pH of about 8.2 or exceeds it. Another example of a pH indicator that can be used is methyl orange, which turns red in acids and yellow in alkaline solutions. Not all titrations require an indicator. In some cases, both the reactants and products already have contrasting colors and can be used as \"indicators\". For example, a redox titration using potassium permanganate (pink/purple) as a titrant does not require an indicator. When the titer is reduced, the solution will become colorless.

Criminal law is the law that regulates the relationship between legal subjects in terms of actions that are required and prohibited by laws and regulations, norms and result in the imposition of sanctions in the form of punishment and fines for violators. In criminal law, there are 2 types of acts, namely crimes and violations. In Indonesia, criminal law is regulated in general in the Criminal Code (KUHP), which is a relic from the Dutch colonial era, previously named Wetboek van Straafrecht (WvS).

It is the third largest country in Latin America and also the country that speaks the most Spanish. The name of this country is taken from the name of the capital which comes from the name of the ancient Aztec capital, namely Mexico-Tenochtitlan. Mexi is part of the name Mexitli, namely the name of the god of war while co means 'place' and ca means 'people'. For nearly 3,000 years, Mexico was home to several advanced civilizations such as the Amerindian, Mayan and Aztec civilizations. The arrival of the Spanish conquistadors under the sage Hernan Cortes in the early 16th century, and their victory over the Aztecs in 1521, marked the beginning of the era of colonizing Mexico as New Spain. On September 15, 1810, independence from Spain was declared by Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla in Dolores, a small town. This was the starting point of the war for independence known as the Mexican War of Independence which ended with independence in 1821, and the formation of the First Mexican Empire. After independence, all the countries of Central America except Chiapas, agreed not to become part of this empire. After the Empire fell to republican forces led by Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna, the first Republic was formed with Guadalupe Victoria as its first President. Under Santa Anna, residents of the Texan section of Coahuila and Texas had revolted, demanding independence from the Mexican government.

The history of chemistry can be traced back to alchemy, which was practiced for millennia in various parts of the world. The word chemistry comes from alchemy, a designation for a series of ancient practices that included elements of chemistry, metallurgy, philosophy, astrology, mysticism, and medicine. Alchemy is often thought of as having to do with turning lead or other common raw materials into gold, but in ancient times it studied many issues of modern chemistry. Alchemy was defined by the early 4th century AD Greco-Egyptian alchemist, Zosimos, as the study of the composition of water, its movement, growth, appearance, disappearance, expulsion of the spirit from the body, and bonding of the spirit within the body. The word alchemy comes from the Arabic word al-k\u012bm\u012b\u0101 (\u0627\u0644\u06a9\u06cc\u0645\u06cc\u0627\u0621).

For example, physical chemistry involves applying the principles of physics to matter at the atomic and molecular level. Chemistry deals with the interactions of matter which can involve two substances or between matter and energy, especially in relation to the first law of thermodynamics. Traditional chemistry involves interactions between chemical substances in chemical reactions, which change one or more substances into one or more other substances. Sometimes these reactions are driven by enthalpy considerations, as when two highly enthalpy substances such as elemental hydrogen and oxygen react to form water, the substance with lower enthalpy. The chemical reaction can be facilitated by a catalyst, which is generally another chemical that is involved in the reaction medium but is not consumed (an example is sulfuric acid which catalyzes the electrolysis of water) or an immaterial phenomenon (such as electromagnetic radiation in a photochemical reaction). Traditional chemistry also deals with the analysis of chemical substances, both inside and outside of a reaction, as in spectroscopy. All normal matter is composed of atoms or subatomic components that make up atoms; protons, electrons, and neutrons. Atoms can be combined to produce more complex forms of matter such as ions, molecules or crystals. The structure of the world we live in every day and the properties of the matter with which we interact are determined by the properties of chemical substances and the interactions between them. Steel is harder than iron because the atoms are bonded together in a more rigid crystalline structure. Wood burns or undergoes rapid oxidation because it can react spontaneously with oxygen in a chemical reaction if it is above a certain temperature.

In general, the topic of metaphysical analysis includes discussions about existence, actual existence and accompanying characteristics, space and time, relations between existences such as discussions about causality, possibility, and other metaphysical discussions. Given the range of studies it focuses on, metaphysics becomes a fundamental discipline in the study of philosophy. Throughout the history of philosophy, metaphysics reaches out to classical problems in theoretical philosophy.

Jupiter's upper atmosphere is composed of 88\u201392% hydrogen and 8\u201312% helium by volume percent or molecular fraction. Since the atomic mass of helium is four times that of hydrogen atoms, the composition changes when described in terms of mass proportions. Thus, Jupiter's atmosphere is composed of 75% hydrogen and 24% helium by mass, with the remaining one percent being the mass of other elements. Jupiter's interior contains denser matter so its distribution by mass is approximately 1% hydrogen, 24% helium and 5% other elements. Jupiter's atmosphere contains methane, water vapor, ammonia and silicon-based compounds. There is also carbon, ethane, hydrogen sulfide, neon, oxygen, phosphine, and sulfur. The outermost layer of the atmosphere contains frozen ammonia crystals. Through infrared and ultraviolet measurements, the presence of benzene and other hydrocarbons was also discovered. The proportions of hydrogen and helium in the atmosphere are about the same as the theoretical composition of the primordial solar nebula.",

        "paragraph": "Chemistry Astronomy Earth Sciences Health sciences Ecology is a branch of biology that studies the interactions between living things and other living things and also with the surrounding environment. In environmental science, ecology is used as a basic science to understand interactions in the environment. The components involved in this interaction can be divided into biotic (living) and abiotic (non-living) components. Ecological systems are formed from the unity and interaction between components that make up an ecosystem that are interconnected with one another. Ecological analysis is used by humans to create a sustainable living environment in an accountable way for security and sustainability, and well-being. Ecological principles are used in analyzing the human environment, population growth, increased food production, greening, erosion, flooding, preservation of germplasm and endangered animals, collection of rare fruits, and environmental pollution. Ecology is a science with a broad and complex topic, which includes hierarchy and biodiversity, number and distribution of organisms, roles and interactions between organisms, habitats and niches, food webs, nutrient and biogeochemical cycles, and various other processes. Various approaches can be used to classify ecology into a number of sub-disciplines, both according to spatial (place) and temporal (time) patterns, subjects studied, and links to other fields of science. There are no clear boundaries regarding the beginnings of ecology as a scientific discipline. Nonetheless, ecological principles have been studied since ancient Greece by Aristotle. Aristotle's student Theophrastus then observed and explained the relationship between organisms and their environment. He focused on the reasons certain species prefer certain environments. As early as the 19th century AD, Alexander von Humboldt described the correlation between plant associations (such as grasslands, rainforests, and tundra) and environmental factors (such as temperature, rainfall, and topography) to understand the number and distribution of animal and plant species.",

Three years after publishing this term, Haeckel defined ecology as the whole science of the relationships of organisms to the external world around them and those that can be accounted for in a broader sense under all conditions of existence. It is partly organic, partly inorganic. Experts view the definition of ecology presented by Haeckel as part of physiology. Charles Krebs then separated ecology from the study of physiology. He explained that ecology is a science that examines the interactions of living things which explains the distribution and diversity of living things. In environmental interactions, ecology remains inseparable from physiology. Krebs' definition of ecology is then used as the core of ecological studies. George Evelyn Hutchinson (1903\u20131991) has been called the father of limnology and the father of modern ecology. He comprehensively observes and empirically measures organic and environmental factors that can affect the biota of a lake, and lays the foundations of ecological niches. Ecology then became popular around the 1960s when environmental issues started to get public attention. The development of ecological science and its relationship with other sciences occurred in 1968 and 1970 with the emergence of the environmental awareness movement. People are starting to think about the problems of pollution, nature conservation, population and food and energy consumption. Prior to the 1970s, ecology was still viewed as part of biology. After that, ecology became a scientific discipline separate from biology. Ecological studies are concerned with physical and biological processes and link the natural and social sciences. At present, ecology is associated with various other fields of science because of its high complexity, ranging from philosophy to mathematics.",

        "paragraph": "In chemistry, conformational isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism in which molecules with the same structural formula but different conformations are caused by the rotation of atoms in chemical bonds. Different conformers can be exchanged with each other by rotating single bonds without breaking chemical bonds. The existence of more than one conformation, usually with different energies, is due to the hindered rotation of sp3 orbital hybridization of carbon atoms. Conformational isomerism only occurs in single bonds because double and triple bonds have pi bonds that hinder bond rotation. Comparison of the stability of different conformers is usually explained by differences in the combination of steric repulsion and electronic effects. A simple example is seen in the butane molecule viewed using the Newman projection as shown above. Rotamers are conformers that differ only in single bond rotation. The rotational barrier is the activation energy required to change from one conformer to another. There are two important forms of conformational isomerism: Another example of conformational isomerism is molecular folding, in which some forms of folding are stable and functional, but others are not. Conformational isomerism is also seen in atropisomers. The different populations of conformers follow the Boltzmann distribution: The approximate side of the equation is the equilibrium ratio of conformer i to the total conformers. Erel{\\displaystyle E_{rel}} is the relative energy of the ith conformer of the minimum energy conformer. R is the gas molar constant of 8.31 J/K/mol and T is the temperature in Kelvin (K). The denominator on the right is the partition function. If the overlapping conformation of an isomer has a high enough potential, it can be prevented from rotating into another conformation.

Spindle-shaped seeds, grooved lengthwise. Taro is primarily grown for its edible tubers, which are an important source of carbohydrates. However, this tuber contains an itchy sap, which varies in sharpness according to the type, so it must be cooked before it can be consumed. Eating taro should not be excessive, because it contains sap which causes itching. Eating too much taro causes a feeling of bloating and indigestion. Taro tubers can be processed by steaming, boiling, baking, frying, or processing into flour, porridge, and pastries. In some areas of Indonesia where rice cannot grow, including the Mentawai Islands and Papua, taro is eaten as a staple food, by roasting, steaming, or cooking it in bamboo tubes. In Hawaii and parts of the Islands. In Polynesia, taro tubers are steamed and pounded to make a paste which can then be fermented to produce pudding. In Java as well as in other places in Indonesia, taro tubers are steamed or fried to be enjoyed as a snack. In addition to the tubers, young taro leaves and petioles can be used as vegetables. Sayur lompong from West Java is a type of curry that uses the young taro shoots and leaf stalks, cooked with or without coconut milk. Its young leaves are known as the preferred buntil wrappers. Taro leaves, old or young, are also used as feed for carp. The leaves, petioles and tubers are used as a mixture of animal feed, especially for pigs.",

Shaastra comes from the basic words \u015b\u0101s- or shaas- (Sanskrit: \u0936\u093e\u0938\u094d) which means to direct, teach, give instructions or instructions, and tra (Sanskrit: \u0924\u094d\u0930) which means a tool or means. Literary texts are also not only texts that contain teaching instructions, more than that in Indonesian this word is commonly used to refer to \"literature\" or a type of writing that has a certain meaning or beauty. It is also necessary to know that there is the use of literary and literary terms. Literary segmentation refers more according to its definition as just text. Meanwhile, literature is more directed to literature with a strong poetic or abstract nuance. The term writer is one example, defined as a person who is engaged in literature, not literature. Because, a writer is someone who likes poetic and abstract nuances, not just texts. In addition, in a literary sense, literature can be divided into written literature or oral literature (oral literature). Here literature has little to do with writing, but with language which is used as a vehicle for expressing certain experiences or thoughts. Sugiantomas, stated that literature is the result of human creative activity which is poured into language media, both spoken and written. A work of art can be said to be a work of literary value not only because the language is beautiful, square, full of rhythm and imagery, but must be seen as a whole; of aesthetic values, moral values, and conceptual values \u200b\u200bcontained in the literary work.

It has a diameter of about 1,392,684 km, about 109 times the diameter of Earth, and its mass (about 2\u00d71030 kilograms, 330,000 times that of Earth) represents approximately 99.86 % of the total mass of the solar system. The sun is the largest celestial body in the Milky Way galaxy, which is even 10 times the size of the largest planet in the solar system, Jupiter. Chemically, about three-quarters of the sun's mass is composed of hydrogen, while the remainder is predominantly helium. The rest of the mass (1.69%, equivalent to 5,629 times the mass of Earth) consists of heavy elements such as oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron. The sun formed about 4.6 billion years ago due to the gravitational decay of a region within a large molecular cloud. Most of the matter gathered in the center, while the rest flattened out into the circulating disk that would become the solar system. Its central mass gets hotter and denser and eventually starts thermonuclear fusion in its core. It is thought that nearly all other stars formed by a similar process. The classification of sun stars, based on their spectral class, is a main sequence G star (G2V) and is often classified as a yellow dwarf because its radiation appears to be more intense in the yellow-red portion of the spectrum. Although the color is white, from the surface of the Earth, the sun looks yellow due to the mixing of blue light in the atmosphere. According to the spectrum class label, G2 indicates a surface temperature of around 5778 K (5505 \u00b0C) and V indicates that the sun, like other stars, is a sequence star. main, so its energy is created by the nuclear fusion of hydrogen nuclei into helium. At its core, the sun fuses 620 million metric tons of hydrogen every second. Based on estimates that all the hydrogen in the sun will be used up in about 4.5 billion years, and the sun will die into a white dwarf.",

Today, the sun is thought to be brighter than about 85% of the stars in the Milky Way galaxy which are dominated by red dwarfs. The sun's absolute magnitude is +4.83. However, as the star closest to Earth, the sun is the brightest object in the sky with an apparent magnitude of \u221226.74. The sun's hot corona continues to expand in space and creates the solar wind, which is a stream of charged particles that travels up to the heliopause at about 100 au. The bubble in the interstellar medium formed by the solar wind, the heliosphere, is the largest continuous structure in the solar system. The Sun is currently moving through the Local Interstellar Cloud (near the G Cloud) in the Local Bubble zone, within the innermost rim of the Orion Arm of the Milky Way galaxy. Of the 50 closest star systems within 17 light years of Earth (the closest star is a red dwarf named Proxima Centauri about 4.2 light years away), the sun has the fourth largest mass. The sun orbits the center of the Milky Way at a distance of approximately 24,000\u201326,000 light years from the galactic center. When viewed from the galactic north pole, the sun completes one orbit clockwise in about 225\u2013250 million years. Since the Milky Way is moving relative to the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation towards the constellation Hydra at a speed of 550 km/s, the sun's speed relative to the CMB is about 370 km/s in the direction of Crater or Leo. The sun's average distance from Earth is about 149.6 million kilometers (1 au), although this distance varies as the Earth moves from perihelion in January to aphelion in July. At this average distance, light travels from the sun to Earth in 8 minutes and 19 seconds.",

        "paragraph": "The kelvin (symbol: K; English and French: kelvin) is the base unit for thermodynamic temperature units in the International System of Units (SI). After being redefined in 2019, the definition of the kelvin unit, as stated in the ninth edition of the SI Brochure, is as follows. The kelvin, which is designated by K, is the SI unit of thermodynamic temperature. This unit is defined by obtaining a fixed numerical value from the Boltzmann constant k of 1.380649\u00d710\u221223 when expressed in units J\u22c5K\u22121 which is proportional to kg\u22c5m2\u22c5s\u22122\u22c5K\u22121, by definition the kilogram, meter, and seconds defined with respect to h, c, and \u0394\u03bdCs. The Kelvin scale itself is an absolute thermodynamic temperature scale, meaning the kelvin unit uses absolute zero (when molecular motion stops, in the field of thermodynamics) as the point 0 K. Previously, the kelvin scale was defined by two facts, namely that zero kelvin is absolute zero and that one a kelvin is a fraction of 1273.15 from the thermodynamic temperature of the triple point of water (0.01\u00b0C). After redefinition, the definition of one kelvin becomes the thermodynamic temperature change T resulting in a change in kT heat energy of 1.380649 \u00d7 10\u221223 J. The Celsius temperature scale is also now defined in terms of the kelvin. Kelvin was named after the English physicist and engineer William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin (1824\u20131907). Unlike the Fahrenheit and Celsius scales, the kelvin does not use degrees (\u00b0). The name of the kelvin as an SI unit begins with a lowercase letter (except at the beginning of a sentence), and is never followed by the word degree or the symbol \u00b0, unlike the Fahrenheit and Celsius scales. This is because kelvin is the unit of measurement for the \"Kelvin scale\", while Celsius and Fahrenheit are just the \"measurement scale\", while the units for both scales are actually degrees of temperature.",

        "paragraph": "Das Lied der Deutschen or Deutschlandlied (meaning the German Nation's Song) is the national anthem of the Federal Republic of Germany which has been used since the founding of the Weimar Republic (1922). The lyrics to this song were composed before the German Revolution of 1848, namely in 1841 on the Isle of Helgoland (then controlled by the British) by August Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben to convey the mood of the German-speaking people at that time regarding a common \"homeland\" that they did not have, due to the breakup of the Holy Roman Empire of the Germanic nation. (Vaterland, Germany is not an archipelago so it refers to land, while in Indonesia land is associated with women: \"motherland\"). He wanted the German people to give priority to a united Germany over kingdoms and various political units that competed with each other. The second verse (strofe) is intended as a lullaby of beer. These lyrics were created to play over a melody composed by Joseph Haydn which was first composed in 1797 as a tribute song to Emperor Franz II, emperor of Austria. Haydn later included the song as part of his No. 1 String Quartet. 62 in C major, Op. 76, No. 3 of his works. Since the end of World War I, the government of the Weimar Republic adopted this song as the national anthem. At that time, the song was popularly known as Deutschland \u00fcber alles, taking the first line from the first verse of the lyrics. The meaning of the phrase (meaning \"Germany above all\") is often misinterpreted as a desire for world domination, although its real intent is to indicate that there are various Germanic peoples and nations that are still divided and not yet united. But this misunderstanding was actually exploited by Hitler's Nazi regime as a political justification for its expansion. In 1952, the melody was reused as the national anthem of the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) based on correspondence between German President Theodor Heuss and German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer, but only the third verse was sung.",

        "paragraph": "Existentialism is a tradition of philosophical thought primarily associated with several 19th- and 20th-century European philosophers who agreed (despite deep doctrinal differences) that philosophical thought begins with the human subject\u2014not just the human subject who thinks, but also the human individual who doing, who feels, and who lives. The main value of existentialist thought is usually considered to be freedom, but in fact the highest value is authenticity. In an existentialist sense, an individual begins with what is known as an \"existential stance,\" namely a kind of feeling of disorientation, confusion, or fear in the face of a world that seems meaningless or absurd. There are also some existentialist philosophers who think that the content of traditional systematic or academic philosophy is too abstract or far from concrete human experience. Soren Kierkegaard is generally considered the first existentialist philosopher, although he did not use the term existentialism. He argues that each individual\u2014not society or religion\u2014is responsible for giving meaning to life and living, and to live out that meaning honestly and passionately (in an \"authentic\" way). Existentialism became popular after World War II and has greatly influenced fields outside philosophy, including theology, drama, art, literature, and psychology. The term \"existentialism\" (French: L'existentialisme) was coined by the French Catholic philosopher Gabriel Marcel in the mid-1940s. At first, when Marcel applied this term to Jean-Paul Sartre at a colloquium in 1945, Sartre refused. Sartre then changed his mind and on 29 October 1945 publicly adopted the existentialist label, in a public lecture delivered to the Club Maintenant in Paris. This public lecture was later published as a short book which greatly popularized existentialist thought entitled L'existentialism est un humanisme (Existentialism Is a Form of Humanism).",

There are scholars who argue that the term should only be used for the cultural movement in Europe in the 1940s and 1950s and is associated with the works of philosophers Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and Albert Camus. Other scientists have extended this term to Kierkegaard, and some have extended it to Socrates. However, this term is often used to refer to the philosophical views of Jean-Paul Sartre. The labels existentialism and existentialist are often seen as historical conveniences because the two terms were first used by some philosophers long after they died. Although existentialism is generally thought to have started with Kierkegaard, the first major existentialist philosopher to use the term to introduce himself was Jean-Paul Sartre. Sartre put forward the idea that \"what all existentialist philosophers have in common is the fundamental doctrine that existence precedes essence\", as Frederick Copleston explained. According to the philosopher Steven Crowell, defining existentialism is a little difficult, and he says that the term is better understood as a general approach that can be used to reject a particular systematic philosophy, rather than using it to refer to a systematic philosophy. It has been claimed that Kierkegaard adopted the term \"existentialism\" (or at least the term \"existential\" as a description of his philosophy) from the Norwegian poet and literary critic Johan Sebastian Cammermeyer Welhaven. This claim stems from two sources. A Norwegian philosopher, Erik Lundestad, remembers the Danish philosopher, Fredrik Christian Sibbern. Sibbern is said to have had two conversations in 1841, the first with Welhaven and the second with Kierkegaard.",

At the top of the top of the inverted bowl there is a rectangular or octagonal shaped stick above it. Stupa is an identity that signifies a Buddhist sacred building. In some areas of the world, stupas serve as markers for burial places for precious relics. These treasures can include parts of the Buddha, his bowls and robes, replicas of footprints, and various other materials that are important and related to the Buddha. The shape of the stupa is half a ball made by humans. The stupa form of pre-Buddhist India is an earthen burial place roofed with wooden pillars. The shape symbolizes the relationship between heaven, earth, and the underworld. In Ceylon and Sri Lanka, there is another mention of a stupa, namely dagob. In Thailand, the mention of the name of the stupa is called a cedi. A researcher named Nitin Kumar said that the stupa was made with the five cosmic elements that make up the universe, namely earth, water, fire, air and space. Apart from the cosmic element, the physical form of the Buddha is also represented in the form of a stupa. The stupa depicts the base of the stupa which represents the Buddha's feet, the dome of the stupa is part of the Buddha's body, and the head is shown in the form of a cube between the dome and the top of the stupa's cone. In ancient India, the stupa building was used as a tomb, a place to store the ashes of nobles or certain figures. Among Buddhists, a stupa is a place to store relics of the Buddha. After death and then cremated, the remains in the form of crystals which are also known as relics or sarira are kept in eight separate stupas which were erected in North India. During its development, the stupa became a symbol of Buddhism.",

So etymologically gerontology can be defined as the science of the elderly (elderly). Although it sounds simple and short, this definition has a very broad scope because the problem of aging is motivated by various factors and aspects and affects many areas and aspects of life. Because of this, gerontologists (gerontologists) have very diverse scientific backgrounds. They are researchers and practitioners in the fields of biology, medicine, psychology, criminology, sociology, economics, anthropology, law, social politics and various other disciplines. Gerontologists apply their knowledge and all the knowledge they have to help the elderly live a good, prosperous and happy life. They conduct training for the elderly; educating the general public to participate in encouraging and facilitating the elderly to remain active and productive; Conduct counseling on good ways to care for the elderly; advocating the creation of public policies that accommodate the rights of the elderly and the creation of laws that guarantee protection for the elderly. The term gerontology was first introduced by a Russian scientist, Ilya Ilyich Mechniko around 1903. Mechniko used the term to refer to the studies he produced through scientific research to understand the aging process. However, long before Mechniko was born, the aging process has become a topic of discussion, study and learning material for thinkers but with less scientific approaches when viewed from the perspective of modern scientific disciplines. Aristotle, for example, more than 2000 years ago on various occasions raised the topic about life expectancy and the theory of aging of various species of living things. One of the important questions he asked about this theme was \u201cwhy is there death\u201d?",

        "paragraph": "He tried to answer this question by studying the physical morphological components of plants and animals so he came to the conclusion that death was caused by the loss of the ability to develop from these morphological components with increasing age. Apart from Aristotle, it is also worth noting the names of Galen and Roger Bacon who published writings on the aging of living things. Galen (129-216 AD) in his book entitled De Sanitate Tuenda explained that the aging process lasts a lifetime, starting from conception to death. Gelen explained that the aging process occurs due to an imbalance in body heat that will be experienced by each organism. Body temperature will get colder from time to time. Whereas the right body temperature is vital for producing tissues and organs. In contrast to Galen, Roger Bacon (1220-1292 AD) in his book Opus Magi reflected on death and the short lifespan of humans within the framework of the teachings of the Christian faith. He explained that the short human lifespan is accidental, so it is possible to improve it. Roger Bacon explained, basically humans can live hundreds of years but because of the fall of humans into sin (the Eden event) their life span is shortened. This, according to him, is evidenced by the human soul which is eternal (immortal). In addition, according to Roger Bacon, the decline in life expectancy also occurs because humans are not sensitive to hygienic factors. Furthermore, Francis Bacon during the Renaissance seriously reviewed the human life cycle in his History of Life and Death and gave several suggestions for overcoming the decline in body strength in order to extend life. One of the suggestions he gave was to take care of the soul/spirit.

The country is bordered by Djibouti to the northwest, Kenya to the southwest, the Gulf of Aden and Yemen to the north, the Indian Ocean to the east, and Ethiopia to the west. The land of Somalia was known as the \"Land of Aromatics\" in ancient Egypt. However, the Somalis believe that their ancestors are now Arabs who migrated to Somalia in the 7th century when the spread of Islam was being intensively carried out by Muslim Arabs. Most of them settled and assimilated with the local nomadic population which eventually gave birth to the Somali people today. Somalia's modern history can be traced back to British and Italian colonization in the mid-1880s. The region of Zeila, Berbera was administered by the British as British Somaliland from the 1880s to 1960, while the southern region was Italian Somaliland. After World War II, Somalia became a UN trust territory and finally gained its independence in 1960 under the name of the Somali Republic. The Somali Republic was a parliamentary democracy until 1969 before the armed forces took leadership and transformed Somalia into a socialist state with the name the Somali Democratic Republic. The new constitution was passed in 1979 and elections were held to elect the People's Assembly. In addition, Somalia also has a regular legal assembly and one based on Islamic sharia. Somalia has six administrative regions which include Mijirtein, Mudugh, Benadir, Hiran, Upper Juba and Lower Juba.",

In 1977, Somalia was involved in a conflict with Ethiopia because Somalia wanted the Ogaden region which was traditionally Somali territory because there were so many Somali tribes living there. With the help of the Soviet Union, Ethiopia managed to defend the territory and caused more than 1,000,000 families to flee to Somalia. This creates a huge refugee problem in Somalia. Somalia itself has a very small number of troops, because this country has always been hit by protracted conflicts and civil wars as well as the problem of piracy which has recently become very rife in the Somali sea area. Somalia is located from 12` North Latitude to 39` South Latitude and from 41` East Longitude to 51` East Longitude. Its north coast faces the Gulf of Aden and its east coast faces the Indian Ocean. Somalia is bordered by Kenya, Djibouti and Ethiopia. The territory of Somalia covers an area of \u200b\u200b637,657 km2, slightly larger than that of France. Somalia has a dry, tropical climate with an annual rainfall of less than 50 cm. Somalia is mostly an arid semi-desert area, although there are still mountains and low-lying areas in the southeast. Somalia has a coastline of about 2,600 km, but because of the Pelintang reef off the coast, the supply of imported materials is somewhat hampered. Somalia has three main rivers namely the Nagal River in the north, the Shibeli River in the middle and the Giuba River in the south.

        "paragraph": "Woman is a term for the human gender that is different from men. In Sanskrit the word woman is taken from the word per + empu + an. Per, means creature, and empu, which means noble, master, skilled. Thus women can be interpreted as beings who have nobility or ability. Women have organs of the female reproductive system, namely the ovaries, uterus and vagina, and are capable of producing gamete cells called eggs. Women also have the ability to menstruate, get pregnant, give birth, and breastfeed. The term \"woman\" is generally used for people of all ages. The general term for female adults is called a woman. Meanwhile, the term for a child who is female is called \"daughter\", \"girl\", or \"girl\". In Indonesia, a more polite greeting or address for respected or older women is \"mother\", or other greetings according to the local language of each region. The opposite sex of women is men. According to popular theory, the word \"female\" comes from the word \"empu\" in Old Javanese, which was later absorbed into Malay, meaning \"lord, noble, respect\". The word master was affixed with the addition of \"per-\" and \"-an\" which then formed the word \"female\". Some sources also state that the word empu in women is related to the word ampu which means \"support, support\". The word \"woman\" comes from the Sanskrit word vanita, which literally means \"to be desired\". Certain religious doctrines have specific provisions relating to gender roles, social and personal interactions between the sexes, appropriate clothing for women, and various other issues affecting women and their position in society. In many countries, these religious teachings influence the criminal or family law of those jurisdictions (see Islamic law, for examples).",

The Philippines is an island nation located in the West Pacific Rim, this country consists of 7,641 islands. Over thousands of years, these hardworking, Filipino islanders have developed a highly developed system of rice cultivation, which provides the staple food of their people. The Philippines was the most developed country on the Asian continent after World War II, but has since lagged behind other countries due to weak economic growth, government expropriation of wealth, widespread corruption, and neo-colonial influences. Even so, currently the Philippines is experiencing moderate economic growth, which is largely contributed by remittances by Filipino workers abroad, and the rapidly growing information technology sector. The Philippines is often considered to be the only country on the Asian Continent where Western cultural influence is felt most strongly. The country's major problems include the Bangsamoro separatist movement in the south of the Philippines, namely in the Mindanao region, rebels from the communist New People's Army (New People's Army) in rural areas, government policies that are often inconsistent, the level of increasing crime, and environmental damage such as deforestation, and marine pollution.

Before the arrival of the Spaniards in the 16th century, in the Philippines there were small animist kingdoms influenced by Indian culture, and Islamic ones in the southern part of the archipelago. These Muslim kingdoms received strong influence from the Malacca Kingdom. For 265 years, the Philippines was a colony of the Spanish Empire (1565-1821), and for the next 77 years it was made a Spanish province (1821-1898). The country got the name of the Philippines after being ruled by the ruler of Spain, King Felipe II. After the Spanish-American War in 1898, the Philippines was ruled by the United States. It then became a commonwealth under the United States from 1935. The Commonwealth period was cut short by World War II when the Philippines was under Japanese occupation. The Philippines finally gained its independence (de facto) on July 4, 1946. This period of foreign colonialism greatly influenced Filipino culture and society. The country is known for having a strong Roman Catholic Church, and is one of two predominantly Catholic countries in Asia besides Timor Leste.

        "paragraph": "Mitosis is a cell division through the stages of prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. The purpose of mitosis is for growth and regeneration which results in two daughter cells that are identical to the original parent cell. Mitosis occurs only once and lasts only during somatization. Mitosis is generally followed by cytokinesis which divides the cytoplasm and cell membrane. This process produces two identical daughter cells, which have nearly the same distribution of organelles and cell components. Mitosis and cytokenesis are the mitotic phase (M phase) of the cell cycle, in which the initial cell divides into two daughter cells that have the same genetic makeup as the initial cell. Mitosis occurs only in eukaryotic cells. In multicellular organisms, somatic cells undergo mitosis, while sex cells (which become sperm in males or eggs in females) divide by a different process called meiosis. Prokaryotic cells that do not have a nucleus undergo division called binary fission. Because cytokinesis generally occurs after mitosis, the term \"mitosis\" is often used to refer to the \"mitotic phase\". It should be noted that many cells carry out mitosis and cytokinesis separately, forming a single cell with multiple nuclei. This is done for example by fungi and slime molds. In animals, cytokinesis and mitosis can also occur separately, for example at certain stages in the development of the fruit fly embryo. The main outcome of mitosis is the division of the original cell's genome into the two daughter cells. The genome is made up of a number of chromosomes, which are tightly coiled DNA complexes that contain genetic information vital for the proper functioning of a cell. Because each daughter cell must be genetically identical to the parent cell, the starting cell must duplicate each chromosome before it can go through mitosis.",

After doubling, each chromosome has identical copies, called sister chromatids, which are attached to a region of the chromosome called the centromere. Sister chromatids themselves are not considered chromosomes. See also Meiosis and Mitosis Mitotic division is a type of cell division in which 2 genetically similar daughter cells are produced. This means that the two daughter cells that are formed have the same genetic makeup as their parents. Almost all living things go through the same process of mitosis, except for prokaryotes (living things that do not have a true nucleus) such as bacteria, viruses and blue algae. The mitotic cycle of a cell can be distinguished into two stages, namely interphase (resting stage) and mitosis (division stage). Interphase is the period between one division and the next in the cell division cycle. This period occurs when a cell's DNA molecule in the nucleus will replicate or make derivatives like itself. The nuclear membrane is connected to the inner skeleton of the cytoplasm, where there are dark colored granules called ribosomes. These ribosomes are rich in ribonucleotide acid (ARN) and have an important role in protein synthesis. In the interphase nucleus, 2 main components can be distinguished, namely karyolymph (nuclear fluid which appears clear, colorless and colloidal) and nucleolus (core of the nucleus). The rest consists of chromatin, in the form of fine threads composed of deoxyribonucleic acid (ADN) and protein to form nucleoproteins. In the cytoplasm, mitochondria appear, which are organelles where respiration takes place from the cell. The interphase stage is divided into several phases: 1.G1: specifically, in the G\u00ac1 stage the cell size increases due to cell growth. 2.S: In the G1 stage, the cell size increases due to cell growth. S, chromosomal duplication and DNA synthesis (DNA replication) occur.",

Teleology is a teaching that explains that everything and all events lead to a certain goal. The term teleology was put forward by Christian Wolff, a German philosopher of the 18th century. Teleology is a study of phenomena that show order, design, goals, ends, aims, tendencies, goals, directions, and how these things are achieved in a process of development. In a general sense, teleology is a philosophical study of evidence for planning, function, or purpose in nature as well as in history. In other fields, teleology is a religious-philosophical teaching about the existence of goals and objective \"wisdom\" outside of humans. In the world of ethics, teleology can be interpreted as a moral consideration of whether an action is good or bad. There is a big difference between teleology and deontology. In simple terms, we can see this from the difference in principle between the two. In deontology, we will look at a principle of right and wrong. However, in teleology it is not that which is the basis, but good and evil. When law plays an important role in deontology, it does not mean that teleology ignores it. Teleology understands what is right and what is wrong, but it is not the ultimate criterion. What is more important is the goal and the result. No matter how wrong an action according to the law, but if it has a good purpose and results, then the action is considered good. Teleological teaching can pose the danger of justifying any means. Thus a good purpose must be followed by a lawful act. This proves that the teleological point of view is not always separate from the deontological. Discussion of \"good\" and \"evil\" must be balanced with \"right\" and \"wrong\".. More profoundly, this teleological teaching can create hedonism, when \"what is good\" is reduced to \"what is good for me\".",

It should be noted that 'pseudo stars' are not stars, but planets that reflect light from other stars and appear to glow in the sky like a star. According to astronomy, the definition of a star is: All massive objects (with a mass between 0.08 and 200 solar masses) that are and have carried out energy generation through nuclear fusion reactions. Therefore, white dwarfs and neutron stars that do not produce constant energy are called stars. The closest star to Earth is the Sun at about 149,680,000 kilometers, followed by Proxima Centauri in the constellation Sentaurus, about four light years away. The stars have been a part of every culture. The stars are used in religious practices, in navigation, and in farming. The Gregorian calendar, which is used in almost all parts of the world, is the solar calendar, basing itself on the position of the Earth relative to the closest star, the Sun. Early astronomers such as Tycho Brahe were able to identify 'new stars' in the sky (later called novae) indicating that the sky is impermanent. In 1584 Giordano Bruno proposed that the stars were actually other Suns, and might have Earth-like planets in their orbits, ideas that had been suggested earlier by ancient Greek philosophers such as Democritus and Epicurus. In the following century, the idea that the star was the distant Sun gained agreement among astronomers. To explain why the stars do not exert a gravitational pull on the solar system, Isaac Newton proposed that they are spread evenly in the sky, an idea originating from the theologian Richard Bentley.

William Herschel was the first astronomer to try to determine the distribution of stars in the sky. During the 1780s he carried out enumerations of some 600 different regions of the sky. He then concluded that the number of stars increased steadily in one direction of the sky, namely the center of the Milky Way galaxy. His son John Herschel repeated the same work in the southern celestial hemisphere and found the same result. In addition, William Herschel also found that several star pairs were not stars that coincidentally were in one direction of the line of sight, but they were indeed physically paired to form multiple star systems. The idea of \u200b\u200bconstellations has been known since Babylonian times. The ancient sky watchers imagined certain patterns formed by a prominent arrangement of stars, and related them in some way from nature or their mythology. Twelve of these arrangements lie on the ecliptic and form the basis of astrology. Many of the prominent individual stars were given their own names, especially with Arabic or Latin names.

After falling in the early 13th century, the Akan tribe moved south and established several states including the first great Akan empire named Bono which is now known as Brong Ahafo in Ghana. The Akan states that followed such as the Ashanti federation and the Fante states are believed to have emerged from Bono's original territory in Bono Manso. Most of its territory was united under the Ashanti Empire until the 16th century.

Thus the Buddha Dhamma is the Dhamma realized and expounded by the Buddha Gotama. Whether or not there is a Buddha, the Eternal Law (Dhamma) will remain throughout the ages. The Buddha said: \"O monks, whether Tathagatas appear (in the world) or not, the Dhamma will still exist, it is an eternal law\" (Dhammaniyama Sutta). When man is in the Dhamma, he will be able to rid himself of suffering and will attain Nibbana, which is the end of all suffering. Nibbana cannot be attained by praying, performing ceremonies or invoking the Gods. The end of suffering can only be achieved by promoting mental development. Dukkha can also be divided up as follows: The source of suffering is tanh\u00e4, that is, craving that has no end. The more he pushed, the harder he gripped. One who surrenders to tanh\u00e4 is like a person drinking salty water to quench his thirst. The thirst does not go away, it even increases, because the salty water contains salt.",

        "paragraph": "A volcanic eruption is an event that occurs as a result of magma deposition in the bowels of the earth which is pushed out by high pressure gas. This event is associated with the rise of magma from the bowels of the earth. Magma activity that has a very high temperature in the bowels of the earth tries to get out so that cracks and shifts in the earth's crust can occur. Magma that comes out of the belly of a volcano is an erupting volcano or volcanism. Magma is an incandescent liquid that is found in the earth's layers with a very high temperature, which is estimated to be more than 1,000\u00b0C. The liquid magma that comes out of the earth is called lava. The temperature of the released lava can reach 700-1,200\u00b0C. Volcanic eruptions carrying rocks and ashes can erupt up to a radius of 18 km or more, while the lava can flood up to a radius of 90 km. The types and shapes of volcanoes vary because the degree of viscosity and depth of magma that forms volcanoes is different. Volcanic eruptions occur due to magma deposits in the bowels of the earth which are pushed out by high pressure gas. It is from these eruptions that volcanoes are formed. The results of volcanic eruptions are: volcanic gas, lava and sand flows and hot rock, lava, landslides, earthquakes, eruption ash, hot clouds. The eruptions, which carry ash and rock, can erupt violently up to a radius of 18 km or more, while the lava can flood areas as far as a radius of 90 km. Volcanic eruptions can cause great loss of life and property up to thousands of kilometers away and can even affect the rotation of the climate on this earth. Not all volcanoes erupt frequently. A volcano that frequently erupts is called an active volcano.",

Eruption of the body slope of the mountain. Eruptions that appear in cracks / faults that can extend up to several kilometers. Lateral eruptions, namely the magma that comes out does not come from the central crater which deviates to the side, but directly from the magma chamber through the crater. Based on the type of volcanic eruption, it can be classified into several types, namely: Explosive eruptions of basaltic magma or basaltic incandescent rock. Usually in the form of incandescent lava flakes and, often, simultaneously, followed by lava flakes, which occur in simple trenches or craters. The eruption is almost the same as the Hawaiian Type but in the form of a superficial magma explosion. Usually occurs in active volcanoes on the edge of the continent or the center of the continent. This eruption is strongly influenced by magma with high viscosity or acidic magma with composition of andesitic magma with rhyolitic properties. The material absorbed is a certain amount of pumice. Explosive volcanic eruptions of magma (rhyolitic). The effusive eruptive stage produces a rhyolitic lava dome. Subplineal eruptions can lead to inflammatory formation. The highly explosive eruptions produced larger deposits of rock than the typical Plinian. The magmatic eruption consists of basaltic andesite within dacite. In general, volcanic bombs or chunks near craters and are often accompanied by bomb crust or surface cracks. The absorbed material does not only come from magma, but is mixed with lateral rock in the form of boulder. Both types are eruptions that occur on volcanic islands, undersea volcanoes or volcanoes with craters. Surtseyan is an eruption of interaction between basaltic magma and surface or ground water.",

Amit\u0101bha is the principal buddha in the Pure Land sect which flourished mainly in East Asia. According to this scripture, Amit\u0101bha became the Buddha because of his good deeds in countless past lives as a Bodhisattva named Dharmak\u0101ra. \"Amit\u0101bha\" can be translated as \"Infinite Light\", thus Amitabha is often referred to as \"The Buddha of Infinite Light\". According to the Sutra of Infinite Lives or the Great Sutra of Infinite Lives (Mah\u0101y\u0101na Amit\u0101yus S\u016btra), Amit\u0101bha was, in a very distant past and possibly in other solar systems, a monk named Dharmak\u0101ra. In some versions of the s\u016btra, Dharmak\u0101ra is described as a former king who, after hearing teachings from Buddha Lokesvararaja, renounced his throne. He then resolved to become a Buddha and take possession of a buddhak\u1e63etra (\"Buddhist pure land\", a realm existing in the primordial universe beyond ordinary Time and Space, resulting from the accumulated merits of the Buddha) where everything is perfect. This resolve is contained in the 48 Vows of Amitabha, describing what kind of Buddhist pure land Dharmak\u0101ra aspired to, what conditions were required to be reborn there, and the form of every being reborn there. In the versions of the sutra widely known in China, Vietnam, Korea and Japan, Dharmak\u0101ra's 18th Vow is that any being in any universe desiring to be reborn in Amit\u0101bha's Pure Land and chanting his name even as little as 10 times will be assured of rebirth there. there.",

This openness and acceptance of all human beings without exception made Pure Land School a major influence on Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism. Pure Land Buddhism initially became popular in northwestern India/Pakistan and Afghanistan, then spread to Central Asia and China. The s\u016btra also explains that Amit\u0101bha, after accumulating enormous merit over an innumerable number of lifetimes, finally attained Buddhahood and is still residing in his pure land of Sukh\u0101vat\u012b, which is described as having much goodness and joy. The basic doctrine regarding Amit\u0101bha and his vows is found in all three canonical Mah\u0101y\u0101na texts: Through his efforts, Amit\u0101bha created the \"Pure Land\" (\u51c0\u571f, pinyin: j\u00ecngt\u016d; Japanese: j\u014ddo; Vietnamese: t\u1ecbnh \u0111\u1ed9) called Sukh\u0101vat\u012b (Sanskrit|Sanskrit) or \" Land of Happiness\"). Sukh\u0101vat\u012b is located in the far west beyond our solar system. By the power of his vows, Amit\u0101bha made it possible for anyone who chanted his name to be reborn into his realm, receiving dharma guidance from him to attain bodhisattvahood and ultimately buddhahood (the ultimate goal of Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism). From there, those Bodhisattvas and Buddhas will return to earth to help more beings. Amit\u0101bha is the Buddha of infinite love. He lives in the west (represented in the meditative position) and seeks to enlighten every being (represented in the position of bestowing blessings). The most important technique he taught was visualizing the entire surrounding realm as pure land. Anyone who sees his world as a pure land will awaken his enlightenment energy.

The word \"Chan\" itself comes from the Pali \"jhana\" or the Sanskrit dhyana ( \u0927\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0928 ). In Vietnamese, Zen is known as \"thi\u1ec1n\" and in Korean, it is known as \"seon\". Jhana or Dhy\u0101na is a focused state of mind encountered in meditation. Although semantically, the word Chan itself comes from the word 'dhy\u0101na' (Sanskrit) or 'jhana' (Pali) or 'Chan-na' \u79aa\u90a3 (Chinese). Zen does not aim at attaining the jhanas. This simply shows that Zen teachings place great emphasis on the meditation or samadhi aspect. When it came to China from India, Buddhism was originally adapted to Chinese culture and understanding so that it was exposed to the influence of Confucianism and Taoism. Goddard quotes D.T. Suzuki by calling Ch\u00e1n a \"natural transformation of Buddhism in a Taoist environment\". Judging from the reception by Han Hinayana's work and from early comments, it appears that Buddhism was perceived and assimilated through religious Daoism (Taoism). Buddha was seen as a foreign immortal who had attained some form of Daoist immortal. Buddhists' careful breathing is considered an extension of the Daoist breathing practice. Taoist terminology was used to express Buddhist doctrines in the oldest translations of Buddhist texts, in a practice called ko-i, which means \"according to concepts\", when the newly emerging Chinese version of Buddhism had to compete with Taoism. and Confucianism. The first Buddhists recruited in China were Taoists. They developed a high appreciation for the newly introduced Buddhist meditation techniques, and combined them with Taoist meditation. Early members of the Chinese version of Buddhism such as Sengzhao and Tao Sheng were heavily influenced by the foundational works of the Taoist faith written by Laozi and Zhuangzi.",

Although Paleo-Indians had inhabited this place before, the Taino Indians from Hispaniola and Cuba moved to the southern Bahamas around the 7th century and became the Lucayan people. There were around 40,000 Lucayans at the time of Columbus' arrival. Christopher Columbus' first landfall in the New World was on the island of San Salvador, also called Watling Island, in the southern part of the Bahamas. There, Columbus came into contact with the Lucayans and traded goods with them. The Bahamian Lucayans were brought to Hispaniola as slaves, and in the following 2 decades, many of the Lucayans became extinct, as the population became forced laborers, suffered from disease, emigrated, and married outsiders. After the Lucayan population was decimated, the islands of the Bahamas were virtually uninhabited until English settlers arrived from Bermuda in 1650. So-called Eleuther Adventurers established settlements on the island of Eleuthera. The Bahamas became a British colony in 1718. About 8,000 loyalists and slaves moved to the Bahamas in the late 1700s from New York, Florida and the Carolinas. The United Kingdom made the island self-governing in 1964 and in 1973, the Bahamas gained full independence while remaining a member of the Commonwealth of Nations. Since the 1950s, the Bahamian economy has thrived on the 2 pillars of tourism and financial services. Nonetheless the island still faces significant challenges such as education, healthcare, public services, and illegal immigration.

The center of the study of geography is the relationship between humans and their environment. In general, geography is divided into two branches of science, namely physical geography and human geography. After 1945, geography was more directed to social sciences and prioritized the study of human geography. Geography has important concepts that are used to understand the relationship, form, and function of natural events and social events. Erastothenes was the first to use the term geography. The word geography comes from a combination of words in Greek, namely the words geo and graphein. Geo means earth and graphein means writing or painting, so geography is defined as writing about the earth. In a broader sense, geography is defined as the study of the earth. The earth in question is not only related to its physical form, but includes all natural phenomena and processes that occur along with the symptoms and processes of life. The symptoms and processes of life also discuss the life of the inhabitants of the earth, namely plants, animals and humans. The term geography became known and spread widely among scholars in the 1st century AD. Knowledge of geography has been known since the days of Ancient Greece. At that time, mythology still had a lot of influence on knowledge about the earth. The influence of mythology diminished after natural sciences began to develop from the 6th century BC. The basis of natural sciences and exact sciences began to form knowledge about the earth. The investigation of the earth began to make use of logic. In the pre-Christian era, philosophers and historians became the shapers of views and understanding of geography.

The explanation given by travelers is still in character to compare their origin area and other areas which have clear differences. In the late Middle Ages, accounts of geography were still the result of travel reports. This report is divided into land travel reports and sea travel reports. Knowledge of geography is obtained from the travel records of traders who trade between countries and between continents. In addition, knowledge of geography was also obtained through war troops who expanded into other countries or kingdoms.

Another record that also provides information about geography is the Silk Road travelogue. This note describes the overland route from China to the Middle East during the Middle Ages. These travel notes were then disseminated to various countries or kingdoms, resulting in various activities aimed at discovering new areas that were not yet known at all. During the renaissance, knowledge of geography experienced rapid development because of the renewal movement in the fields of art and philosophy.

In 1894 B.C.E., the Amorites established a small sovereign state that also included the administrative city of Babylon. During the time of the Akkadian Empire (2335\u20132154 BC), Babylon was just a small city in one of its tributaries. This situation changed during the time of the Old Babylonian Empire. Babylon During Hammurabi's reign, Babylon was enlarged and made the capital. Throughout and after Hammurabi's reign, Babylonia was called \"Land of the Akkadians\" (Akkadian: M\u0101t Akkad\u012b) in memory of the former glory of the Akkadian Empire.

The Babylonian region remained a major center of culture, even after the Babylonian Empire was colonized by other countries. The oldest written record mentioning the existence of the city of Babylon is a clay tablet from the reign of King Sargon the Great (2334\u20132279 BC) around the 23rd century BC. At that time Babylon was only a city of religion and culture, not yet a big city, let alone an independent city-state. The city of Babylon was then subject to the Akkadian Empire, a state that united all Akkadian and Sumerian-speaking peoples under one government. After the fall of the Akkadian Empire, southern Mesopotamia was under the control of the Gutians decades before the founding of the New Sumerian Empire, which ruled over all of Mesopotamia (except for the northern region of Assyria), including the city of Babylon. The history of Mesopotamia has been going on for a long time before Babylon was born. The Sumerian civilization emerged in the area around 3500 BC, while Akkadian-speaking societies emerged in the 30th century BC.[citation needed] In the 3rd millennium BC, an intimate cultural symbiosis developed between Sumerian and Akkadian speakers, which includes the expansion of bilingualism.

The mineral molybdenum has been known throughout history, but the element was discovered (in the sense of distinguishing it as a new entity from salts of other metallic minerals) in 1778 by Carl Wilhelm Scheele. The metal was first isolated in 1781 by Peter Jacob Hjelm. Molybdenum does not occur naturally as a free metal on Earth; it is only found in various oxidation states in minerals. The free element, a silvery metal with gray stains, has the 6th melting point of all the elements. It readily forms stable and hard carbides in alloying metals, and for this reason, a large part of the element's world production (about 80%) is used in steel alloys, including high-strength alloys and superalloys. Most molybdenum compounds have low solubility in water, but when molybdenum minerals are exposed to oxygen and water, the resulting MoO molybdate ion is moderately soluble. On an industrial scale, molybdenum compounds (about 14% of world production) are used in high pressure and high temperature applications as pigments and catalysts. Molybdenum fixing enzymes are by far the most common bacterial catalysts for breaking chemical bonds in atmospheric nitrogen molecules in the nitrogen fixation process. At least 50 molybdenum enzymes are now known in bacteria and animals, although only bacterial and cyanobacterial enzymes are involved in nitrogen fixation. These nitrogenases contain molybdenum in a form different from the other molybdenum enzymes, which all contain fully oxidized molybdenum in a molybdenum cofactor. These molybdenum cofactor enzymes are essential for organisms, and molybdenum is an essential element for life in all higher eukaryotic organisms, though not in all bacteria.",

Mo has a melting point of 2,623\u00b0C (4,753\u00b0F; 2,896K); Of the natural elements, only tantalum, osmium, rhenium, tungsten and carbon have higher melting points. The weak oxidation of molybdenum begins at 300\u00b0C (572\u00b0F; 573K). It has one of the lowest coefficients of thermal expansion of the metals used commercially. The tensile strength of molybdenum wire increases about 3 times, from about 10 to 30 GPa, as the diameter decreases from ~50-100 nm to 10 nm. There are 35 known isotopes of molybdenum, with atomic masses ranging from 83 to 117, as well as four metastable nuclear isomers. Seven isotopes occur naturally, with atomic masses of 92, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, and 100. Of these naturally occurring isotopes, only molybdenum-100 is unstable. Molybdenum-98 is the most abundant isotope, making up 24.14% of all molybdenum. Molybdenum-100 has a half-life of about 1019 years and undergoes a double beta decay to become ruthenium-100. Molybdenum isotopes with mass numbers 111 to 117 all have half-lives of about 150 ns. All the unstable isotopes of molybdenum decay into niobium, technetium, and ruthenium. As also noted below, the most common isotopic molybdenum applications involve molybdenum-99, which is a product of fission. It is the parent radioisotope to the short-lived, gamma-emitting daughter radioisotope technetium-99m, a nuclear isomer used in a variety of imaging applications in medicine. In 2008, Delft University of Technology applied for a patent for the production of molybdenum-99 based on molybdenum-98. Molybdenum is a transition metal with an electronegativity of 2.16 on the Pauling scale and a standard atomic weight of 95.95 g/mol.",

The pretext, the Dalai Lama rejected the cooperation agreement entitled \"Tibet Peace Liberation Plan\" whose theory seemed to benefit Tibet, but in practice China carried out the suppression and massacre of tribal chiefs and a number of priests (Lamas) who were considered disobedient, another reason China was \"abolishing the practice of feudalism-style oppression \" in Tibetan. However, according to some international analysts, China is eyeing the mineral deposits contained in the earth of Tibet.

Especially regarding drugs related to the response of the body's parts to the properties of drugs, the effect of their physico-chemical properties on the body, the use of drugs for healing and the fate that drugs experience in the body. This means that pharmacology will examine the effects of chemical compounds on living tissues of living things. In pharmacology, living systems must be influenced by drugs, thus giving rise to the basic principle that drug molecules must be able to chemically affect one or more cell contents in order to produce a pharmacological response. Drug molecules must approach the molecules that make up the cell in sufficient numbers to seal tightly so that the function of the cell's molecules changes. Medicines in ancient times were made from plants, animals and minerals. Records of medicinal use have been made since 2700 BC in the Middle East and China. Drugs that were often used at that time were emetics to induce vomiting. In 1550 BC, Egyptians wrote empirical observations into drug therapy in the Ebers Medical Papyrus. They suggest castor oil as a laxative and an opiate for pain. They also advocated using moldy bread for cuts and bruises (3500 years before Alexander Flemming discovered penicillin) Roman physician and writer Galen (131 201 AD considered to be influential in medicine and pharmacy for hundreds of years.

Copper is a good conductor of heat and electricity. In addition, this element has a very fast corrosion. Pure copper is smooth and malleable, with a reddish-orange surface. Copper is mixed with tin to make bronze. Copper(II) ions can leach into water, where they function at high concentrations as anti-bacterial agents, fungicides, and wood additives. In high concentrations, copper will be toxic, but in small amounts copper is an essential nutrient for human life and lower plant life. In the body, copper is usually found in the liver, brain, intestines, heart, and kidneys. Copper is one of the most important metals and played a major role in human history and was one of the first metals to be mined. Copper has been used since 10,000 years ago. A copper necklace found in Iraq is thought to have been made in 9500 BC. Copper (Cuprum) derives its name from the Latin, Cyprium, which derives from the name of the island of Cyprus where it was first produced. Cyprium was later shortened to Cuprum. Copper played a major role in human civilization, especially during the Bronze Age (3000-1000 BC). At that time copper was combined with tin to make bronze. Bronze is then processed into various tools, weapons, coins, musical instruments and jewelry. Copper, silver, and gold are in group 11 elements on the periodic table and share the same properties: they have one electron in the s-orbital in the d shell with good electrical conductivity. Copper's malleability can be explained by its high electrical conductivity (59.6\u00d7106 S/m) and therefore also its high (second highest) thermal conductivity of all pure metals at room temperature.",

In contrast to the oxidation of iron by air, this oxide layer then stops corrosion from continuing. Green verdigris (copper carbonate) coating can be seen on old copper constructions, such as on the Statue of Liberty. Copper reacts with sulfide to form copper sulfide. Copper has 29 isotopes. 63Cu and 65Cu are stable isotopes, with the highest percentage of 63Cu in nature, about 69%. Both of these isotopes have a spin number of 3/2. The other isotopes are radioactive, with the most stable being 67Cu with a half-life of 61.83 hours. Seven metastable isotopes have been identified, 68mCu being the isotope with the longest half-life, 3.8 minutes. Isotopes with mass numbers above 64 decay with \u03b2-, while those with mass numbers below 64 decay with \u03b2+. 64Cu (half-life 12.7 hours), decays in both ways. 62Cu and 64Cu have many uses. 64Cu is a radiocontrast agent for X-ray images, along with chelates it can be used for radiation therapy for cancer. 62Cu is used in 62Cu-PTSM which is a radioactive tracer for positron emission tomography.

Then Hegel perfected the concept of dialectics and simplified it by interpreting dialectics into the trilogy of thesis, anti-thesis and synthesis. According to Hegel there is no one absolute truth because dialectical law applies, the only thing absolute is the revolutionary spirit (the change/opposition of the thesis by the anti-thesis to become a synthesis). \"Dialectic\" is a term used to describe a method of philosophical argument that involves some kind of conflicting process between opposing parties. In what is possibly the most classical version of \"dialectics\", the ancient Greek philosopher, Plato, for example, he introduces his philosophical argument as a two-way or back-and-forth dialogue or debate, generally between the character Socrates, on the one hand, and some person or group of people to whom Socrates is speaking (his interlocutor), on the other hand. In a series of dialogues, Socrates' interlocutors propose definitions of philosophical concepts or express views that Socrates questions or opposes. The back-and-forth debate between opposing parties results in a kind of linear development or evolution in philosophical views or positions: During the dialogue, Socrates' interlocutors change or correct their views in response to Socrates' challenges and come to adopt more advanced views. The dialectic back and forth between Socrates and his interlocutors thus becomes Plato's way of arguing against earlier, less advanced views or positions and for more advanced ones later. \"Hegel's dialectic\" refers to a particular method of dialectical argument used by the 19th-century German philosopher, G.W.F. Hegel, which, like other \"dialectical\" methods, relies on processes of conflict between opposing parties. Whereas on the \"opposites\" according to Plato it depends on the person like (Socrates and his interlocutors), However, what is in the \"opposites\" in Hegel's work depends on the subject matter he is discussing.",

        "paragraph": "Electronegativity or electronegativity (Symbol: \u03c7) is a chemical property that describes the ability of an atom (or less commonly a functional group) to attract electrons (or electron density) towards itself in a covalent bond. The concept of electronegativity was first introduced by Linus Pauling in 1932 as part of the development of valence bond theory. Electronegativity cannot be calculated directly, but must be calculated from the properties of other atoms and molecules. Several calculation methods have been proposed. Although within each method there is a slight difference in the numerical value of the electronegativity, all methods share the same period trend among elements. Electronegativity is one of the periodicity properties of elements, in addition to electron affinity, atomic radius, and ionization energy. The method that is generally used is the Pauling method. The results of this calculation produce a dimensionless value and are usually referred to as the Pauling scale with a relative scale ranging from 0.7 to 4.0 (hydrogen = 2.2). When other methods of calculation are used, there is a convention (although not required) to use the same scale range as the Pauling scale: this is known as electronegativity in Pauling units. Electronegativity is not a property of atoms, it is only a property of atoms in molecules. The property of a single atom that is equivalent to electronegativity is electron affinity. The electronegativity of an element will vary depending on the chemical environment, but is usually considered a transferable property, that is, a value of electronegativity is assumed to hold true in a variety of situations. Pauling first proposed the concept of electronegativity in 1932 as a description of the phenomenon that the covalent bond between two different atoms (A\u2013B) is stronger than would be expected by taking the average strength of the A\u2013A and B\u2013B bonds. According to valence bond theory, this \"additional stabilization\" of the heteronuclear bond is due to the contribution of the canonical form of the ion to the bond.",

The factor (eV)\u2212\u00bd is inserted to produce a dimensionless value. With this method, the electronegativity difference between hydrogen and bromine is 0.73 (dissociation energies: H\u2013Br 3.79\u00a0eV; H\u2013H 4.52\u00a0eV; Br\u2013Br 2.00\u00a0eV) Therefore only the electronegativity difference can be calculated , we need to choose a reference point to build the scale. Hydrogen is used as a reference because it forms covalent bonds with almost all elements. Its electronegativity value was first determined as 2.1, but later revised to 2.20. In addition, we also need to decide which element (of the two elements) has the greater electronegativity. This breaking can be done using \"chemical intuition\", for example in hydrogen bromide dissolving in water to form H+ and Br\u2212, we can assume that bromine is more electronegative than hydrogen. To calculate the Pauling electronegativity of an element, we need data on the dissociation energies of at least two types of covalent bonds formed by that element. Allred updated Pauling's electronegativity values \u200b\u200bin 1961 to incorporate thermodynamic data. It is these revised Pauling electronegativity values \u200b\u200bthat are often used. Mulliken proposed that the arithmetic mean of the first ionization energy and electron affinity must be a measure of the tendency of an atom to attract electrons. Because this definition is independent of any relative scale, it is also referred to as relative electronegativity, with units of kilojoules per mole or electronvolts. But usually we use a linear transformation to transform the absolute value into a value that is more similar to the Pauling value. For ionization energies and electron affinities in electronvolts, and for energies in kilojoules per mol,n 1] Mulliken's electronegativity can only be calculated for elements whose electron affinities are known.",

Magnesium is the ninth most abundant element in the universe, usually accumulating in igneous rocks. Magnesium is produced in the aging of massive stars from the sequential addition of three helium nuclei to carbon nuclei. When such a star explodes as a supernova, most of the magnesium is ejected into the interstellar medium where it can be recycled into new star systems. Magnesium is the eighth most abundant element in the Earth's crust and the fourth most common element on Earth (after iron, oxygen and silicon), making up 13% of the planet's mass and most of the planet's mantle. Magnesium is the third most abundant element dissolved in seawater, after sodium and chlorine. Magnesium occurs naturally only in combination with other elements, and it always has an oxidation state of +2. The free elements (metals) can be produced artificially, and are highly reactive (even in the atmosphere, they are immediately coated with a thin layer of oxide which partially inhibits their reactivity \u2014 see passivation). The free metal burns with a characteristic brilliant white light. The metal is now obtained primarily by electrolysis of magnesium salts obtained from brine, and is used primarily as a component of aluminum-magnesium alloys, sometimes called magnalium or magnelium.

He is the brother of Shri Bhupendranath Dutt, a revolutionary in India. Vivekananda is a person who is well known to the world as a spiritual leader who has great influence from the teachings of Vedanta and Yoga. He was the first Hindu Swami to come to the West, to introduce Hinduism, Yoga and Vedanta to the World's Parliament of Religions, in connection with the holding of the World's Fair in Chicago in 1893. Here his name began to soar and became widely known throughout Chicago, followed later throughout America . He was the leader of the students who studied at the Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and also the founder of the Ramakrishna Mission Turban which was worn by Vivekananda believed to be on the advice of Maharaja Khetri. However, some historians and researchers are of the view that Vivekananda visited Swamithope Pathi during his visit to Kanyakumari in December 1892 and believes that he was impressed by the principle behind the religious rituals of the monistic faith, in which monists wear a kind of headband during worship at the temples, in in front of mirrors etc., and Vivekananda started wearing the turban from that time on. Some people think that Vivekananda received spiritual enlightenment from Ayya Vaikundar. But all this is never listed in his works or biography. It is also said that when he was a child he was impressed by the turban worn by the train driver, who carried his father to work every day. Later after he announced to the world and took the path of a sanyasin, he started wearing a turban for himself.",

Christianity is the largest religion in the world, with more than 2.5 billion adherents, or around 2.6 billion people or nearly a third of the world's population, who are called \"Christians\". note 2] Christians believe that Jesus is the Son of God and The Savior of mankind who came as the Messiah as prophesied in the Old Testament Bible. Christian theology is embodied in confessions such as the Confessions of the Apostles and the Confessions of Nicea. These confessions of faith contain statements that Jesus suffered, died, was buried, descended to hell, and rose from the dead, to give eternal life to anyone who believes in him and relies on him to obtain forgiveness for the sins they have committed. These confessions also state that Jesus physically ascended into heaven, where he reigns with God the Father in the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, and that he will return one day to judge the living and the dead, and grant eternal life to his followers. . His incarnation, ministry, crucifixion, and resurrection are often called \"gospels\", which means \"good news\". , and the Gospel of John\u2014considered canonical (valid) and made part of the Christian Bible. Christianity is an Abrahamic religion that began as a sect of Second Temple-era Judaism in the middle of the first century of our Common Era.

Christianity has played a major role in the formation of Western World Civilization. Throughout its history, Christianity has experienced schisms and theological disputes that have given rise to various churches and denominations. The three largest branches of Christianity in the world are the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, and the major Protestant Christian denominations. The Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church broke off from each other in the East\u2013West Schism in 1054, while Protestant Christians emerged during the 16th century reformation as a breakaway from the Catholic Church. Early Christians who were Jewish by nationality called themselves followers of the way (Greek: \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u1f41\u03b4\u03bf\u1fe6, t\u00eas hodo\u00fb), possibly referring to the passage of Isaiah 40:3, \"prepare in the desert the way for the Lord.\" note 4] Based on the text of the Acts of the Apostles 11:26, the term \"Christians\" (Greek: \u03a7\u03c1\u1fd1\u03c3\u03c4\u1fd0\u1fb1\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2, Kr\u012bsti\u0101n\u00f3s) means \"followers of Christ\", referring to Jesus' disciples, and was first used in the city of Antioch by non-Jews. The term \"Christianity\" (Greek: \u03a7\u03c1\u1fd1\u03c3\u03c4\u1fd0\u1fb1\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2, Kr\u012bsti\u0101nism\u00f3s) was first used by Ignatius of Antioch in his letters written around 100 AD. There are many different interpretations and views regarding the Bible and the Sacred Traditions which are the foundation of Christianity. Irreconcilable theological differences, as well as a lack of agreement on the main points of the Christian faith, have caused Catholic, Orthodox and Protestant Christians to often not recognize people from certain Christian denominations as fellow Christians. The summary of the doctrinal declarations or expressions of Christian religious beliefs is called the shahada (from the Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0647\u0627\u062f\u0629\u200e\u200e, asy-syahadah, which means \"testimony\") or the credo (from the Latin credo, which means \"I believe\"); Protestant Christians in Indonesia usually use the term \"confession of faith\" (a translation of the typical Protestant term in Latin, confessio fidei).",

Microscopically, temperature shows the energy possessed by an object. Every atom in an object moves, both in the form of displacement and movement in place, vibration. The higher the energy of the atoms making up the object, the higher the temperature of the object requires reference]. Temperature is also called the temperature measured by a thermometer. The four best known types of thermometers are Celsius, Reaumur, Fahrenheit and Kelvin. The comparison between one type of thermometer and another follows: Because from Kelvin to degrees Celsius, Kelvin starts at 273 degrees, not from -273 degrees. And degrees Celsius start from 0 degrees. The Kelvin temperature is the same as degrees Celsius, which is 5:5, therefore, to change that temperature to another temperature, you should use or change it to degrees Celsius first, because if we use Kelvin it will it is more complicated to change it to another temperature. Example: For example: Qualitatively, we can know that temperature is the sensation of coldness or warmth of an object that is felt when touching it. Quantitatively, we can know it by using a thermometer. Temperature can be measured by using a thermometer which contains mercury or alcohol. The word thermometer is taken from two words, namely thermo which means heat and meter which means to measure (to measure). Several types of thermometers include: Thermometers that are usually used as follows: Infrared thermometer, detects the temperature optically as long as the object is observed, infrared radiation energy is measured, and presented as temperature, by knowing the amount of infrared energy emitted by the object and its emission, object temperature can be distinguished.

The Comoros shares maritime borders with Madagascar and Mayotte to the southeast, Tanzania to the northwest, Mozambique to the west and the Seychelles to the northeast. Its capital and largest city is Moroni. The religion of the majority of the population as well as the official state religion is Sunni Islam. As a member of the Arab League, Comoros is the only country in the Arab world that is located entirely in the Southern Hemisphere. The country is also a member state of the African Union, Organization internationale de la Francophonie (International Organization of French-Speaking Countries), Organization of Islamic Cooperation, and the Indian Ocean Commission. Comoros has three official languages: Comoros, French and Arabic. The name Comoros is taken from the Arabic word qamar (\u0642\u0645\u0631) which means \"moon\". The Comoros is located at the northern end of the Mozambique Channel, between Madagascar and Mozambique. Officially the country of Comoros consists of four islands in the volcanic Comoros archipelago, namely: Mayotte, Greater Comoros, Anjouan and Moheli, as well as many smaller islands. The capital city is Moroni which is located on the island of the Greater Comoros. The entire Comoros archipelago was a French colony until 1975 when a referendum for independence organized by France in 1974 was announced. The results of the referendum showed that three of the four main Comoros islands: Greater Comoros, Anjouan and Moheli voted for independence and formed the Union of Comoros. Mayotte or Maori Island is the only island in the Comoran archipelago that voted against independence from France to become part of the Comoros Alliance; the 1974 and 1976 referendums consistently showed that the people of the Mayotte archipelago preferred to remain a French colony rather than join the Comoros.",

The United Nations has determined that Mayotte is part of the Comoros, but France has vetoed a UN Security Council resolution that would have affirmed Comoros sovereignty over the island. In addition, on March 29, 2009 the citizens of Mayotte approved a referendum passed in 2011 to change Mayotte's status as an overseas department of France and part of the European Union. The President of the Comoros himself rejected the results of this referendum. The first inhabitants to occupy the Comoros Islands are thought to have been residents, fishermen, and traders from Africa and Austronesia, who traveled by boat. They came to the Comoros around the sixth century AD, the earliest recorded history in the form of known archaeological traces found in Anjouan. So that the Comoros is occupied by residents from various regions on the coast of Africa, the Persian Gulf, Indonesia and Madagascar. In the 10th century, the first Arab traders had brought Islamic influence to the islands of the Comoros.

        "paragraph": "Vulva or puki or pharynx is the external genitalia of female mammals. This article deals with the human genitalia, although their structure is similar for other mammals. The vulva (Latin: covering, covering) consists of the external female sex organs. The parts of the vulva include the mons pubis, labia majora, labia minora, clitoris, bulb of vestibule (vestibulum bulge), vulvar vestibule, urinary meatus, Bartholin's glands (which are larger) and Skene's glands (lesser vestibular glands), and vaginal opening. The urinary meatus (opening of the urethra) is also visible as it opens to the vulvar vestibule. Other features of the vulva include: pudendal fissures, sebaceous glands, urogenital triangle (anterior part of the perineum), and pubic hair. The vulva is the entrance to the vagina that leads to the uterus, and provides the vagina with multiple layers of double protection by folds of the outer and inner labia. The vulva can be affected by many disorders which can often cause irritation. Maintaining Vulvovaginal Health is one of the measures to prevent many diseases. The main structures of the vulva are: the mons pubis, labia (major and minor) including the frenulum labia minor, the outside of the clitoris - the clitoral hood (also known as the prepuce) and clitoral sheaths, the urinary meatus, the vaginal opening and hymen, and the Bartholin's and Skene's glands. Other parts include: the pudendal fissure, the sebaceous glands, the vulvar vestibule, and the urogenital triangle (anterior part of the perineum). The mons pubis is a soft mound of fatty tissue at the front of the vulva, in the pubic area that covers the pubic bone. Mons pubis is Latin for \"pubic mound\" and is present in both sexes. Sometimes the term variant is used specifically for women\u2014namely mons veneris' (\"the mound of Venus\").

The clitoral hood and labia minora protrude into the pudendal cleft to a lesser or greater degree. The outer portion of the folds are the labia majora (New Latin: greater lips) which are divided by the pudendal fissures, containing and protecting the other, more delicate structures of the vulva. The labia majora meet again at the urogenital triangle (anterior part of the perineum) between the pudendal slit and the anus. The outer skin color of the labia majora usually approximates the overall skin tone of an individual, although considerable variation exists. The inner skin and mucous membranes are often pink or brownish in color. The labia minora (lesser lips) are the two soft folds of the labia within the labia majora, and contain many sebaceous glands. The labia majora and labia minora meet at the frenulum of the labia minora which is a fold of restrictive tissue at the posterior end of the vulva. Despite being called small lips they can often be quite large and may protrude beyond the labia majora. Most of the variation between vulvas lies in significant differences in size, shape, and color of the labia minora. This variation has also been demonstrated in a large 400-printed view of the vulva called the 'Great Wall of Vagina' which was created to fill the lack of information about the normal shape of the vulva. The cast prints taken from the many and varied groups of women show clearly that there is a great deal of variation. The clitoris is located in front of the vulva, where the labia minora meet, at the clitoral frenulum. The visible part of the clitoris is the clitoral sheath.

Eritrea was incorporated into a colony by the Kingdom of Italy on 1 January 1890. The modern nation state of Eritrea achieved independence from Ethiopia on 24 May 1993 after 30 years of war from 1961 to 1991. Eritrea is officially a parliamentary democracy consisting of six regions, but now functioned as a one-party state. Eritrea is a multilingual and cultural country with two main religions and nine ethnic groups, each of them speaking a different language.

If the level of satisfaction is higher, then the efficiency of an item for the service will also be higher. Efficiency can be divided into two types, namely total usability and marginal usability. Total utility is the amount of utility obtained by consumers in consuming an item or service, while marginal efficiency is the additional utility obtained by consumers due to additional consumption of a good or service. In economic analysis, usability is often used to describe the order of preference for a group of goods, for example a consumer named Bambang feels more satisfied buying 3 books than buying one shirt, this means that the books provide greater usability than clothes. just now. The usability function can be represented by a set of indifference curves, each of which has a numerical indicator. Efficiency can be divided into several types, namely as follows: Time efficiency is when an item or service is provided at the most appropriate time or the time consumers most desire. Companies can maximize the time efficiency of an item or service by adjusting the performance of the production, logistics and delivery processes. For example, renting an umbrella when it rains. Place utility focuses on providing goods or services so that potential consumers can easily access them. For example, sand in a river will have a useful effect when it is sent to a city for development purposes. The usability of form refers to how well the product or service succeeds in satisfying consumers.

        "paragraph": "A supernova (plural Supernovae) is an extremely energetic explosion of a large, massive star at a certain point in its life cycle, caused by a gravitational core collapse which can emit more energy than a nova and can last for several months in brightness. This usually occurs when its fusion nuclei cannot withstand the core from its own gravity and eventually the core collapses and explodes. This supernova event marks the end of a star's history. Supernovas are temporary objects. A star that experiences a supernova will appear very bright and even its brilliance can reach a billion times the star's original light (which can surpass the entire galaxy), after a few weeks it finally dims, and disappears. For this reason, these objects are difficult to observe and study, astronomers have now made supernova searches dedicated to finding new supernovae and obtaining fast and extensive observations. A few weeks or months before a star goes supernova, the star will release energy equivalent to the solar energy that is released by the sun in its lifetime, this explosion collapses most of the star's material at speeds of 10,000 - 30,000 km/s (some up to 10% light years) and releasing a shockwave capable of annihilating the interstellar medium. This sweeps away a floating shell of gas and dust, known as a supernova remnant. Supernovas can briefly outperform entire galaxies and emit more energy than our Sun in its lifetime. Astronomers divide supernovae into 2 main types, Type I and II depending on the light curve and the nature of the spectrum, either stopping or activating the production of energy through nuclear fusion. A type I supernova can most likely form as a white dwarf that steals hot gas from its companion star.",

        "paragraph": "If enough gas accumulates on the surface of the white dwarf, a runaway thermonuclear explosion will pulverize the star, leaving nothing behind. It is the brightest supernova, and can measure distances to other galaxies. A type II supernova is the final stage in the evolution of an old massive star that is at least 8 times as massive as the Sun when it collapses. Such a star reaches a point where it can no longer generate nuclear energy in its core. Without the external pressure that this energy creates, gravity wins out and causes the star's core to collapse. The difference between the two is that a type I supernova does not have a hydrogen line in its spectrum, while a type II supernova does have one. After the core of an old star stops producing energy, it undergoes a sudden gravitational collapse and leaves behind a supernova remnant. A medium-sized star (between two and the mass of the sun) becomes a very dense neutron star, and if enough mass remains so large (more than five times the mass of the sun) that gravity collapses the core into a black hole, releasing gravitational potential energy that heats and destroys the star's outer layers. The smaller star (which is similar in size to the Sun) will become a white dwarf. On average, a supernova occurs every 50 years in a galaxy the size of the Milky Way. Supernovas have a role in enriching the interstellar medium with elements of a larger mass. Then, the shock wave from the supernova explosion can form new stars. Based on the spectral lines of the supernova, it is divided into several types of supernova: Based on the energy source of the supernova, the following types of supernova are obtained. Supernovas occur when there is a change in the core, or center, of a massive star.",

Bamboo is also known as preng or pring in Javanese, awi or tamiang or haur or torch in Sundanese, tabatiko in Ternate, and ute in Ambon. In this world bamboo is one of the plants with the fastest growth. Due to its unique rhizome-dependent system, bamboo can grow up to 60\u00a0cm (24 in) in a day or more, depending on soil conditions and the climatology where it is planted. Bambuseae (tropical woody bamboos) Olyreae (herbaceous bamboos) Arundinarieae (temperate woody bamboos) Pooideae Oryzoideae There are two general forms of bamboo, namely woody bamboos from the Arundinarieae and Bambuseae tribes, and grassy bamboos from the Olyreae tribes. Molecular analysis of the pastida indicates that there are three to five major lineages of bamboo. Bamboo is classified into more than 10 genera and 1450 species. Bamboo species are found in a variety of climatic locations, from the cool climates of the mountains to the hot tropics. They are found throughout East Asia from latitude 50o North on Sakhalin to northern Australia, and west of India to the Himalayas. They also occur in sub-Saharan Africa, and in the Americas from mid-Atlantic North America south to Argentina and Chile, reaching the southernmost point of Bambu at 47o South latitude. The European continent has no native bamboo species. More recently efforts have been made to cultivate bamboo commercially in the African Great Lakes of east Central Africa, especially in Rwanda.

However, this growth rate is largely determined by local soil conditions, climate, and species types. The most common growth rate is around 3\u201310 cm (1.2\u20133.9 in) per day. Bamboo grew on a large scale in the Cretaceous period, in what is now Asia. Some of the largest bamboo species can grow to over 30 m (98 ft) in height, and may reach a trunk diameter of 15\u201320 cm (5.9\u20137.9 in). However, certain species can only grow to a height of only a few inches. Bamboo belongs to the grass family, which may explain why it has such a high growth rate. This means that when bamboo is harvested, it will grow back quickly without disturbing the ecosystem. Unlike trees, bamboo culms rise from the surface to their full diameter and grow to their maximum height in one growing season (about 3 to 4 months). During those few months, every shoot that appears will grow vertically without growing branches until the age of maturity is reached. Then, branches grow from the nodes and leaves appear. In the following year, the pulp-containing stem walls will harden. In the third year, the stem hardens even more. Up to the fifth year, the fungus can grow on the outside of the culm and penetrate deep into and rot the culm. Up to the eighth year (depending on species), fungal growth will cause the bamboo culms to rot and collapse. This suggests that bamboo is best harvested when it is between three and seven years old. Bamboo will not grow taller or swell after its first year, and bamboo that has collapsed or been harvested will not be replaced by new bamboo shoots where it once grew.",

His influence was far-reaching on writers of various positions, including his admirers (F. H. Bradley, Sartre, Hans K\u00fcng, Bruno Bauer, Max Stirner, Karl Marx), and those who opposed him (Kierkegaard, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Schelling). It can be said that he was the first to introduce into philosophy the idea that History and the concrete are necessary to break out of the circle of philosophia perennis, that is, eternal problems in philosophy. He also emphasizes the importance of the Other in the process of attaining self-awareness (see master-servant dialectic). Hegel was born in Stuttgart on August 27, 1770. During his childhood he read extensively in literature, newspapers, philosophical essays and writings on various other topics. His avid childhood was partly due to his extraordinarily progressive mother who actively nurtured the intellectual development of her children. The Hegels were an established middle-class family in Stuttgart. His father was a civil servant in government administration in W\u00fcrttemberg. Hegel was a sickly child and nearly died of smallpox before reaching the age of six. His relationship with his older sister, Christiane, was very close and remained close throughout his life. Philosophy of Hegel 1. Freedom What is meant by civil society according to Hegel is society after the French revolution. At that time Hegel was in a society that was undergoing fundamental changes in the industrial revolution which massively created a new middle class. Civil Society is also a society where people in it have the right to choose what life they like and fulfill their desires according to their abilities.",

The State and Individual Rights According to Hegel, the state is an absolute spirit whose power goes beyond the rights of the individual itself. According to Hegel, the state includes a process in the development of an absolute idea which is marked by the dialectical development of its thesis-antithesis, the antithesis then gives birth to a synthesis. In contrast to J.J Rousseau and John Locke, as well as the Marxists who see the state as a tool for power, Hegel actually argues that the state is not a tool but an end in itself. In Hegel's logic, people must become servants of the state for the good and welfare of society itself. 3. Integralistic State In the concept of an integralistic state, the state is an integrally structured unit of society. Society is an organic unit that is not separate and moves together into a single, essential goal. In the process of discovering this true purpose, the leader acts as the head who will guide the movement of other organic elements, so as to create harmony between the leader and the people. Hegel is known as a philosopher who uses dialectics as a method of philosophy. According to Hegel, dialectic is two things that are opposed and then reconciled, or commonly known as the thesis (assent), antithesis (denial) and synthesis (union of contradictions). The affirmation must be a sensory-empirical understanding concept. The meaning contained in it comes from everyday words, is spontaneous, not reflective so that it seems abstract, general, static and conceptual. This understanding is explained radically so that in the process of thinking it loses firmness and melts away. Denial is the concept of the first meaning (affirmation) being counter-interpreted, so that a second concept of understanding appears which is empty, formal, uncertain and unlimited. According to Hegel, in the second concept, actually stored the meaning of the first concept.",

        "paragraph": "Deuterium, also known as Hydrogen-2, or heavy hydrogen (symbol written as D or 2H), is one of three isotopic forms of hydrogen, consisting of protium, deuterium, and tritium. Deuterium is a stable isotope with a natural abundance in Earth's oceans of approximately one in 6500 hydrogen atoms (~154 ppm). Thus deuterium constitutes 0.015% (0.030% by weight) of all naturally occurring hydrogen. The deuterium nucleus, called a deuteron, contains one proton and one neutron, while the most common hydrogen nucleus consists of only one proton and no neutrons. The isotope name comes from the Greek, deuteros meaning \"two\", to denote the 2 subatomic particles that make up the nucleus. As an isotope of hydrogen, the accepted chemical symbol for deuterium is 2H. However, the unofficial symbol, D, is often used. This significant difference in relative atomic weights compared to pure protium (1H) is probably the reason why the symbol D, which resembles that of an element, is used. The atomic weight of deuterium is 2.014 amu, while the average weight of hydrogen is 1.007947 amu, and that of protium is 1.007825 amu. For the other chemical elements, the isotope weight ratios are quite insignificant, which explains why no unique isotope symbol is used elsewhere. Naturally, deuterium is found in small quantities as the gas deuterium, written 2H2 or D2, but most of it occurs naturally in the universe bound to 1H atoms to form a gas called hydrogen deuteride (HD or 1H2H). The deuteron has spin +1, so it is a boson. The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) frequency of deuterium differs significantly from that of ordinary light hydrogen. Infrared spectroscopy can also easily distinguish many compounds that are deuterium, because a large difference in infrared absorption frequency can be seen in the vibrations of a chemical bond containing deuterium, compared to one containing light hydrogen.",

    {
        "paragraph": "The two stable isotopes of hydrogen can also be distinguished using mass spectrometry. The physical properties of deuterium compounds can differ from those of their hydrogen analogues; for example, D2O is more viscous than H2O. Chemically, deuterium behaves the same as ordinary hydrogen, but there are differences in the bond energies and compound lengths of heavy hydrogen isotopes that are greater than the isotopic differences in any other element. The bond involving deuterium and tritium is slightly stronger than the corresponding bond between light hydrogen, and this difference is sufficient to make significant changes in biological reactions (see heavy water). Deuterium can displace the normal hydrogen in water molecules to form heavy water, which is 10.6% denser than ordinary water (ice made from it will sink in plain water). Heavy water is moderately toxic to eukaryotic organisms, whereas 25% replacement of water in the body with heavy water can cause problems with cell division and infertility, 50% replacement causes death caused by cytotoxic syndrome (bone marrow failure and gastrointestinal lining). Prokaryotic organisms are still able to survive in pure heavy water (albeit with slower growth). Heavy water consumption is not a threat to humans except in very large quantities (exceeding 10 litres). Small doses of heavy water (a few grams is the equivalent amount in the body) are routinely used as a non-hazardous metabolic tracer to humans and animals. The existence of deuterium on Earth, in the Solar System (as the planetary probes have confirmed), and in the spectra of stars, is an important fact in cosmology. Nuclear fusion reactions in stars destroy deuterium, and no known natural process of deuterium creation other than Big Bang nucleosynthesis, may have produced deuterium in the abundances observed today.",

Its date of origin is unknown, although ceramics dating from around 1000 BC have been found within the city. This region is also important in Jainism and Buddhism as it was one of the favorite places for Venerable Mahavira and Gautama Buddha and the famous \"Atanatiya\" conference was held on Mount Vulture Peak (Gijjhakuta). Rajgir is connected to Patna via Bakhtiarpur by rail and road. Bakhtiarpur is located halfway between Patna and Mokameh. The name Rajgir comes from the word \"R\u0101jag\u1e5biha\" which means \"house of the king\" or \"house of the kingdom\", or the word Rajgir may come from its simple literal meaning, \"royal mountain\". Rajgir was the ancient capital of the Magadha kingdom until the 5th century BC when Udayin (460-440 BC), son of Ajatshatru, moved the capital to Pataliputra. During this time, the city was called Rajgrih, which translates as \"home of the royal family\". Shishunaga founded the Shishunaga Dynasty in 413 BC with Rajgir as the initial capital before moving to Pataliputra. Rajgir was also famous for his association with the kings of the Haryanka Dynasty, Bimbisara and Ajatashatru. Ajatashatru kept his father Bimbsara in prison here. Sources disagree that the royal family of the Buddha's contemporaries, Bimbisara and Ajatashatru, were responsible for its construction. Ajatashatru is also associated with moving the capital to Pataliputra (present-day Patna).

The city is divided into several municipalities. The core section \"Municipality of Copenhagen\" for example contains the Frederiksberg enclave, a municipality in its own right. Founded as a fishing village in the 10th century, Copenhagen became the capital of Denmark-Norway in the early 15th century. In the early 17th century, under Christian IV of Germany, Copenhagen developed into an important European regional center, consolidating its position as capital of Denmark and Norway with resources from both kingdoms. Various magnificent architectures were erected and remain tourist attractions to this day, such as B\u00f8rsen (Bursa), Rundet\u00e5rn (Round Tower), Rosenborg Castle and Frederiksstaden. After experiencing the effects of plague and fire in the 18th century, the city underwent a period of rebuilding. This included the establishment of the prestigious Frederiksstaden district and the establishment of several cultural institutions such as the Royal Theater and the Royal Academy of Fine Arts. After facing disaster in the early 19th century when Nelson attacked the Dano-Norwegian fleet and destroyed the city, rebuilding in the Danish Golden Age brought a Neoclassical look to the city's architectural appearance. After World War II, the Finger Plan further developed the business center and residential area along the rail line out of the city center.

Archaeologists record the dramatic adoption of Tiwanaku ceramics into the cultures that were part of the Tiwanaku empire. The power of the Tiwanaku was further strengthened through trade carried out between the cities of his kingdom. The Tiwanaku elite earned their status through surplus food which they controlled, collected from remote areas, and then redistributed to the general population. Furthermore, elite control of this llama herd becomes a powerful control mechanism, as llamas are essential for transporting goods between the civic center and the outskirts. This herd also symbolizes the class distinction between the commoners and the elite. Through the control and manipulation of these surplus resources, elite power continued to grow until around AD 950. At this time, a dramatic change in climate occurred, causing a significant decrease in rainfall in the Titicaca Basin, which archaeologists believe was on the scale of a major drought. As rainfall decreased, many towns farther from Lake Titicaca began providing the elites with less food. As the food surplus dwindled, and thus the amount available to sustain their power, the control of the elites began to falter.

Between 1958 and 1976, there were three disagreements between Iceland and the UK over who had the right to take cod from the waters around Iceland. The war is called the Cod War. There were no casualties in the war. In 1980, Vigd\u00eds Finnbogad\u00f3ttir was elected president. She is Iceland's first female president. Iceland is located at the junction of the North Atlantic and the Arctic Ocean. The main island is located south of the Arctic Circle, which passes through the small Icelandic island of Gr\u00edmsey off the main island's north coast. The country lies between latitudes 63 and 68\u00b0N, and longitudes 25 and 13\u00b0W. Iceland is located closer to mainland Europe than mainland North America; thus, this island is generally included in Europe for historical, political, cultural, and practical reasons. Geologically, this island is part of both continental plates. The nearest land mass from Iceland is Greenland (290 km). The closest landmasses in Europe are the Faroe Islands (420 km); Jan Mayen Island (570 km); Shetland and Outer Hebrides, both about 740 km; and mainland Scotland and Orkney, both about 750 km. Mainland Norway is about 970 km away. Iceland is the 18th largest island in the world, and the second largest island in Europe after England.",

Czechoslovakia's existence began when it liberated itself from Austria-Hungary in October 1918 as a result of World War I. The periods leading up to and after World War II were critical times for Czechoslovakia. In October 1938, a year before the war began, Czechoslovakia lost the Sudetenland to the Germans and Zaolzie to the Poles in the Munich Agreement. A month later, the First Vienna Judgment forced Czechoslovakia to cede territory south of its Slovak side and Carpathian Ruthenia to Hungary. In the end, Czechoslovakia dissolved into the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia under German sovereignty and independent Slovakia. After the war ended, Czechoslovakia was liberated and restored, but still lost its Ruthenia Carpathians, this time to the Ukrainian SSR of the Soviet Union. After the coup in 1948, Czechoslovakia turned into a communist country with a command economy. It joined the Comecon in 1949 and the Warsaw Pact in 1955. The Prague Revival opened Czechoslovak politics in 1968, but was undermined by the Warsaw Pact Invasion. Communism ended after its government was overthrown by the Velvet Revolution during the Fall of Communism. In 1993, Czechoslovakia again disbanded into two countries, namely Czechoslovakia and Slovakia now. After World War II, the political monopoly in the country was controlled by the Czechoslovak Communist Party (KS\u010c).

The name organelle comes from the idea that these structures are part of the cell, just as organs are to the body. Finally, the name given is the organelle, with the ending -el describing its diminutive (small) property. Organelles are units that are separately enclosed within their own lipid bilayer (also called membrane-bound organelles) or are spatially distinct functional units without a surrounding lipid bilayer (nonmembrane-bound organelles). Although most organelles are functional units within the cell, some functional units that extend outside the cell are often called organelles, such as cilia, flagella and archaelum, and trichocysts. Organelles are identified microscopically, and can also be purified by cell fractionation. There are many types of organelles, especially in eukaryotic cells. They include structures that make up the internal endomembrane system (such as the nuclear envelope, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi bodies), as well as other structures such as mitochondria and plastids. Although prokaryotes lack eukaryotic organelles, some do contain protein-coated bacterial microcompartments, which are thought to act as primitive prokaryotic organelles; and there is also evidence regarding other membrane-bound structures. In addition, the prokaryotic flagella that protrude outside the cell, and their motors, as well as most of the extracellular pilus, are often referred to as organelles. In biology, an organ is defined as a limited functional unit within an organism. The analogy of body organs to microscopic cellular substructures is so obvious that even from early works, the authors of the respective textbooks seldom outlined the difference between the two. In the 1830s, F\u00e9lix Dujardin disproved Ehrenberg's theory that microorganisms had the same organs as multicellular animals, only smaller in size. The first person known to use the term organ diminutive (i.e. small organ) for cellular structures was the German zoologist Karl August M\u00f6bius (1884), who used the term organula (plural of organulum, diminutive form of Latin organum).",

Although most cell biologists consider the term organelle to be synonymous with the cell compartment, a space often bounded by one or two lipid bilayers, some cell biologists prefer to limit the term to include only the cell compartment containing deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), derived from previously autonomous microscopic organisms, obtained through endosymbiosis. By that definition, there would only be two major groups of organelles (i.e. those containing their own DNA, and those derived from endosymbiotic bacteria): mitochondria (in nearly all eukaryotes), and plastids (e.g. in plants, algae, and some protists). Other organelles are also thought to have an endosymbiotic origin, but do not contain their own DNA (especially flagella \u2013 see evolution of flagella). The second, less strict, definition of organelles is that they are membrane-bound structures. However, even using this definition, some parts of the cell that have been shown to be separate functional units do not qualify as organelles. Therefore, the use of organelles also to refer to nonmembrane bound structures such as ribosomes, is also common and accepted. This has led to many texts distinguishing between membrane-bound and nonmembrane-bound organelles. Nonmembrane-bound organelles, also called large biomolecular complexes, are large groups of macromolecules that carry out specific and specialized functions, but have no membrane boundaries. Many of these are referred to as \"protein organelles\" because many structures are made of proteins.

In Korean in South Korea, \"Korea\" means \"Han-Guk\" (South Korea; short for \"Dae Han Min Guk\") while \"Chos\u014fn\" is used by North Koreans to refer to their country's name. The term \"Korea\" was first used by Percival Lowell (1855-1916), an American writer, adventurer and astronomer who visited Korea about 100 years ago. The name is a literal interpretation of the word Chos\u01d2n (Joseon, \uc870\uc120 / \u671d\u9bae, 1392-1910), the name of the country he visited in the late 19th century.",

Korea at that time was unknown to the western world, but in earlier times, the Goryeo Dynasty was well known to the western world, and it was from that country that the word Korea came from. Korean history spans from the Early Paleolithic to the present. Pottery culture in Korea began around 8000 BC, and the Neolithic Age began before 6000 BC which was followed by the Bronze Age around 2500 BC. Then, the Kingdom of Gojoseon was established in 2333 BC. It wasn't until the 3rd century BC that Korea began to be divided into many kingdoms. In the first year AD, the Three Kingdoms of Korea such as Goguryeo, Silla and Baekje began to dominate the Korean Peninsula and Manchuria. The three kingdoms competed with each other economically and militarily. Goguryeo and Baekje are the two strongest kingdoms, especially Goguryeo, which has always been able to fend off attacks from Chinese dynasties. The Kingdom of Silla slowly grew stronger, and eventually subdued Goguryeo. For the first time the Korean Peninsula was unified by Silla in 676 to become Unified Silla. The surviving Goguryeo escapees established another kingdom on the northeastern side of the Korean peninsula, namely Balhae. Unified Silla finally collapsed in the late 9th century, which also ended the reign of the Three Kingdoms. A new kingdom, the Goryeo Dynasty, began to dominate the Korean Peninsula. The Balhae Kingdom collapsed in 926 due to the attack of the Khitans and most of the population and its leader, Dae Gwang-hyeon, fled to the Goryeo Dynasty. During the reign of the Goryeo Dynasty, new laws were enacted, public services were established, and the spread of Buddhism flourished. In 1392, Taejo of Joseon founded the Joseon Dynasty after overthrowing Goryeo.",

        "paragraph": "Church is an ecclesiological term used by various Christian denominations to describe the body of true Christian fellowship or the original institution founded by Jesus. The term \"Church\" is also used in the scientific realm as a synonym for Christianity, even though in reality Christianity consists of many Churches or denominations, and many of them claim to be \"the only true Church\" over others. For many Protestant Christians, the Church contains two elements, the visible and the invisible. The visible Church is the institution where \"the Word of God is purely preached and listened to, and the sacraments are administered according to the ordinance of Christ\", while the invisible Church is all people \"who are truly saved\" (and become members of the visible Church) . Within this understanding of the invisible Church, \"Church\" (or the general Church) does not refer to a specific Christian denomination, but includes all saved individuals. According to the branch theory, which is held up among Anglicans, the Churches maintaining the apostolic succession are part of the true Church. This theory is opposed to the attitude of pinning the label \"the only true Church\" on a certain real Christian institution, namely the ecclesiological attitude adopted by the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Oriental Orthodox Churches, the Assyrian Church and the Ancient Church in the East. In the Indonesian Bible, the word \"congregation\" is used as a counterpart to the Greek word \"ekklesia\" (\u1f10\u03ba\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03af\u03b1), which generally means \"congregation\" or \"congregation\". The word \"ecclesia\" appears in 2 verses of the Gospel of Matthew, 24 verses of the Acts of the Apostles, 58 verses of Paul's letters (including the earliest examples of its use to refer to a body of Christian fellowship), 2 verses of the Epistle to the Hebrews, 1 verses of the Letter of James, 3 verses of the Letter of John III, and 19 verses of the Book of Revelation.",

Thus, ecclesia is used as a designation for local communities as well as a term that has universal meaning for all believers. The term \"Christianity\" (Greek: \u03a7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2, Kristianismos) is first recorded as being used around 100 AD by Ignatius, Bishop of Antioch. The Four Characteristics of the Church first surfaced in the Nicene Creed in 381 which emphasized that the Church is one, holy, catholic (am) and apostolic (apostolic). The Greek word \"ekl\u0113sia\", literally means \"who is called out\" or \"who is called forward\", and is usually used to characterize a group of people who are called together to do something, especially to characterize the meeting of citizens of a city, for example in the text of Acts Apostles 19:32-41. This word is a New Testament term that refers to the Church (both in the sense of the local assembly and in the sense of all the faithful). In the Septuagint, the word \"eklesia\" is used as the equivalent of the Hebrew word \"qahal\" (\u05e7\u05d4\u05dc). Most Romance and Celtic languages \u200b\u200buse various derivatives of this word, either inherited or borrowed from its Latin form, ecclesia. One example is the word \"igreja\" in Portuguese, which is absorbed into the word \"church\" in Indonesian. The early church was formed in Judea, a Roman colony, in the first century of our Common Era, based on the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth, who first gathered disciples. These disciples were later called \"Christians\". According to the Scriptures, Jesus commissioned them to spread his teachings throughout the world. For most Christians, Pentecost (the event that occurred after Jesus ascended into heaven) is the anniversary of the Church, marked by the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the assembled disciples of Jesus (Acts 2).",

First, economics is carried out with the aim of obtaining as much profit as possible by taking into account expenses as part of the profit calculation. Second, the benefits obtained as much as possible only require spending as little as possible. These two principles serve as general guidelines for economic action. The results of the application of economic principles can be observed through the level of efficiency which is measured through a comparison between the profits earned and the expenses required during economic activity. An economic action is said to be efficient if an outcome is achieved with the most appropriate sacrifice and is accompanied by cost savings. Economics is widely discussed in a special science known as economics, which includes sociology. history, anthropology, and geography. Some parts of economics which are applied sciences such as production, distribution, trade, and consumption are also discussed in other disciplines such as engineering, management, business administration, applied science, and finance. There are many sectors in the economy, which are then grouped into three main sectors namely the primary sector, the secondary sector, and the tertiary sector. Microeconomics is a branch of economics that studies economic activities and economic units within an individual scope. All economic activity is assessed from an individual point of view. In microeconomics, individuals act as consumers, owners of factors of production, and as producers. Economic analysis is fully carried out on individual roles from demand and supply to market structure. Analytical activities in microeconomics are generally divided into three, namely price theory, production theory, and distribution theory. Included in the primary sector are sectors that make direct use of natural resources, including agriculture, forestry, fisheries and mining.",

Ptolemaeus was the author of several scientific treatises, three of which later played important roles in Islamic and European scholarship. The first is the astronomical treatise known as the Almagest (in Greek \u0397 \u03bc\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7 \u03a3\u03cd\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03be\u03b9\u03c2, \"Great Treatise\").

Claudius is a Roman nomen; Ptolemy bore this name, thus proving that he was a Roman citizen. As was customary, the first Ptolemy to become a citizen (whether he or an ancestor) took the name from a Roman named Claudius, thus giving him citizenship. If this Roman was emperor, citizenship would have been granted sometime between AD 41 and 68 (when Claudius, then Nero, was emperor). The astronomer also had a praenomen (first name), which remains unknown. However, it is probably Tiberius, since the praenomen was very common among those families granted citizenship by this emperor. Ptolemaeus is a Greek name.

It was quite common among the Macedonian upper sol class at the time of Alexander the Great, and there were several among Alexander's armies, one of which was in 323 B.C. made himself King of Egypt: Ptolemy I Soter; all the kings after him, until Egypt became a province of Rome in 30 B.C.E., were also Ptolemaic.",

Dvipantara is a Sanskrit word which means \"islands in the middle\" as a synonym for the word Nusantara because both dvipa and nusa both mean \"island\".

In a broader sense, the Archipelago in modern language includes Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Southern Thailand, the Philippines, Brunei Darussalam, Timor Leste (or Timor Timur, Leste comes from the Portuguese meaning \"East\"), Taiwan\u2060, and Papua Indonesia \u2060\u2014excluding Papua New Guinea.

The British established a protectorate in the area known as British Somaliland. In 1960, when the protectorate became independent from Britain, the territory became the State of Somaliland. Four days later, on 1 July 1960, Somaliland was united with Italian Somaliland. The name \"Republic of Somaliland\" was adopted after declaring independence following the Somali Civil War in 1991.

Indium is very soft and malleable, having a higher melting point than sodium and gallium, but lower than lithium and tin. Chemically, indium is similar to gallium and thallium, and most of its properties fall between gallium and thallium. Indium was discovered in 1863 by Ferdinand Reich and Hieronym Theodor Richter by spectroscopic method. They named it after the indigo line in its spectrum. Indium was isolated the following year. Indium is a minor component in zinc sulfide ores and is produced as a by-product of zinc refining. The metal is used primarily in the semiconductor industry, in low melting point alloys such as solder, in high pressure vacuum sealers, and in the production of transparent indium tin oxide (ITO) conductive coatings on glass. Indium has no biological role, although its compounds are mildly toxic when injected into the bloodstream. Most of the occupational exposure is through ingestion, which absorbs indium compounds less well, and inhalation, which absorbs quite well. Indium is a very ductile silvery-white post-transition metal with a bright luster. It is very soft (Mohs hardness 1.2) like sodium, and can be cut with a knife.

The density of indium is 7.31 g/cm3, greater than that of gallium, but lower than that of thallium. Below the critical temperature, 3.41 K, indium becomes a superconductor. At standard temperature and pressure, indium crystallizes in a face-centered tetragonal crystal system in the space group I4/mmm (lattice parameters: a = 325 pm, c = 495 pm): this is a slightly distorted en:face-centered cubic structure, where each indium atom has four neighbors at a distance of 324 pm and eight neighbors slightly further away (336 pm). Indium displays a ductile viscoplastic response, which is found to be size independent of tension and compression. However, it has a size effect in bending and indentation, associated with a length scale at the 50\u2013100 \u03bcm level, relatively large when compared to other metals. Indium has 49 electrons, with the electron configuration Kr]4d105s25p1. In compounds, indium most often donates its three outer electrons to indium(III), In3+. In some cases, the 5s electron pair is not donated, resulting in indium(I), In+. The stabilization of the monovalent state is related to the inert pair effect, whereas a relativistic effect stabilizes the 5s orbital, which is observed in the heavier elements. Thallium (the heavier homologue of indium) exhibits a stronger effect, making oxidation to thallium(I) more probable than to thallium(III), whereas gallium (the lighter homologue of indium) usually exhibits only the +3 oxidation state. Thus, although thallium(III) is a moderately strong oxidizing agent, indium(III) is not, and indeed many indium(I) compounds are strong reducing agents.",

Rain requires the presence of a thick layer of the atmosphere to meet temperatures near and above the surface of the Earth above the melting point of ice. On Earth, rain is the process of condensing water vapor in the atmosphere into water droplets that are heavy enough to fall and usually reach land. Two processes that may occur simultaneously can push the air to become more saturated before it rains, namely cooling the air or adding water vapor to the air. Virga is precipitation that falls on Earth but evaporates before reaching land; this is one way of saturating the air. Precipitation is formed by the collision of water droplets or ice crystals with clouds. Raindrops range in size from squares, like pancakes (large grains), to small balls (small grains). Moisture moving along three-dimensional zones of temperature and humidity differences called weather fronts is the main method of making rain. If at that time there is sufficient moisture and upward movement, rain will fall from convective clouds (clouds with strong upward movement) such as cumulonimbus (thunderstorms) which can collect into narrow rainbands. In mountainous areas, heavy rain may occur if the up-valley flow increases on the windward side to an elevation that forces moist air to condense and fall as rain along the mountainside. On the leeward side of mountains, desert climates can exist due to dry air caused by down-valley flows which warm and dry the air masses. The movement of the monsoon trough, or intertropical convergence zone, brings monsoons to savannah climates.",

Rainfall is calculated using a rain gauge. The amount of rainfall is calculated actively by weather radar and passively by weather satellites. The urban heat island effect drives an increase in rainfall in amount and intensity below the urban wind. Global warming can also cause changes in rain patterns around the world, including a rainy climate in eastern North America and a dry climate in the tropics. Rain is a major component in the water cycle and the main provider of fresh water on the planet. The global average annual rainfall is 990 millimeters (39 in). Clustering systems such as the K\u00f6ppen climate clustering system use annual average rainfall to help distinguish climate regions. Antarctica is the driest continent on Earth. In other areas, rain has also fallen containing methane, iron, neon and sulfuric acid. Air contains water vapor and the amount of water in the mass of dry air, called the Mixing Ratio, is measured in grams of water per kilogram of dry air (g/kg). The amount of moisture in the air is also referred to as relative humidity; i.e. the percentage of total water vapor air can hold at a given air temperature. The amount of water vapor that the air can hold before it becomes moist (100% relative humidity) and forms clouds (a small, visible collection of water and ice particles suspended above the Earth's surface) depends on its temperature. Hotter air has more water vapor than cool air before it becomes humidified. Therefore, the only way to humidify the air is to cool it.

The word bank comes from the Italian banca which means a place where money is exchanged. Meanwhile, according to the banking law, a bank is a business entity that collects funds from the public in the form of savings and distributes them to the public in the form of credit and/or other forms in order to improve the standard of living of the common people. At first, the bank was a group of traders who would provide seed loans to farmers or traders who brought goods. The banking industry has undergone major changes in recent years. The industry has become more competitive due to regulatory deregulation. Currently, banks have flexibility in the services offered, the location in which they operate, and the rates paid as deposits by depositors. Banks can be interpreted as business entities that collect funds from the public in the form of savings and distribute them to the public in the form of credit or other forms in order to improve the standard of living of the people at large. Digitalization has also disrupted the banking sector by looking at the transition from distribution networks: branch offices (physical), telephone banking services (analog), internet services and mobile banking (digital). Etymologically, the word \"bank\" comes from the French banque or the Italian banca which means bench. Florentine bankers during the Renaissance carried out their transactions sitting behind a money exchange counter, as opposed to most people's jobs which did not allow them to sit down and work. According to Law Number 7 of 1992 concerning Banking as amended by Law Number 10 of 1998, a bank is a business entity that collects funds from the public in the form of savings and distributes them to the community in order to improve the standard of living of the common people.",

This is necessary because philosophically banks have macro and micro functions in the process of nation building.

In short, the industrial revolution is a time when human work in various fields begins to be replaced by machines. The Industrial Revolution started in Great Britain and then spread throughout Western Europe, North America, Japan, and spread throughout the world. The Industrial Revolution marked a major turning point in world history, almost every aspect of daily life was affected by the Industrial Revolution, particularly in terms of the continuous and unprecedented increase in population growth and average income. During the two centuries following the Industrial Revolution, the average per capita income of countries in the world increased by more than six times. As Nobel Prize winner Robert Emerson Lucas stated: \"For the first time in history, the standard of living of ordinary people has experienced sustained growth. This kind of economic behavior is unprecedented.\" England provided the legal and cultural foundation that enabled entrepreneurs to start the Industrial Revolution. The key factors that contributed to the occurrence of the Industrial Revolution included: (1) A period of peace and stability followed by the unification of England and Scotland, (2) there were no barriers to trade between England and Scotland, (3) the rule of law (respecting the sanctity of contracts), (4) a simple legal system that allows the formation of joint stock companies (corporations), and (5) the existence of a free market (capitalism).

The origins of the Industrial Revolution are still debated. T.S. Ashton wrote about 1760-1830. There is no point of separation from the Second Industrial Revolution around 1850, when technological and economic advances gained momentum with the development of steam-powered ships, railroads, and later in the century the development of the internal combustion engine and the development of electric power. The factor behind the Industrial Revolution was the scientific revolution in the 16th century with the emergence of scientists such as Francis Bacon, Ren\u00e9 Descartes, Galileo Galilei. Besides that, it is accompanied by the development of research and research with the establishment of research institutions such as The Royal Improving Knowledge, The Royal Society of England, and The French Academy of Science.

The term \"Industrial Revolution\" itself was introduced by Friedrich Engels and Louis-Auguste Blanqui in the mid-19th century. Some 20th century historians such as John Clapham and Nicholas Crafts have argued that the process of gradual economic and social change and long-term revolution is ironic.

Making compost is regulating and controlling this natural process so that compost can be formed more quickly. This process includes making a balanced mixture of ingredients, providing sufficient water, setting aeration, and adding composting activators. Compost can be used as organic mulch for small pieces of land cover, peat can also be processed into compost, compost can contain or become humus after it decomposes. Garbage consists of two parts, namely organic and inorganic parts. The average percentage of waste organic matter reaches \u00b180%, so composting is an appropriate alternative for handling.

There are various technologies for composting waste, both aerobically and anaerobically, with or without a composting activator. Composting activators that have been widely circulated include: PROMI (Promoting Microbes), OrgaDec, SuperDec, ActiComp, BioPos, EM4, Green Phoskko Organic Decomposer and SUPERFARM (Effective Microorganism) or using worms to obtain compost (vermicompost). Each activator has its own advantages. Aerobic composting is the most widely used, because it is easy and cheap to do, and does not require too difficult process control. The decomposition of the material is carried out by microorganisms within the material itself with the help of air. Meanwhile, anaerobic composting utilizes microorganisms that do not require air to degrade organic matter. The end result of this composting is a much needed material for the benefit of agricultural lands in Indonesia, as an effort to improve the chemical, physical and biological properties of the soil, so that crop production becomes higher. Compost produced from composting waste can be used to strengthen the structure of critical land, re-fertilize agricultural land, re-fertilize gardening soil, as a cover material for landfill waste, post-mining beach reclamation, and as a planting medium, and reduce the use of chemical fertilizers.

The country is bordered by Serbia and Kosovo to the north, Albania to the west, Greece to the south and Bulgaria to the east. The country has been called the \"Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\" (English: Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) by the United Nations since 1993 pending resolution of the naming dispute with Greece. Many international institutions and other countries have recognized this country with the same name, although the majority of countries recognize this country with a constitutional name. Only since February 12 2019, the Republic of Macedonia officially changed its name to the Republic of North Macedonia, ending the name dispute. The Republic of North Macedonia covers 35.8% of the territory and 40.9% of the population of Macedonia. The capital is Skopje, which had a population of 506,926 in 2004. The country has several smaller cities, such as Bitola, Kumanovo, Prilep, Tetovo, Ohrid, Veles, \u0160tip, Ko\u010dani, Gostivar and Strumica. In North Macedonia, there are more than 50 natural lakes and reservoirs, and it also has sixteen mountains that are over 2,000 meters above sea level. The country is a member of the United Nations, NATO and the Council of Europe; as well as a member of La Francophonie, the World Trade Organization (WTO), and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Since December 2005, this country has been a candidate for membership in the European Union. The first state to rule over the Macedonian area was the kingdom of Paionia, which ruled over the Axius river valley and surrounding areas. In 336 BC, King Phillip II of Macedon conquered the southernmost part of Paeonia and founded the city of Heraclea Lisentis, now near Bitola.",

The Macedonian area was later controlled by the Roman army and became part of the two Roman provinces. The larger area was in the Macedonian province of Salutaris, but the northern border area inhabited by the Dardani became part of the province of Moesia Superior. In 400 AD, the Paeonians lost their identity and Paeonia is now a geographical term. At the end of the 6th century, as Byzantine power began to weaken, a number of Slavic tribes began to enter and occupy Macedonian territory. The Slavic tribes that occupy Macedonian territory include the Draguvite, Sagudate, and Strymonoi tribes. Some of the native Macedonian tribes, due to the arrival of the Slavs, began to move to settle new areas in the mountains and in the fortified areas around Greece. However, some of the native Macedonian tribes also assimilated with the Slavs. These Slavs then grouped themselves together, where this group was named by the Byzantines as \"\u03a3\u03ba\u03bb\u03b1\u03b2\u03b9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1\u03b9\" (Sklaviniai). Byzantium, which initially had less power, began to cooperate with the Slavs who lived in Macedonia. Later, Justinian II undertook a military expedition throughout Macedonia to pacify and enlist the Macedonian Slavs to cooperate with the Byzantines. After this expedition, many Slavs in Macedonia moved to Anatolia to become part of the army of the Byzantine Empire. Although many Slavic peoples were subject to Byzantine rule, many tribes were still free from Byzantine rule. These tribes live separately, and do not create a power that unites the tribes. Around 850 AD, the First Bulgarian Kingdom invaded Macedonian territory and it went very smoothly, because the Byzantine power in Macedonia was very weak and also influenced by the willingness of the Slavic tribes to join the Bulgarian First Kingdom.",

He was accused of being a traitor and then sent into exile. Finally, Boethius was executed in 525. Boethius' ideas had an important influence on philosophy at the end of the Classical era and also at the beginning of the Middle Ages. Moreover, Boethius' translations and comments on Aristotle's works also greatly influenced the entire subsequent history of philosophy. Boethius' most famous work is entitled \"On the Consolation of Philosophy\" which was written while he was in exile. The content of the work is a reflection on the nature of human happiness, as well as on the problem of crime. Apart from that, the work also discusses themes such as destiny, chance, human free will, and so on. Boethius wrote papers on Christian theology, supporting Catholicism and opposing Arianism and other heterodox forms of Christianity. Five recognized theological works: His theological works played an important role in Medieval philosophical thought, including the areas of logic, ontology, and metaphysics. \"The Boethian Wheel\" is a model for Boethius' belief that history is a wheel, which Boethius often uses in his Consolation. This style was very popular throughout the Middle Ages, and is still frequently seen today. When the wheel turns, those who have power and wealth will turn to dust; people can rise from poverty and hunger to become great people, while great people will fall with the turning of the wheel.

Earth is also the largest of the four terrestrial planets in the Solar System. Earth is sometimes called the world or the Blue Planet. Earth formed about 4.54 billion years ago, and life appeared on its surface at least 3.5 billion years ago. Earth's biosphere then gradually changed its atmosphere and other basic physical conditions, which allowed the proliferation of organisms and the formation of the ozone layer, which together with Earth's magnetic field blocks harmful solar radiation and allows microscopic living things to safely reproduce on land. The physical properties, geological history, and Earth's orbit make it possible for life to continue to exist. Earth's lithosphere is divided into a number of rigid segments, or tectonic plates, which move across the Earth's surface over millions of years. Over 70% of the Earth's surface is covered by water, and the remainder is made up of continents and islands which have many lakes and other water sources that contribute to the formation of the hydrosphere. Earth's poles are mostly covered in ice; solid ice in Antarctica and sea ice in the polar ice packs. The Earth's interior remains active, with an inner core composed of solid iron, a fluid outer core that creates a magnetic field, and a thick layer of relatively solid mantle. Earth interacts gravitationally with other objects in space, especially the Sun and Moon.

As such, it is one of the four basic states of matter (the others being solid, gas, and plasma), and is the only state with a definite volume but no fixed shape. Liquids consist of particles of matter with fine vibrations, such as atoms, held together by intermolecular forces. Water is, by far, the most common liquid on Earth. Like gases, liquids can flow and take the shape of their container. Most liquids are incompressible, although others are compressible. Unlike gases, liquids do not spread to fill every space of the container, and maintain a fairly constant density. A characteristic property of the liquid state is surface tension, which leads to the wetting phenomenon. The density of liquids is usually close to that of solids, and much higher than that of gases. Therefore, liquid and solid are both called condensed matter. On the other hand, since liquids and gases share the ability to flow, they are both called fluids. Although water is abundant on Earth, this state of matter is actually the least common in the known universe, because the existence of liquid requires a relatively narrow temperature/pressure range. Most known matter in the universe exists in the gaseous state (with detectable traces of dense matter) as interstellar clouds or in the plasma form within stars. Liquid is one of the four main states of matter, along with solid, gas and plasma. Fluid is fluid. Unlike solids, molecules in liquids have much greater freedom of movement.

It has a nearly constant volume over a wide pressure range; it does not expand to fill the empty space in a container but forms its own surface, and does not always mix easily with other liquids. This property makes the fluid suitable for applications such as hydraulics. The liquid particles are held together tightly but not rigidly. They are able to move freely, resulting in a limited degree of particle mobility. As the temperature increases, the molecular vibrations increase causing the distance between molecules to increase. When the liquid reaches its boiling point, the cohesive forces holding the molecules together are broken, and the liquid turns into a gas (unless superheating occurs). If the temperature drops, the distance between the molecules gets closer and closer. When a liquid reaches its freezing point, the molecules usually lock together into a specific order, which is called crystallization, and the bonds between them become more rigid, turning the liquid into its solid state (unless supercooling occurs). There are only two elements that are liquids at standard temperature and pressure: mercury and bromine. Four other elements have melting points just above room temperature: francium, cesium, gallium and rubidium. Metal alloys that are liquid at room temperature include NaK, sodium-potassium alloys, galinstan, and some amalgams (alloys involving mercury).

The reducing agent used as a reducing agent is CO gas. The reaction that occurs during the smelting process is: SnO2 + CO = SnO + CO2 SnO + CO = Sn + CO2 In the smelting process, molten slag and tin are formed which do not dissolve in each other. Slag will bind the impurities contained in the concentrate. The most abundant impurity in tin concentrate is the Fe element. The smelting process consists of two stages. The first stage of smelting is tin concentrate smelting which produces crude tin and slag I (slag). The lead content in slag I is about 20 percent. This stage is also known as tin concentrate smelting because the feed that is melted is tin ore concentrate. Slag I is then melted again in the second stage of smelting. Smelting in this second stage produces Fe-Sn compounds called hardhead and slag II with a Sn content of less than one percent. Hardhead becomes the raw material for stage one smelting. Crude tin from the first smelting process is then taken to the next process, namely the refining process.

        "paragraph": "Gypsum generally has a group consisting of rock gypsum, alabaster gypsum, satin spar, and selenite. Gypsum can also be classified based on where it occurs, namely salt lake deposits, associated with sulfur, formed around volcanic fumaroles, efflorescence on limestone soils or caves, salt dome caps, iron oxide caps (gossan) on pyrite deposits in limestone areas. Gypsum is formed under conditions of varying purity and thickness. Gypsum is the first salt to precipitate due to the evaporation of seawater followed by anhydrite and halite when the salinity increases. As an evaporite mineral, gypsum deposits form layers between sedimentary rocks of limestone, red shale, sandstone, clay, and rock salt, and often also form lens deposits within sedimentary rock units. According to experts, gypsum deposits occurred in the Permian era. Gypsum deposits are usually found in lakes, seas, hot springs, and sulfur deposits that originate from volcanoes. Gypsum is a mineral with a monoclinic crystal system of 2/m, but its gypsum crystals belong to the orthorhombic crystal system. Gypsum is generally white, gray, brown, yellow and transparent. This depends on the impurity minerals associated with gypsum. Gypsum generally has soft and dense properties with the Mohs scale of 1.5 \u2013 2. The specific gravity of gypsum is between 2.31 \u2013 2.35, the solubility in water is 1.8 g/liter at 0\u00b0C which increases to 2.1 g/liter at 40\u00b0C, but decreases again as the temperature gets higher. Gypsum has a good fraction, between 66o to 114o and the cleavage is of the choncoidal type. Gypsum has a silky to waxy sheen, depending on the type. Gypsum scratch is white, has a degree of transparency from transparent to translucent, and has the property of repelling magnets or called diamagnetite.",

The population analysis can refer to society as a whole or certain groups based on criteria such as education, citizenship, religion, or certain ethnicities. Demography is the scientific study of population, especially with regard to fertility, mortality and mobility. Demographics include population size, geographic distribution, population composition and demographic characteristics and how these factors change over time. Therefore, demography focuses on studying population problems quantitatively, such as the number, structure, composition, and size of the population so that techniques for calculating population or demographic data are needed to get good results and quality calculations. Practitioners or experts in the field of population are referred to as demographers. Demographers are interested in statistics on fertility (birth), mortality (death), and mobility (movement) because these three variables are components that influence population change. These three components are measured by the birth rate, death rate and migration rate which determine the population size, age composition and the rate of increase or decrease in the population. Demographic studies have existed since ancient civilizations, such as in ancient Greece, ancient Rome, civilizations in China, and India.",

Relics in ancient Greek times regarding demography are found in the writings of Herodotos, Thucydides, Hippocrates, Epicurus, Protagoras, Polus, Plato and Aristotle. While in Rome, one can find studies that resemble demography in writings such as Cicero, Seneca, Pliny the elder, Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus, Cato, and Columella. In the Middle Ages many Christian thinkers provided classical ideas about demography, such as William from Conches, Bartholomew from Lucca, William from Auvergne, and William from Pagula, as well as Muslim scientists such as Ibn Khaldun. The earliest study of demography in the modern age is John of Graunt's book Natural and Political Observations Made upon the Bills of Mortality, published in 1662. It contains an early form of a table of life. Some of the data contained in the book is data such as a third of children in London died before their sixteenth birthday. Later mathematicians, such as Edmond Halley, developed these life tables as the mathematical basis for life insurance. In 1755, Benjamin Franklin published his essay Observations Concerning the Improvement of Mankind, Peopling of Countries, etc., which illustrated the exponential growth in the British colonies. His work was further scrutinized by Thomas Robert Malthus, who wrote in the late 18th century. He contributed to the idea that if population growth is not controlled, it will tend to outstrip growth in food production, leading to ever-increasing hunger and poverty. The 1860s to 1910s were a transitional period in which demography emerged from the field of statistics as a separate study. This period also gave rise to a number of demographers such as Adolphe Qu\u00e9telet (1796\u20131874), William Farr (1807\u20131883), Louis-Adolphe Bertillon (1821\u20131883) and his son Jacques (1851\u20131922), Joseph K\u00f6r\u00f6si (1844\u20131906) , Anders Nicolas Kaier (1838\u20131919), Richard B\u00f6ckh (1824\u20131907), Mile Durkheim (1858-1917), Wilhelm Lexis (1837\u20131914), and Luigi Bodio (1840-1920) who contributed to the development of demographics and tools methods and techniques of demographic analysis.",

People who specialize in hydrology are called hydrologists, working in the fields of earth sciences and environmental sciences, as well as civil and environmental engineering. Chemistry Astronomy Earth Sciences Health Sciences The study of hydrology includes hydrometeorology (water in the air and is in the form of gas), potamology (surface runoff), limnology (surface water that is relatively calm such as lakes; reservoirs) geohydrology (groundwater), and cryology (water solid state such as ice and snow) and water quality. Hydrological research also has further uses for environmental engineering, environmental policy, and planning. Hydrology also studies rain behavior, especially including the return period of rainfall because it is related to flood calculations and plans for every civil engineering building including weirs, dams and bridges. Groundwater is water below the earth's surface that is normally pumped for use as drinking water. Groundwater hydrology (hydrogeology) considers the measurement of groundwater flow and solute transport. Problems in describing saturated zones include characterizing aquifers in terms of flow direction, groundwater pressure, and based on groundwater depth estimation. Measurements here can be made using a piezometer. Aquifers are also described in terms of hydraulic conductivity, storage and transmissivity. There are a number of geophysical methods to characterize aquifers. In addition, there are also problems in characterizing the unsaturated zone (vadose zone). Infiltration is the process by which water enters the soil. Some of the water is absorbed, while the rest experiences percolation toward the groundwater table. The maximum rate of absorption of water by the soil, called the infiltration capacity, is affected by several factors.",

        "paragraph": "Saturated soil layers slow down the absorption rate in proportion to the thickness of the layer, while the water above the soil provides the driving force (hydraulic head). Compaction reduces porosity and reduces the size of the soil pores which also results in slower infiltration. Dry soil accelerates infiltration due to capillary action. This property will be weaker as the wetter soil. High temperatures reduce the viscosity thereby accelerating infiltration. Soil moisture can be measured by means of a capacitance probe, time domain reflectometer or tensiometer. There are also other methods that can be used, namely solute sampling and geophysical methods. The study of water quality in hydrology is related to organic and inorganic compounds, including dissolved and sedimentary materials. In addition, water quality is also affected by the interaction of dissolved oxygen with inorganic materials and various chemical transformations that may occur. Water quality measurement can use in-situ methods, which are carried out by on-site analysis, often also automatically. It can also be done by laboratory-based analysis which can include bacteriological analysis of water. In studying hydrological processes, remote sensing can be used to gather information at remote locations. Remote sensing can also be used to measure several variables that affect the water balance on the Earth's surface, such as groundwater storage, soil moisture, precipitation, evapotranspiration and rain. Instruments used for remote sensing include ground, air and satellite based sensors. Precipitation is any product of condensation of water vapor in the atmosphere. Precipitation can be measured in various ways. To measure the nature of precipitation at short time intervals, a disdrometer can be used. Radar can be used to determine cloud characteristics, predict rainfall, and detect hail and snow.",

Sorikkun tells and sings stories about love, virtue, loyalty, and various moral values \u200b\u200bwhich are summarized in 5 pansori songs (pansori madang). Pansori was registered as a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity on 7 November 2003 by UNESCO. Pansori was born among the lower classes of the people during the Joseon Dynasty's rule of the Korean peninsula in the late 17th century (1690's). Entertainment for the common people performed in the open in the center of the crowd called nori-pan or gut-pan. Those who perform at the nori-pan are groups of wandering entertainers who perform various performing arts (pan-gut/pan-noreum) such as acrobatics, percussion music, puppetry, tightrope walking and singing stories. Because it was popular among the crowd (pan), the art of singing (sori) performed by these nomads gradually became known as pansori. This music genre then separated itself from other performing arts and the singers began to perform everywhere. At the beginning of the 19th century, pansori singers were well known not only among the common people, but were also favored by royalty and kings. When Heungseon Daewongun held a celebration party for the construction of Gyeonghoe Pavilion at Gyeongbok Palace, he invited the first female pansori singer named Jin Chae-seon. When Emperor Sunjong was forbidden to invite pansori singers, he would call and ask them to sing over the phone. During the period of the Japanese Occupation of Korea, pansori was banned and nearly extinct. Preservation is continued through teaching between teachers and students. William \u00c4son Grebst, a journalist from Sweden, wrote that during the colonial period, all publishing and publications were banned to suppress nationalism, but that could not compete with the ability of artists and pansori singers in Joseon who could memorize all the contents of books and retell them to the people.",

The stories performed in pansori are taken from folk tales that are passed down by word of mouth, so pansori is credited with preserving Korean folk storytelling traditions from ancient times, which were often not written down in scripts or lost. The stories that were made popular because they raised themes that were the hopes of commoners in the past, such as love of different statuses, justice, prosperity, filial piety and loyalty. At present only 5 stories survive, including: According to Sin Jae-hyo, one of the figures who popularized pansori in the 19th century, there are 4 requirements to become a pansori singer, namely: All requirements to become a pansori singer are easy to obtain except deugeum, which is the hardest challenge to become pansori myeongchang (master). Deugeum which means \"to reach or get a sound\" is obtained by practicing it for a long time.

Antimony is a metalloid and has four allotropic forms. The stable form of antimony is a blue-white metal. Yellow and black antimony is an unstable metal. Antimony is used as a fire retardant in paints, ceramics, electronics and rubber. Antimony is a silvery-white, brittle crystalline solid element. Electrical conductivity (conductivity) and heat is weak. This substance sublimes (evaporates from the solid phase) at low temperatures. As a metalloid, antimony resembles a metal in its physical appearance but reacts chemically differently from a true metal. Antimony is used in the semiconductor industry in the production of diodes and infrared detectors. As an alloy, this pseudo metal increases the mechanical strength of the material. The most important use of antimony is as a lead booster for batteries. Other uses are anti-scratch mixtures, matches, medicines, and pipes. Antimony oxides and sulfides, sodium antimonate, and antimony trichloride are used in the manufacture of refractory compounds, ceramics, glass, and paints. Natural antimony sulfide (stibnite) is known to have been used as a medicine and cosmetic in Biblical times. Antimony and its compounds are toxic (poisonous). Clinically, the symptoms of antimony poisoning are similar to those of arsenic poisoning. In low doses, antimony causes headaches and depression. In high doses, antimony will result in death within days. At high temperatures, antimony can sometimes act as a catalyst, helping the breakdown of chemical compounds into their original chemical elements, especially in compounds that have a relatively high melting temperature or high ignition temperature, for example decomposing thinner from anti-scratch materials in metal paint or decomposing alcohol from brake fluids or lubricating fluids. .",

In December 2015, this element was designated as one of four new elements by the Joint Working Party of IUPAC and IUPAP. The element's name was formalized on November 28, 2016. The element is named after nuclear physicist Yuri Oganessian, in keeping with the tradition of naming new elements after scientists. Yuri Oganessian is credited with discovering the heaviest elements on the periodic table. Oganesson is one of two elements named after people who were still alive at the time of the element's naming, the other being seaborgium. Oganesson has the highest atomic number and atomic mass of all known elements. The oganesson atom is radioactive and unstable; hence since 2005, only five (possibly six) 294Og atoms have been detected. As a result, very few of the properties of organesson can be investigated experimentally. The predictions of the properties of these elements were made through theoretical calculations, which discovered some surprising properties. For example, even though oganesson is a member of group VIIIA \u2013 the first synthetic element of this group which is often called the noble gas \u2013 it is possible that this element is quite reactive, unlike the other noble gas elements. Initially, organeson was thought to be a gas under normal conditions but now the element is predicted to be a metal due to relativistic effects.

After that, Aristid von Grosse wrote an article in 1965 predicting the properties that element 118 might have. Bohr's and van Grosse's predictions were highly speculative, because the method of elemental synthesis was not known in 1922, and there was no theory of \"islands of stability\" for the heavy elements until 1965. The element was synthesized in 2002 (80 years after Bohr's prediction), and at that time its chemical properties had not been investigated so it was not known whether it really behaved like a noble gas as predicted. In late 1998, Polish physicist Robert Smola\u0144czuk wrote calculations on the fusion of atomic nuclei for the synthesis of superheavy atoms, including oganesons. According to his calculations, it was possible that oganesson could be prepared by fusing lead with krypton under tightly controlled conditions. He also predicts that the chance of this reaction occurring will be almost the same as the chance of a lead and chromium fusion reaction that previously succeeded in synthesizing element 106, seaborgium. This calculation contradicts previous predictions that the chances of a fusion reaction involving lead or bismuth would decrease exponentially as the atomic number of the products of the fusion reaction increased. In late 1998, researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory used Smola\u0144czuk's predictions and reported the discovery of the elements livermorium and oganesson in the journal Physical Review Letters, soon after these results were reported in the journal Science.

Various traditions in philosophy, religion, psychology, and cognitive science have attempted to understand the mind and its properties. The main problems related to the mind are related to the brain and nervous system, which are commonly called mind-body problems. Various approaches have been proposed, such as dualism which holds that the mind is separate from the body and physicalism which emphasizes that the mind originates from and is reducible to physical phenomena such as neurological processes. Another problem is related to the existence of a mind like that of animals or artificial intelligence. Some important philosophers of mind are Plato, Descartes, Leibniz, Kant, Martin Heidegger, John Searle, and Daniel Dennett. Psychologists such as Sigmund Freud and William James have also developed influential theories of the human mind. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, cognitive science developed and led to the emergence of various new approaches. Mind or mentality is usually contrasted with body, matter, or physicality. This problem of the nature of contrast and in particular the relationship between mind and brain is called the mind-body problem. Traditional viewpoints include dualism and idealism, which regard the mind as non-physical. Modern views often center on physicalism and functionalism, which argue that the mind is roughly identical to the brain or can be reduced to physical phenomena such as neural activity. Psychologists such as Freud and James, and computer scientists such as Turing developed influential theories about the nature of the mind.

This is because an idea presented to such a mind will, on average, elicit less than one idea in response, but a small proportion are highly critical. The real mind must be peeled deep to get the core idea of \u200b\u200bone's mind. Budi or mind comes from the Old English word gemynd meaning the ability to remember, not to think in general. Old English had other words for \"mind,\" such as hyge \"mind, spirit.\" The generalization of the meaning of mind or mind, that is to include all mental faculties, thought, will, feeling, and memory, gradually developed during the 14th and 15th centuries. Mind or mind is often understood as an ability that manifests itself in mental phenomena such as sensation, perception, thinking, reasoning, memory, belief, will, emotion and motivation. Mind or mentality is usually contrasted with the body, material or physical. Central to this contrast is the intuition that the mind exhibits various features which are not found and perhaps even do not correspond to the material universe as described by natural science. In the traditionally dominant substantialist view associated with Ren\u00e9 Descartes, mind is defined as an independent thinking substance. However, it is more common in contemporary philosophy to understand mind not as a substance, but as a trait or capacity possessed by humans and the higher animals. Despite this agreement, there are still many differences of opinion regarding the true nature of mind and various competing definitions have been proposed. Philosophical definitions of the mind are usually proceeding not only from the various kinds of phenomena of the mind, but by looking for a \"mental sign\": that part which is shared by all mental states and only by mental states.",

A person is considered overweight (obese) if the body mass index (BMI), which is a measurement obtained from the division of body weight in kilograms by the square of height in meters is more than 30 kg/m2. Obesity increases the chance of many diseases, especially heart disease, type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, certain cancers, osteoarthritis and asthma. Obesity is most often caused by a combination of excess food energy intake, physical inactivity, and genetic predisposition, although a small percentage of cases are primarily caused by genes, endocrine disorders, drugs or psychiatric disease. There is little evidence to support the view that obese people eat less but gain weight because their metabolism is slow; on average, fat people expend more energy than thin people because it takes energy to maintain greater body mass. Diet control and physical activity are still the main management of obesity. The quality of intake can be improved by reducing the consumption of energy-dense foods, for example foods that are high in fat and sugar, and by increasing fiber intake. Anti-obesity drugs can be taken to reduce appetite or inhibit fat absorption, accompanied by proper dietary intake. If diet, exercise, and medication are not effective, gastric balloons can help reduce weight or surgery can be performed to reduce stomach volume and intestinal length. This can give you a feeling of fullness earlier and reduce the ability to absorb nutrients from food. Obesity is the leading cause of preventable death in the world, with an increasing prevalence in both adults and children, for which authorities consider obesity to be one of the most serious public health problems of the 21st century.",

Unlike in developed countries, most are men, in Indonesia, most are women who are fat. Obesity is a medical condition in the form of excess body fat that has accumulated in such a way as to cause adverse effects on health. Obesity was assessed based on body mass index (BMI), and then based on fat distribution through waist-to-hip ratio and total cardiovascular risk factors. BMI is closely related to body fat percentage and total body fat. In children, a healthy weight varies by age and sex. Obesity in children and adolescents is not defined by an absolute number, but is related to a history of groups with normal weight, obesity is defined when BMI is greater than the 95th percentile. The reference data on which these percentiles are based are from 1963 to 1994, and therefore have not been affected by recent weight gains. BMI is calculated by dividing a subject's weight by the square of their height, which is usually written in either metric units or in the American system: lb{\\displaystyle lb} is the subject's weight in pounds and in{\\displaystyle in} is the subject's height in inches .

The ferrous metal in steel is combined with several other elements, including carbon to modify its characteristics. Some common metals used as alloys are Nickel, Manganese, Aluminum, and Bismuth. Other elements that are used less frequently include Titanium, Vanadium, Chromium, Tungsten, Molybdenum, Boron, and Niobium. The ratio of steel constituents will affect the properties and characteristics of the steel itself. Elemental Carbon (C) is usually added to steel to increase its strength. Carbon in steel causes the strength of steel to increase but carbon also causes the elasticity of steel to decrease. The elemental carbon content of steel ranges from 0.2% to 2.1% by weight. Too much percentage of carbon will cause the steel to become brittle or break easily. Iron can be formed into two crystal forms, namely Body Center Cubic (BCC) and Face Center Cubic (FCC), depending on the temperature at which it is forged. In the BCC arrangement, there is an iron atom in the center of the atomic cube, and the FCC arrangement has iron atoms on each side of the six-sided cube of atoms. The allotropic interaction that occurs between ferrous metals and alloying elements, such as carbon, is what gives steel and cast iron their own characteristics. Although steel had previously been produced by blacksmiths using kilns for thousands of years, its use grew when more efficient production methods were discovered in the 17th century. With the invention of the Bessemer process in the mid-19th century, steel became a mass-produced material which made it cheaper to produce. Today, steel is one of the most common materials in the world, with the production of more than 1.3 billion tons annually replacing wrought iron.",

The steel industry is able to absorb a lot of manpower, besides that the steel industry requires high technology supported by a skilled workforce. In its history, the Soviet Union made the steel industry a priority in the Soviet Industrialization in 1929 - 1941. According to statistics, China and India are the 2 largest steel producing countries. The English word Steel, namely steel, comes from the Proto-Germanic adverb, namely stahlija or stakhlijan (made of steel), which is related to stahlaz or stahlija (standing straight). As already reviewed, the carbon content in the steel alloy is between 0.002% and 2.14% by weight of the iron\u2013carbon alloy. This amount can vary depending on the alloying elements present in the alloy such as manganese, chromium, nickel, iron, tungsten, carbon, and so on. Basically, steel is an iron-carbon alloy that does not undergo eutectic reactions. On the contrary, cast iron actually undergoes this reaction. If the carbon content in the steel is too little, then the pure iron in the alloy will become ductile, soft, and weak. The higher carbon content than normal steel will create an alloy which is often called pig iron. Although iron that is successfully alloyed with carbon is called carbon steel, alloy steel is steel that is alloyed with other elements in order to impart certain characteristics to the steel.",

The first law of thermodynamics and the second law of thermodynamics become a reference in discussing energy changes. Measurements in thermodynamics are not expressed in microscopic quantities but in macroscopic quantities. Thermodynamics deals with the relationship between energy, heat, work, entropy and the spontaneity of processes. Thermodynamics is closely related to statistical mechanics from which the thermodynamic relationships originate. The origin of the word thermodynamics is from two Greek words, namely thermos which means heat and dynamic which means change. The discovery of the concept of thermodynamics began with the efforts of scientists in the 19th century AD to create machines that had the ability to carry out energy changes. The purpose of converting this energy was originally to facilitate work by converting energy into work with the maximum amount of energy change. The earliest machines created by scientists were able to convert the energy of motion into potential energy. Its working principle is based on collision events. There was an effort from these scientists who later in the 20th century succeeded in developing theories regarding thermodynamics. The theory of thermodynamics applies to a hot state or a system in an equilibrium state at the start or end. After the 19th century AD, the development of the theory of thermodynamics turned to quantum physics and phase transitions. Phenomenologically, the development of the theory of thermodynamics is aimed at macroscopic systems. In physics, the formulation of thermodynamics becomes an axiom that includes the three laws of thermodynamics. The main concepts underlying the three laws of thermodynamics are energy and entropy. The application of the science of thermodynamics existed in the 3rd century BC in the city of Alexandria. At that time, an inventor named Hero used the science of thermodynamics to adjust the position of the gate at the Alexandrian Temple. Scientifically, the science of thermodynamics was first developed by a German scientist named Otto von Guericke in 1650.",

The vacuum pump design created by Guericke was later studied by the Irish chemist and physicist Robert Boyle. After studying it, Boyle along with an English scientist named Robert Hooke developed a design during 1656. The result of this development was the invention of an air pump which was later called a compressor. This pump was then used by the two inventors to analyze the relationship between volume, pressure and temperature. The results of the analysis between volume, pressure and temperature produce Boyle's law. This law states that pressure and volume are inversely related. In 1679, Boyle's co-worker, Denis Papin, succeeded in making a boiler that could produce steam at high pressure. In the initial experiments, this boiler produced a strong explosion, so a redesign was held. In the new design, a steam opening valve is added. Papin also became the originator of ideas in making engines that use cylinders and pistons in the form of finished designs. This design did not have time to be made by Papin, so an engineer named Thomas Savery continued to build it. The results of this design resulted in a motorbike that was the first in the world. In the 17th century steam engines were also found in England. The existence of this steam engine expands the field of thermodynamics. After that, scientists appeared in the field of thermodynamics, especially in the 19th century. These scientists include William John Macquorn Rankine, Rudolf Clausius, and Lord Kelvin. The scientific development of thermodynamics developed in the 19th century AD is known as classical thermodynamics. The approach used is macroscopic. Observations regarding the general behavior of the particles of matter which serve as media for the transfer of energy are characteristic of classical thermodynamics.",

In particular, the term has an earlier geographic definition dating back to 1832, when it meant \"a metropolis,\" that is, \"a very large and densely populated urban complex\", of which Greek origin is recorded; m\u00e9gas, meaning \"big,\" and p\u00f3lis, meaning \"city.\" The Online Etymology Dictionary notes that the term was used \"in classical times as an epithet of the great cities (Athens, Syracuse, Alexandria)\", that is, for the major cities of the time, and that it is \"the name of former cities in Arcadia\". Jean Gottmann, in his extensive studies, applied the term megalopolis to his analysis of the urbanized northeastern coastal areas of the United States, particularly from Boston, Massachusetts to Washington, D.C. (now often referred to as the Northeast Corridor \u2013 Northeast Corridor). He chose the term megalopolis in consultation with classicists, noting its earlier use \"with quite different meanings\" (other than by the ancients), by Lewis Mumford in reference to a general trend in history and geography \"toward large cities\").",

Ellis and editors of National Geographic, writing about the city of Boston, pointed out that Gottmann's 1961 use of the term northeast for megalopolis was the first specific use of the term with a subtle meaning of merging several urban areas into a larger area. big. Yoav Hagler, writing in 2009 for the Regional Plan Association's (RPA) Americas Project 2050 and similarly in introducing the term historically, cites megalopolis as the precursor to RPA's preferred term for the United States example, \"megaregion\". Pedagogically, the term \"supercity\" has been offered as a synonym for both terms. According to an assistant professor at the University of Syracuse; Lydia Kallipoliti (and her students, quoting from Volker Welter's \u2013 Biopolis: Patrick Geddes and the City of Life), the term megalopolis was coined by Patrick Geddes in his 1915 book, Cities in Evolution, and that it was later used by Oswald Spengler in his 1990s. 1918, The Decline of the West. Megalopolis is often called Megapolis. Both come from \u03bc\u03ad\u03b3\u03b1\u03c2 (m\u00e9gas) which in Greek means \"big\" and \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2 (p\u00f3lis) which means \"city\", so that as a whole it means \"big city\". Literally, megalopolis in Greek is a very large city because the prefix megalo- denotes large size. Megalopolis is also an Ancient Greek city formed by the Arcadian League by uniting small communities. A megalopolis, also known as a megaregion or in Indonesian it is called a megapolitan, is a grouped network of cities.

Kazakhstan is often referred to as the \"Virgin Land\", because some areas of this country have not been touched at all. Most of Kazakhstan shares a direct border with Russia, especially to the north and west. To the east, it is directly adjacent to China (with the autonomous region of Xinjiang). To the south it is bordered by Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan and the Caspian Sea. There are many Russians living in Kazakhstan. The launch site for the Russian space rocket, Baikonur, is located in Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan proclaimed its independence on December 16, 1991. The Kazakhs are the largest ethnic group occupying the territory of Kazakhstan and are descended from Turkic and Mongol tribes. At the beginning of the XVIII century, Kazakhstan was ruled by Russia.

Spain came in the 16th century and brought with it its culture and Catholicism, resulting in a mixture of Spanish and indigenous culture. Honduras became independent from Spain in 1821 and until now has always experienced political instability which has caused Honduras to become one of the poorest countries in the Americas. Honduras is also ranked at the top of the world in rates of homicide and sexual violence. Poverty is caused by corruption, exploitation from other countries plus natural disasters. In addition, the operation carried out by the United States to prevent the entry of drugs into its territory has also increased crime in Honduras. This operation gave birth to criminal gangs in Central America such as MS-13 which are active in the illegal drug trade. These criminal gangs have their own territory and are often at war with each other. Their activities are very dangerous for the population so that large-scale migration occurs to other countries such as the United States. Honduras' main economy is in agriculture mainly fruit, sugarcane and coffee. Before the Spanish arrived, Honduras was already inhabited by various ethnic groups, especially the Mayans. Christopher Columbus reached Islas de la Bah\u00eda on the coast of Honduras in 1502. Columbus sent his brother Bartholomew Columbus to explore the islands. Bartholomew and his crew met a Mayan boat carrying a large cargo. The boat is intercepted, the cargo is stolen, and the captain is forced to act as an interpreter. This event marked the first contact between the Spanish and the Maya.

These changes are caused by a combination of three main processes: variation, reproduction, and selection. The traits that form the basis of this evolution are carried by genes that are passed on to the offspring of a living thing and become varied within a population. When organisms reproduce, their offspring will have new characteristics. New properties can be obtained from changes in genes due to mutations or gene transfer between populations and between species. In sexually reproducing species, new gene combinations are also produced by genetic recombination, which can increase variation between organisms. Evolution occurs when these inherited differences become more common or rare within a population. Evolution is driven by two main mechanisms, namely natural selection and genetic drift. Natural selection is a process that causes inherited traits that are useful for the survival and reproduction of organisms to become more common in a population - and conversely, traits that are detrimental to them become less. This happens because individuals with favorable traits are more likely to reproduce, so that more individuals in the next generation inherit these beneficial traits. Over many generations, adaptation occurs through the combination of these small, continuous and random changes in traits with natural selection. Meanwhile, genetic drift (English: Genetic Drift) is an independent process that produces random changes in the frequency of a population trait. Genetic drift results from the probability of whether a trait will be inherited when an individual survives and reproduces.",

This process culminates in producing a new species. And in fact, the similarities between organisms suggest that all the species we know came from a common ancestor by this slowly diverging process. Documentation of the facts of evolution is carried out by a branch of biology called evolutionary biology. This branch also develops and tests theories explaining the causes of evolution. Studies of the fossil record and the biodiversity of living organisms convinced scientists in the mid-19th century that species changed over time. However, the mechanisms driving these changes remained unclear until Charles Darwin's 1859 publication, On the Origin of Species, which detailed the theory of evolution by natural selection. Darwin's work was quickly followed by the acceptance of the theory of evolution in the scientific community. In 1930, Darwin's theory of natural selection combined with Mendelian inheritance to form the modern evolutionary synthesis, which links the units of evolution (genes) to the mechanism of evolution (natural selection). The theory's explanatory and predictive power drives research that continually raises new questions, which have become a central principle of modern biology providing a more comprehensive explanation of the diversity of life on earth. Although the theory of evolution is always associated with Charles Darwin, in fact, evolutionary biology has its roots since the time of Aristotle. However, Darwin was the first scientist to come up with a theory of evolution that has proven itself well in the face of scientific scrutiny. Until now, Darwin's theory of evolution as a result of natural selection is considered by the majority of the scientific community to be the best theory in explaining evolution.",

The Indonesian taxon is tribe (used in many scientific literature), familia (non-standard form), or family. A family can be divided into several subfamilies, namely intermediate taxa above the genus. In the use of common names, a family can be named the same as the name of one of its members which is commonly known. What is or is not included in a family or when a family is recognized separately is proposed and defined by taxonomists. There are no standard rules for describing or explaining a family, or even another taxon. Taxonomists may take different positions regarding the description of a taxon and there may not be a widely accepted consensus within the scientific community for some time. As long as there is no consensus, new data and opinions will always be provided that allow for adjustments. Family names are codified in various international codes. The term was first introduced by the French botanist Pierre Magnol in his book Prodromus historiae generalis plantarum, in quo familiae plantarum per tabulas disponuntur in 1689. He named 76 groups of plants which he identified as families (familiae). The concept of rank/taxon was not yet established at that time and in the foreword to the book, Magnol mentions uniting these families into a wider genera, long before the term came into use as it is today. Carolus Linnaeus used the term family in his Philosophia botanica (1751) to refer to the main groups of plants.

Society is a group of people who are closely intertwined because of certain systems, certain traditions, conventions and certain laws that are the same, and lead to collective life. Society is a group of people who, because of the demands of needs and the influence of certain beliefs, thoughts, and ambitions, are united in collective life. The systems and laws contained in a society reflect individual behaviors because these individuals are bound by these laws and systems.

The smallest type of society or herd usually consists of only a few groups, many of which are collections of one or several large families. Society is a system that is interconnected between one human being and another human being that forms a unity. Humans as social beings need other humans to meet their needs.

The metal occurs naturally in its pure, free form (native silver), as an alloy with gold and other metals, and in minerals such as argentite and chlorargyrite. Most silver is produced as a by-product of copper, gold, tin and zinc mining. Silver has long been valued as a precious metal. More abundant than gold, the metal silver has served in many premodern monetary systems as a coinage species, sometimes even alongside gold. Purity is usually measured on a per-mile basis; a 94% pure alloy is described as \"0.940 fine\". In addition, silver has many applications beyond currency, such as in solar panels, water filters, jewelry and ornaments, high-value cutlery and furnishings (hence the term silverware), as well as investment in coins and bullions. Silver is used industrially in electrical sockets and conductors, in special mirrors, window coatings and in the catalysis of chemical reactions. Its compounds are used in photographic film and X-rays. Aqueous solutions of silver nitrate and other silver compounds are used as a disinfectant and microbicide (oligodynamic effect), added to bandages and wound dressings, catheters and other medical devices.

Silver's electrical conductivity is the highest of all metals, even higher than that of copper, but it is not widely used for electrical purposes due to its high cost. An exception to this is in radio frequency engineering, especially VHF and higher frequencies, where silver plating is applied to increase the electrical conductivity of certain parts and cables (at high frequencies current tends to flow on the surface of the conductor, not inside , therefore gold plating increases the overall conductivity). Silver also has the lowest contact resistance of all metals. During World War II in the US, 13,540 tons were used in electromagnets used for uranium enrichment, mainly because of wartime shortages of copper. Pure silver has the highest thermal conductivity of all metals, although the non-metallic carbon in the diamond form and the superfluid helium-4 are higher. Silver halides are photosensitive and have the amazing ability to record latent images which can then be developed chemically. Silver is stable in pure air and water, but tarnishes when exposed to air or water containing ozone or hydrogen sulfide, the latter forming a black layer of silver sulfide, which can be removed with dilute hydrochloric acid. The most common oxidation state of silver is +1 (eg, silver nitrate, AgNO); less common are +2 compounds (for example, silver(II) fluoride, AgF), even less common are +3 (for example, potassium tetrafluoroargentate(III), KAgF), and even +4 compounds (for example, potassium hexafluoroargentate( IV), K).",

In short it can also be said that genetics is the science of genes and all its aspects. The term \"genetics\" was introduced by William Bateson in a personal letter to Adam Chadwick and he used it at the 3rd International Conference on Genetics in 1906. In relation to genetics, DNA has a very important role. DNA is the fundamental genetic material that controls the properties of living things, expressed in the form of polypeptides, although not entirely protein (can be expressed as RNA which has a catalytic reaction, such as SNRPs). Francis Crick explained the flow of information carried by DNA in a series of The Central Dogma, which reads that the flow of DNA information can be passed on to cells or other individuals by replication, can be expressed into an intermediate signal in the form of RNA, which can then be translated into polypeptides, units construct a phenotype of an existing organism. The field of genetic studies starts from the subcellular (molecular) region to populations. In more detail, genetics attempts to explain: Although people usually define genetics starting with the rediscovery of the manuscript of an article written by Gregor Mendel in 1900, in fact genetics as \"the science of inheritance\" or heredity has been known since prehistoric times, such as the domestication and development of various breeds of livestock and plant cultivars.

The popular theory of inheritance that was adopted at that time was the theory of mixed inheritance: a person inherits a flat mixture of traits brought by his parents, especially from males because they carry sperm. The results of Mendel's research showed that this theory was not valid because traits were carried in combinations carried by distinctive alleles, rather than a flat mixture. Another related opinion is Lamarck's theory: traits that parents acquire in life are passed on to their children. This theory also breaks with Mendel's explanation that traits carried by genes are not influenced by the experience of the individual who inherits that trait. Charles Darwin also provided an explanation with the pangenesis hypothesis and later modified by Francis Galton. In this opinion, the body's cells produce particles called gemmula which will be collected in the reproductive organs before fertilization occurs. So, every cell in the body has a contribution to the characteristics that will be brought by zuriat (heredity). In pre-Mendelian times, people did not know about genes and chromosomes (even though DNA had been extracted, but in the 19th century their function was not known). At that time, people still thought that traits were passed on through sperm (the female parent didn't contribute anything to the nature of her child). Laying the scientific basis through systematic experiments was only carried out in the latter half of the 19th century by Gregor Johann Mendel. He was a monk from Brno (Br\u00fcnn in German), the Austro-Hungarian Empire (now part of the Czech Republic). Mendel is generally accepted as the 'founder of genetics' after his work \"Versuche \u00fcber Pflanzenhybriden\" or Experiments on Plant Crosses (published in print in 1866) was rediscovered separately by Hugo de Vries, Carl Correns, and Erich von Tschermak in 1900.

From this measurement it can be interpreted how the properties and conditions below the earth's surface both vertically and horizontally. In different scales, geophysical methods can be applied globally, namely to determine the structure of the earth, locally, namely for mineral exploration and mining including petroleum and on a small scale, namely for geotechnical applications (determination of building foundations and others). Geophysics (in English: geophysics) consists of two words namely Geo which means earth and Physics which means physics. In principle, geophysics solves problems related to the earth using the principles of physics. In geology, research is carried out directly on rocks, conducting historical analysis, examining rock structure and composition with interpretation of measurements using supporting equipment. In Indonesia, this knowledge is studied in almost all state universities. Usually, geophysics is included in the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences (MIPA), because it requires a strong foundation of physics, or some include it in the Geology section. Currently, both geophysics and geology are almost an integral part of Earth science. Geophysics studies the earth with the principles of physics including heat, electromagnetic, mechanics and waves.

It is a rare, silvery-white, lustrous metal discovered in 1803 by William Hyde Wollaston. He named it after the asteroid Pallas, the nickname of the Greek goddess Athena, which he earned when he killed Pallas. Palladium, platinum, rhodium, ruthenium, iridium, and osmium form the group of elements referred to as the platinum group metals (platinum group metals, PGM). They share similar chemical properties, but palladium has the highest melting point and lowest density of the group. More than half of the supply of palladium and similar platinum goes into catalytic converters, which convert up to 90% of the noxious gases from motor vehicle exhaust (hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide) into less hazardous substances (nitrogen, carbon dioxide and water vapour). ). Palladium is also used in electronics, dentistry, medicine, hydrogen purification, chemical applications, groundwater recovery and jewelry. Palladium plays a key role in the technology used for fuel cells, which combine hydrogen and oxygen to produce electricity, heat and water. Deposits of palladium and other PGM ores are rare, and the most abundant deposits have been found in the norite belt of the Bushveld Igneous Complex which includes the Transvaal Basin in South Africa, the Stillwater Complex in Montana, United States, the Thunder Bay District in Ontario, Canada, and the Norilsk Complex in Russia. Palladium is in group 10 of the periodic table, but has a very aberrant configuration in its outer electron shell compared to other members of group 10 (see also niobium (41), ruthenium (44), and rhodium (45)), i.e. it has fewer electron shells filled than the previous elements (a unique phenomenon for palladium).",

Pd is soft and ductile when heated and greatly increases strength and hardness when cooled. Palladium dissolves slowly in concentrated nitric acid, in hot concentrated sulfuric acid, and in hydrochloric acid when ground. Common oxidation states of palladium are 0, +1, +2 and +4. There are relatively few known compounds with palladium in the +3 oxidation state, although they have been proposed as intermediates in many palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions. In 2002, palladium(VI) was first reported. Coated palladium with defects produced by bombardment of alpha particles at low temperatures exhibits superconductivity with Tc=3.2 K. Natural palladium consists of seven isotopes, six of which are stable. The most stable radioisotopes are 107Pd with a half-life of 6.5 million years (found in nature), 103Pd with a half-life of 17 days, and 100Pd with a half-life of 3.63 days. Eighteen other radioisotopes were identified with atomic masses ranging from 90.94948(64) u (91Pd) to 122.93426(64) u (123Pd).

Mutations at the gene level are called point mutations, while mutations at the chromosomal level are usually called aberrations. Mutations in genes can lead to the emergence of new alleles and form the basis for new variations within species. Mutations occur at a low frequency in nature, typically lower than 1:10,000 individuals. Mutations in nature can occur due to mutation-generating substances (mutagens, including carcinogens), solar radiation, radioactivity, ultraviolet rays, X-rays, and electrical energy jumps such as lightning. Individuals who show changes in character (phenotype) due to mutations are called mutants. In genetic studies, mutants are usually compared with individuals who do not experience any change in traits (wild-type individuals). Point mutations are changes to the N base of DNA or RNA. Point mutations are relatively common but their effects can be mitigated by gene recovery mechanisms. Point mutations can result in changes to the sequence of amino acids in proteins, and can result in reduction, change or loss of enzyme function. Current technology uses point mutations as markers (called SNPs) to study changes that occur in genes and are associated with phenotypic changes that occur. An example of a gene mutation is the reaction of nitric acid with adenine to form hypoxanthine. This substance will take the place of the original adenine and pair with cytosine, no longer with thymine. Chromosomal mutations, often also called major mutations or chromosomal aberrations, are changes in the number of chromosomes and the arrangement or sequence of genes in the chromosomes. Chromosomal mutations often occur due to errors in meiosis and few in mitosis. Euploidy is the change in the n number. In this case, \"n\" denotes the number of sets of chromosomes. For example, human body cells have 2 packages of chromosomes so they are called 2n, where one human n package has 23 chromosomes.",

Aneusomy is a change in the number of chromosomes. The cause is anaphase lag (the event of the spindle threads not attaching to the centromere) and non disjunction (failure to separate). Aneusomy in humans can cause: Occurs when a fragment of a chromosome is broken and lost during cell division. The chromosome from which the fragment originates will then be missing certain genes. However, in some cases, these broken fragments can bind to homologous chromosomes to produce duplications. The fragment can also be reattached to the original chromosome in the reverse direction and results in an inversion. Substances that cause mutations are called mutagens. Mutagens are divided into three, namely: In general, mutations are detrimental, the mutants are lethal and homozygous recessive. However, mutations are also beneficial, for example, through mutations, superior polyploid plants can be created. For example, seedless watermelons, seedless oranges, large strawberries, and so on. This mutation is also one of the keys to evolution in this world. The formation of polyploid plants is beneficial for humans, but detrimental for plants that have mutations, because these plants become unable to reproduce generatively. Although biologically most mutations cause disturbances in individual fitness, even death, mutations are actually one of the keys to the adaptability of a species (species) to a new or changing environment. This positive side is exploited by a number of fields of applied biology.

Aluminum hydroxide is then heated to a temperature slightly above 1000 oC to form alumina and H2O which becomes water vapor. After Alumina is produced, it is conveyed to the Hall-Heroult process. The Hall-Heroult process begins by dissolving alumina in molten Na3AlF6, or cryolite as it is commonly called. The solution is then electrolyzed and will cause molten aluminum to stick to the anode, while the oxygen from the alumina will be oxidized along with the anode which is made of carbon, forming carbon dioxide. Liquid aluminum has a lighter density than alumina solution, so separation can be done easily. The electrolysis of aluminum in the Hall-Heroult process consumes a significant amount of energy. The world's average consumption of electrical energy in electrolyzing alumina is 15 kWh per kilogram of aluminum produced. Electrical energy accounts for around 20-40% of the cost of producing aluminum worldwide.",

Located on the east bank of the River Rhine between Austria and Switzerland. All foreign affairs of this German-speaking country are taken care of by Switzerland. Liechtenstein is a constitutional monarchy headed by the Prince of Liechtenstein. Economically, Liechtenstein has one of the highest gross domestic products per person in the world when adjusted for purchasing power parity. The country has a strong financial sector centered in Vaduz. Liechtenstein was once known as a billionaire tax haven, but it no longer exists due to being on the official blacklist of uncooperative tax haven countries. As an Alpine country, Liechtenstein has mountains that make it a winter sports destination. In addition, Liechtenstein relies on its income from the tourism sector, especially the sale of stamps. Liechtenstein is a member of the United Nations, the European Free Trade Association and the Council of Europe. Although not a member of the European Union, it participates in the Schengen Area and the European Economic Area. The country has a customs union and a monetary union with Switzerland. Who is this noble family?] originates from Liechtenstein Castle in Lower Austria, which it belonged to at least from 1140 to the 13th century, and from 1807 onwards. Henry I. von Liechtenstein (d. 1265) was ruler of Nicolsburg, Liechtenstein and Petronell. Over the centuries, this dynasty acquired bits and pieces of territory, especially in Moravia, Lower Austria, Silesia and Styria, although in each case the they were fiefdoms under other, more senior feudal lords, notably the various descendants of the Habsburg house, of which several princes of Liechtenstein served as their close advisors.",

The heads of these noble families were later able to arrange purchases with the Hohenems of the small county of the Schellenberg Chair in 1699, and the County of Vaduz in 1712. Schellenberg and Vaduz did not have any other feudal lords apart from their own sovereign regents, and as vassals to the Emperor.

The literal meaning of meditation is the activity of chewing or flipping through the mind, thinking, contemplating. The meaning of the definition, meditation is structured mental activity, carried out over a certain period of time, to analyze, draw conclusions, and take further steps to address, determine actions or resolve personal, life, and behavioral problems. In other words, meditation releases us from the agony of highly subjective good and bad thoughts which are proportionally directly related to our attachments to certain thoughts and judgments. We begin to understand that life is an endless series of subjective thoughts, judgments, and releases that intuitively let's start letting go. In a state of mind that is free from thinking activity, it turns out that humans do not die, nor faint, and remain conscious. The best teacher for meditation is experience. There are no teachers, seminars, or meditation books that can teach exactly how we should live a meditative life. Meditation or meditation is often misinterpreted, considered the same as daydreaming so that meditation is considered a waste of time and is of no use. Meditation is actually a conscious act because the person doing the meditation knows and understands what he is doing. The benefits of meditation that we do can be directly or indirectly felt physically. One of these benefits is the healing we get, if we suffer from certain illnesses. From a physiological point of view, meditation is the best anti-stress. When you experience stress , heart rate and blood pressure increase, breathing becomes quick and short, and the adrenal glands pump out stress hormones. As you meditate, your heart rate slows down, your blood pressure normalizes, your breathing calms down, and your level of stress hormones decreases. During meditation, over time you can listen to your heart beat, and even more so you can coordinate the rhythm of your heart rate with the rhythm of going in and out. breath.",

Radon is formed from the decay of radium. Radon is also the heaviest and most dangerous gas for health. Rn-222 has a half-life of 3.8 days and is used in radiotherapy. Radon can trigger lung cancer and is responsible for 20,000 deaths in the European Union each year. Radon is chemically non-reactive, but radioactive. Radon is a gas with a high density of 9.73 g/L (the heaviest gas at standard temperature and pressure is tungsten hexafluoride, WF6, with a density of 13 g/L). At room temperature and pressure, radon is colorless but when cooled until it freezes, radon turns yellow, while liquid radon is red-orange. The natural buildup of radon gas in the earth's atmosphere occurs very slowly so that water that touches free air continues to lose radon due to the \"volatilization\" process. Groundwater has a higher radon content than surface water. Radon is sometimes used by some hospitals for therapeutic purposes. The radon is obtained by pumping from a radium source and stored in small tubes called ''seeds'' or ''needles''. Radon is rarely used anymore, but considering that hospitals can now get seeds from a \"supplier\" that produces seeds with the desired decay rate. Cobalt and cesium are usually used, which are durable for several years, making it more practical from a logistical point of view.

Since 1923 element 86 has been called Radon. On average, there is one molecule of radon in 1 x 1021 molecules of air. Radon can be found in some springs and hot springs. The city of Misasa, Japan, is famous for its radium-rich springs which produce radon. Radon is released from the soil naturally, especially in the land areas of Granite. It is also possible for radon to accumulate in basements and living quarters (however this also depends on how the house is maintained and how well ventilated it is) The European Union has determined that the safe limit for radon is 400 Bq/meter3 for old houses, and 200 Bq/m3 for new houses . The American ''Environmental Protection Agency'' recommends taking immediate action for all homes with a Radon concentration exceeding 148 Bq/m3 (measured as 4 pCi/L). Nearly one home every 15 in the U.S. has statistically high levels of radon (U.S. Surgeon General) and the EPA recommends that all homes be tested for radon.

However, the +1 state, which is much more prominent in thallium than in the elements above it, is reminiscent of the chemistry of the alkali metals, and thallium(I) ions are found geologically mostly in potassium-based ores, and (when ingested) are handled in much like potassium ions (K+) by ion pumps in living cells.

Due to its historical popularity as a murder weapon, thallium has gained fame as the \"poisoner's poison\" and \"heritage powder\" (along with arsenic). A thallium atom has 81 electrons, arranged in the electron configuration Xe]4f145d106s26p1; In this configuration, the three outermost electrons in the sixth shell are valence electrons. As a result of the oblique pair effect, the 6s electron pair is relativistically stabilized and it is more difficult to involve it in a chemical bond than it is for heavier elements. Thus, very few electrons are available for metallic bonding, similar to neighboring elements such as mercury and lead. Thallium, like its relative, is a soft, highly electrically conducting metal with a low melting point of 304\u00b0C. A number of standard electrode potentials, depending on the reactions studied, are reported for thallium, reflecting a large decrease in the stability of the +3 oxidation state: Thallium is the first element in group 13 in which the reduction of the +3 oxidation number to +1 occurs spontaneously under standard conditions. Since the bond energies decrease down the group, with thallium, the energy released in forming two additional bonds and reaching the +3 state is not always sufficient to exceed the energy required to engage the 6s electrons. Thus, thallium(I) oxide and hydroxide are more basic and thallium(III) oxide and hydroxide more acidic, indicating that thallium conforms to the general rule that an element is more electropositive at lower oxidation states.

It covers about 0.001 percent of the total weight of the Earth's crust. It is concentrated on Earth by the water solubility of its more common natural compound, the mineral borates. This mineral is mined industrially as an evaporite, such as borax and kernite. The largest known deposits are in Turkey, the largest producer of the mineral boron. Elemental boron is a metalloid found in trace amounts in meteoroids but chemically uncombined boron is not found naturally on Earth. Industrially, very pure elements are produced with difficulty due to contamination by carbon or other elements that resist removal. There are several allotropes of boron: amorphous boron is a brownish powder; crystals of boron are silvery to black, very hard (about 9.5 on the Mohs scale), and a poor conductor of electricity at room temperature. The main use of boron is as a boron filament with applications similar to carbon fiber in some high-strength materials. Boron is used primarily in chemical compounds. About half of all production consumed globally is an additive in glass fibers for insulation and structural materials.",

Borosilicate glass is preferred because of its greater strength and resistance to thermal shock than ordinary soda lime glass. As sodium perborate, it is used as a bleach. Small amounts of boron are used as dopants in semiconductors, and reagent intermediates in the synthesis of organic fine chemicals. Several organic boron-containing pharmaceuticals have been used or are being studied. Natural boron consists of two stable isotopes, one of which (boron-10) has a number of uses as a neutron capturing agent. Boron's intersection with biology is minuscule. Consensus on this as essential to mammalian life is lacking. Borates have low toxicity to mammals (similar to table salt) but are more toxic to arthropods and are sometimes used as insecticides. Boron-containing organic antibiotics are known. Although only trace amounts are required, it is an important plant nutrient. The word boron was coined from borax, the mineral from which it was isolated, by analogy with carbon, which is chemically similar to boron. Borax in its mineral form (later known as tincal) was first used as a glaze, starting in China around AD 300. Some raw borax traveled west, and is apparently mentioned by the alchemist Jabir bin Hayyan around AD 700. Marco Polo brought some glazes back to Italy in the 13th century. Around 1600 AD, Georgius Agricola, reported the use of borax as a flux in metallurgy. In 1777, boric acid was discovered in hot springs (soffioni) near Florence, Italy, which became known as sal sedativeum, with obvious medical benefits. The mineral is given the name sasolite, from Sasso Pisano in Italy.",

This property of the neutron made his discovery more retarded, and highly penetrating, making it difficult to observe directly and making it extremely important as an agent in nuclear change. The research conducted by Rutherford, apart from being successful in obtaining several satisfactory results, also found an oddity, namely that the mass of the atomic nucleus of an element is always greater than the mass of the protons in the atomic nucleus. Rutherford suspected that there were other particles in the atomic nucleus that were uncharged because atoms were positively charged due to the presence of positively charged protons. The existence of other particles in the atomic nucleus that is not charged was proved by James Chadwick in 1932. Chadwick conducted research by shooting beryllium metal using alpha rays. The results showed that an uncharged particle is released when beryllium metal is bombarded with alpha rays and these particles are called neutrons.",

In a deeper sense, Nibbana is the highest bliss, a state of extraordinary eternal bliss. [citation needed] The bliss of Nibbana cannot be experienced by indulging the senses, but by calming them. Nibbana is not a place. Nibbana is not an absence or extinction. Nibbana is not a heaven. There are no suitable words to describe this Nibbana.

Rubidium metal is similar to potassium metal and cesium metal in physical appearance, softness and conductivity. Rubidium cannot be stored under atmospheric oxygen, as a highly exothermic reaction would occur, sometimes even causing the metal to catch fire. Rubidium is the first alkali metal in its group to have a higher density than water, so it sinks, unlike the metals above it in its group. Rubidium has a standard atomic weight of 85.4678. On Earth, naturally occurring rubidium consists of two isotopes: 72% of which is the stable 85Rb, and the remaining 28% is the slightly radioactive 87Rb, with a half-life of 48.8 billion years\u2014more than three times the estimated age of the universe. German chemists Robert Bunsen and Gustav Kirchhoff discovered rubidium in 1861 by a newly developed technique, namely flame spectroscopy. The element's name comes from the Latin word rubidus, meaning dark red, from the color of its emission spectrum. Rubidium compounds have a wide range of chemical and electronic applications. Rubidium metal is volatile and has a convenient spectral absorption range, making it a frequent target for laser atomic manipulation. Rubidium is not a known nutrient for any living organism. However, rubidium ions have the same properties and the same charge as potassium ions, and are actively taken up and treated by animal cells in the same way.

As with potassium (which is slightly less reactive) and cesium (which is slightly more reactive), this reaction is usually strong enough to ignite the hydrogen gas it produces. Rubidium has also been reported to spontaneously ignite in air. It forms amalgams with mercury and alloys with gold, iron, cesium, sodium, and potassium, but not with lithium (although rubidium and lithium are in the same group). Rubidium has a very low ionization energy, only 406 kJ/mol. Rubidium and potassium show a very similar purple color in the flame test, and distinguishing the two elements requires more sophisticated analysis, such as spectroscopy. in others, it is used to induce living cells to take up DNA; it is also used as a biomarker, because in nature, it is only found in small amounts in living organisms and when present, replaces potassium. Another common rubidium compound is the corrosive rubidium hydroxide (RbOH), the starting material for most rubidium-based chemical processes; rubidium carbonate (Rb2CO3), used in some optical glasses, and rubidium copper sulfate, Rb2SO4\u00b7CuSO4\u00b76H2O. Rubidium silver iodide (RbAg4I5) has the highest room temperature conductivity of any known ionic crystal, a property that is exploited in thin film batteries and other applications. Rubidium will form a number of oxides when exposed to air, including rubidium monoxide (Rb2O), Rb6O, and Rb9O2; rubidium in excess oxygen will produce superoxide RbO2. Rubidium will form salts with the halogens, giving rubidium fluoride, rubidium chloride, rubidium bromide, and rubidium iodide.

        "paragraph": "Meiosis (from the Greek for \"reduction\") is a type of cell division that occurs in organisms that reproduce sexually to produce gamete cells such as sperm or egg cells. The main feature of meiosis is that it occurs in two stages of division. Ultimately, cells that undergo meiosis will produce four cells with each cell having only one copy of the parent chromosome (haploid). In addition, before the first division, the chromosomes of cells undergoing meiosis will share genetic material with each other in a process called crossing over which will result in a combination of genetic material in each of the cell's chromosomes. Later, when this haploid meiotic cell fuses with another haploid cell in a process called fertilization, the cell with two pairs of chromosomes (diploid) will form again as a zygote. This mechanism of meiosis allows organisms that reproduce sexually to maintain the number of chromosomes. In humans and animals, meiosis occurs in the gonads and produces gamete cells such as spermatocytes or egg cells. In plants, meiosis occurs in the antheridium and ovary and produces meiospores which will later differentiate into gamete cells as well. The first stage that occurs in the process of meiosis is DNA replication. This DNA replication will produce a new chromatid for each chromosome (now the term chromosome refers to the two sister chromatids). Next, the first meiotic division will produce haploid cells but still have sister chromatids so that another division is needed to release sister chromatids. This haploid cell is the end product of meiosis which has half the chromosomes of the parent. The first division is called meiosis I and the second division is called meiosis II. Before meiosis can begin, the cell must first undergo interphase.",

After DNA replication, the cell will enter the G2 phase. Furthermore, homologous chromosomes (chromosomes that encode the same properties, but one is of paternal origin, while the other is of maternal origin) will pair with each other to form a tetrad and share genetic material in a process called genetic recombination. This process is aided by a physical bridge formed between the two homologous chromosomes called chiasmata (from the Greek, chi (X)). In many organisms, this bonding will direct each pair of homologous chromosomes to separate from each other in the process of meiosis I, resulting in a haploid cell that has half the number of chromosomes but its sister chromatids are still attached. In meiosis II, the cohesion between these sister chromatids begins to break free and they begin to segregate from one another as in the process of mitosis. This process results in four types of cells that have haploid chromosomes and no longer have sister chromatids. In some organisms, these four cells will turn into gametes such as sperm, spores, or pollen. In female animals (including humans), three of these four cells will be eliminated to become polar bodies so that only one cell will develop into a gamete to form an egg (ovum). Because their chromosome number is halved during meiosis, these gametes can fuse (fertilize) to form a diploid zygote consisting of two copies of a chromosome, one from each parent. Thus, repeated cycles between meiosis and fertilization allow sexual reproduction to occur. Through this cycle, the next generation can maintain the same number of chromosomes as its parent.",

Knowledge includes, but is not limited to descriptions, hypotheses, concepts, theories, principles and procedures that are Bayesian Probability correct or useful. In another sense, knowledge is a variety of symptoms encountered and obtained by humans through the observation of reason. Knowledge arises when a person uses his mind to recognize certain objects or events that have never been seen or felt before. For example, when someone tastes a new dish that he is familiar with, he will gain knowledge about the shape, taste, and aroma of the dish. Knowledge is information that has been combined with understanding and the potential to act; which then sticks in someone's mind. In general, knowledge has the ability to predict something as a result of recognizing a pattern. Where information and data only have the ability to inform or even cause confusion, then knowledge has the ability to direct action. This is called the potential to act. Knowledge possessed by a person, of course, comes from various sources. Here are the sources of knowledge: In the view of the philosophers, reason is the source of knowledge. This view arises from the fact that knowledge is not formed by soul and matter. Therefore, knowledge must be sourced from a substance that is not material in terms of substance or actualization. The degree of this source of knowledge must be higher than that of the soul. This is based on the view that the soul in its actualization is still bound by matter. This substance is then referred to as reason. Especially in the subject matter of Knowledge Management, there are two main types of knowledge when viewed from their explicitity: Implicit knowledge is knowledge that is still embedded in the form of one's experience and contains factors that are not real such as personal beliefs, perspectives, and principles.",

A simple example of implicit knowledge is the ability to ride a bicycle. Common knowledge of how to ride a bicycle is that in order to balance, if the bicycle turns to the left, then point the steering wheel to the right. To turn right, first turn the steering wheel to the left a little, then when the bike is leaning to the right, turn the steering wheel to the right. But knowing that alone is not enough for a beginner to be able to steer a bicycle. A person who has implicit knowledge is usually unaware that he actually has it and also how that knowledge can benefit others. To get it, learning and skills are needed, but not necessarily in written forms. Implicit knowledge often contains customs and culture of which we are not even aware. Explicit knowledge is knowledge that has been documented or stored in a tangible form in the form of media or the like. It has been articulated in formal language and can be disseminated relatively easily. The most common forms of explicit knowledge are instructions for use, procedures, and how-to videos. Knowledge can also be mediated audio-visually. Art work and product design can also be seen as a form of explicit knowledge which is an externalization of human skills, motives and knowledge.

Consists of two parts, roughly equivalent to the first two chapters of the Book of Genesis. In the first part, Genesis 1:1-2:4, Elohim, which is the generic Hebrew word for \"God\", created the heavens and the earth in six days, beginning with the light that brightened the darkness on the first day, and ending with the creation of man on the sixth. . God then rested, blessed and sanctified the seventh day or Sabbath. In the second part, Genesis 2:4-2:25 God, referred to by His personal name, \"Yahweh\", created the first man (Adam) from the dust of the ground and breathed life into him. God then placed him in the Garden of Eden and created the first woman (Eve) from Adam's rib as his companion. There are those who view that the universe created in the record of Genesis 1:1\u20132:4 seems to bear a resemblance to the Tabernacle recorded in Exodus 35\u201340, and this was a prototype of the Temple in Jerusalem, as well as a center for Yahweh worship through the priests. Because of this, and because the creation story in other Middle Eastern regions also climaxes in the erection of a temple or shrine for a creator-god, Genesis 1 can be interpreted as the building of the universe as God's temple, where the Temple in Jerusalem is a reflection on earth.

It is one of a number of common feeding behavior types that includes parasitism and micropredation (which usually does not kill the host) and parasitoidism (which it always does eventually). This is different from scavenging on dead prey, although many predators also scavenge. This overlaps with herbivores because both seed predators and destructive frugivores are predators. Predators may actively seek, chase, or wait for prey, which is often hidden. When prey is tracked, the predator judges whether to attack it or not. This can sometimes be accompanied by an ambush or chase after stalking prey. If the attack is successful, the predator kills the prey, removes any inedible parts, such as shells or thorns, and eats it. Predators are adapted to keen senses, such as sight, hearing, or smell, which are often highly specialized for hunting. Many predators, both vertebrates and invertebrates, have sharp claws or jaws for gripping, killing, and tearing their prey. Other adaptations include aggressive and stealthy mimicry that increase hunting prowess. Predation has such a strong selective effect on prey that prey develops antipredator adaptations, such as warning colours, distress calls and other signals, camouflage, well-defended species mimicry, spines and defensive chemicals. Predators and prey sometimes enter into evolutionary arms races, adaptation cycles, and opposing adaptations. Predation has been a major driver of evolution since at least the Cambrian period. At the most basic level, predators kill and eat other organisms.

A predator can be defined differently from a parasitoid in that a predator has many prey items to catch during its life and a parasitoid larva has only one or at least has a food supply for it on only one occasion. There are other things that are difficult and limited. Micro predators are small predator-like animals that feed entirely on other organisms. These animals include fleas and mosquitoes which feed on the blood of living animals, and aphids which feed on the sap of living plants. However, these animals are now often regarded as parasites because they usually do not kill their hosts. Animals that graze on phytoplankton or microbial mats are predators because they eat and kill the organisms they feed on, but herbivores that graze on grass are not, because the plants they eat usually survive such attacks. When an animal eats seeds (seed predation or granivore) or eggs (egg predation), it eats the entire living organism, which makes it a predator by definition. Scavengers, organisms that feed only on organisms found dead, are not predators, but many predators such as jackals and hyenas which scavenge when the opportunity arises. Among invertebrates, the social (yellow-skinned) wasp is a hunter and scavenger of other insects. While examples of predators among mammals and birds are well known, they can be found in a variety of taxa including arthropods.

The contextualist view holds that controversial philosophical concepts, such as \"the meaning of P\", \"knowing that P\", \"having reasons for A\", and perhaps even \"being right\" or \"being right\" only have meanings relative to the given context. Some philosophers argue that context dependence can lead to relativism; However, the contextual view is gaining popularity in philosophy. In ethics, the \"contextual\" view is often associated with situational ethics, or with moral relativism. In architectural theory, contextualism is a theory of design in which modern building types (not to be confused with modernism) adapt ordinary city forms to traditional cities. The contextual principle is one of Gottlob Frege's three fundamental principles for philosophical analysis, first discussed in his Introduction to the Foundations of Arithmetic (Grundlagen der Arithmetik, 1884). Frege argues that there are many philosophical errors, especially those related to psychology in the philosophy of logic and philosophy of mathematics, so that these mistakes can be avoided by adhering to the principle of context. The meaning of the view expressed by the principle of context is sometimes called contextualism, but it should not be confused with the contemporary use of the term contextualism according to its epistemology or ethics. This view need not be contrasted with the view that the meaning of a word or expression can (or must) be determined in advance, and regardless, the meaning of the proposition in which it occurs, is often referred to as composition.

While the word 'I' has a linguistic meaning that is constant in all contexts of use, which refers to various contexts. Likewise, contextual epistemic argues that the word 'know' is context sensitive, expressing different relationships in different contexts. Contextualism was introduced, in part, to undermine the skeptical argument that has this basic structure: The contextualist's solution is not to reject any premise, or say that the argument does not follow, but to relate the truth value (3) to the context, and say that we can reject (3) in everyday conversational contexts like contexts - where we have different requirements to say we know. The main principle of contextual epistemology, no matter what kind of knowledge it adheres to, what is important is that knowledge links are sensitive to context. Then the truth value of the term \"know\" depends on the context in which it is used. We can realize that in a context where the standard for claiming correct knowledge is very high-e. e., in a skeptical context - if we say something like 'I know that I have hands' then this statement will be false. Nonetheless, if we utter the same proposition in an ordinary context - for example, in a cafe with friends -, where a lower standard is available, the statement will be true, even more so, the negation will be false.

Both definitions are properties that light exhibits simultaneously so it is called \"wave-particle dualism\". Packages of light called the spectrum are then perceived visually by the sense of sight as colors. The field of study of light, known as optics, is an important research area in modern physics. The study of light began with the emergence of the era of classical optics which studied optical quantities such as: intensity, frequency or wavelength, polarization and phase of light. The properties of light and its interaction with the surroundings are carried out using a geometric paraxial approach such as reflection and refraction, and an approach to its physical optical properties, namely: interference, diffraction, dispersion, polarization. Each study of classical optics is called geometrical optics (en:geometrical optics) and physical optics (en:physical optics).

In 1905, Albert Einstein made an experiment on the photoelectric effect, light which shines light on the atom excites electrons to shoot out of their orbits. In 1924 experiments by Louis de Broglie showed that electrons have particle-wave duality properties, so that the theory of particle-wave duality was born.",

The work of Albert Einstein and Max Planck won the Nobel Prizes in 1921 and 1918 respectively and became the basis for the theory of quantum mechanics developed by many scientists, including Werner Heisenberg, Niels Bohr, Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, Max Born, John von Neumann, Paul Dirac, Wolfgang Pauli, David Hilbert, Roy J. Glauber and others. This era was later called the era of modern optics and light was defined as the dualism of electromagnetic transverse waves and streams of particles called photons. Further development occurred in 1953 with the discovery of the maser beam, and laser light in 1960. The era of modern optics did not necessarily end the era of classical optics, but introduced other properties of light, namely diffusion and scattering. The Ancient Greeks believed that everything was composed of the four elements of fire, air, earth and water. In the fifth century BC, Empedocles stated that the goddess Aphrodite created the human eye from these four elements. He also kindled a fire in the eyes so that rays came out of the eyes and allowed humans to see. Empedocles added that there is an interaction between light from the eye and light from sources such as the sun so that humans cannot see at night. Around 300 BC, Euclid wrote his Optica which discussed the properties of light. Euclid stated that light travels in straight lines and he studied the laws of reflection mathematically. He questioned the notion that vision is the result of light emanating from the eye. If a person closes his eyes at night and opens them, he will immediately see a distant star.",

A person who practices psychology is referred to as a psychologist. Psychologists try to improve a person's quality of life through certain interventions on mental function, individual and group behavior, which are based on physiological, neurological and psychosocial processes. The word Psychology comes from the Ancient Greek: psyche (meaning breath, soul or mind) and logos (meaning words, discourse and knowledge), so that literally, psychology means the study of mind. The term \"psychology\" is a mistake that often arises because the word \"psychology\" itself means \"science of the soul\". The history of the development of psychology is generally divided into 3 periods, namely pre-systematic psychology, systematic psychology and scientific psychology. Pre-systematic psychology begins when humans begin to contemplate their existence. These reflections are irregular in nature and are generally associated with mythological and religious thought. Systematic psychology began to develop in 400 BC through Plato's thoughts. Psychology began to be given contemplations that are rationally ordered. Meanwhile, scientific psychology began to develop at the end of the 19th century AD. Psychology is a separate science that has various factual conclusions with clear definitions. As part of science, psychology has gone through a long journey. The concept of psychology can be traced back to the ancient Greeks. Psychology has roots in the field of philosophy which was initiated since the time of Aristotle as the science of the soul, namely the science of life force (levens beginsel). Aristotle saw psychology as a science that studies the phenomena of life. The soul is the element of life (Anima), therefore every living thing has a soul.",

In humans, mothers with wombs carrying twins will thus experience multiple deliveries and usually a shorter gestation period (34 to 36 weeks) than singleton pregnancies. Because premature birth usually has health consequences for the baby, multiple births are often treated in a different way than regular births. Twins are common in animals because many animals produce mature (ready to be fertilized) eggs at the same time. Domestic animals such as cats, dogs, rats or sheep usually have more than one child. Judging from the origin of the zygote, there are two types of twin births: fraternal (dizygotic) and identical (monozygotic). Dizygotic twins are common in vertebrates, while monozygotic twins are rare. Humans have this ability. The nine-banded armadillo (Dacypus novemcinctus) when giving birth always has monozygotic quadruplets. Dizygotic twins (known as \"non-identical twins\") occur because the zygotes that form come from different eggs. There is more than one egg attached to the uterine wall that is fertilized by sperm cells at the same time. In humans, the process of ovulation sometimes releases more than one mature egg into the fallopian tube which, if fertilized, gives rise to more than one zygote. Dizygotic twins are genetically no different from siblings and develop in separate amnions and placentas. They can have different or the same sex, but with the consequence of having a different physical appearance such as face, posture, skin color, or hair. Studies also show that the talent for giving birth to DZ twins is passed on to their offspring (genetic), but only female offspring/ females who are able to show it (because only females/females can regulate the release of eggs).",

Monozygotic twins occur when a single egg is fertilized and forms a zygote (monozygotic). During its development, the zygote divides into different embryos. The two embryos develop into fetuses that share the same uterus. Depending on the stage of separation of the zygote, identical twins may share the same amnion (known as monoamniotic) or different amnions. Furthermore, identical non-monoamniotic twins may or may not share the same placenta (known as monochorionic, monochorionic). All monoamniotic twins are definitely monochorionic. Sharing the same amnion (or the same amnion and placenta) can cause complications in pregnancy. For example, the umbilical cord of monoamniotic twins can become entangled, reducing or interfering with blood supply to the developing fetus. MZ twins are always of the same sex and are genetically the same (clones) except when there is a mutation in the development of one individual. The degree of resemblance to these twins is very high, with the difference sometimes occurring in the form of a mirror resemblance. Differences occur in details, such as fingerprints. As individuals grow older, the level of similarity usually decreases due to different personal experiences or lifestyles. Research from Fraga et al. (2005) revealed that there is an epigenetic influence in the process that distinguishes individuals who are MZ twins, due to different activated genes. Although there is the influence of habit or experience that influences these differences, scientists think random processes play more of a role in the differences that occur. Studies with mice have even shown differences in activity in histones (related to epigenetics) of the first four cells formed.

Epigenetics comes from the Greek, epi- which means \"over\" or \"covers\", and -genetics. There is no change in the basic DNA sequence, but rather non-genetic factors that cause the organism's gene expression to change. The best example of epigenetic change in eukaryotes is the process of cell differentiation. During morphogenesis, totipotent stem cells transform into various pluripotent cells of the embryo which then transform into fully differentiated cells. In other words, a zygote, a fertilized egg, turns into various types of cells, such as neurons (nerve cells), muscle cells, epithelium, blood vessels, and so on, which will then continue to divide. This is the case where the activation of some genes results in the muting of others. Another example is as shown in the figure, two cloned mice with the same gene and different DNA methylation status produce different genetic expressions. The history of epigenetics is related to the study of evolution and development, but then the term epigenetics has undergone changes along with the rapid increase in understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes. Until the 1950s, the term epigenetics was used differently, namely to group all developmental events starting from the zygote to the adult organism, in this case all the regulatory processes, starting from the genetic material which then forms the final product (Waddington, 1953). Organisms used in epigenetic research include Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Neurospora crassa, which are single-cell and low-level eukaryotic organisms with short life cycles, Arabidopsis thaliana in which there is suppression of gene transcription by complex RNAi, Tetrahymena and Paramecium which having a unique dimorphic cell nucleus, Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster, invertebrates which are multicellular organisms, to vertebrate organisms (mammals).",

Intentional abortions are often called \"induced abortions\" or \"provocated abortions\". The word abortion is generally only used in the sense of abortion provocatus. A similar procedure performed after the fetus has the potential to survive outside the uterus is also known as a \"late-stage abortion\". It is said that abortion in developed countries, where it is permitted, is one of the safest medical procedures in medicine. Modern methods use drugs or surgery in carrying out abortions. The drug mifepristone in combination with prostaglandins is probably as safe and effective as surgery during the first and second trimesters of pregnancy. Birth control, such as pills or an intrauterine device, may be used immediately after the abortion. It is reported that provocatus abortion, if carried out safely and legally, does not increase the risk of physical or mental problems in the long term. In contrast, unsafe abortions result in 47,000 deaths and 5 million hospitalizations each year. The World Health Organization recommends making safe and legal abortion available to all women.

Thorium is a bright silvery, paramagnetic, radioactive metal actinide. In the periodic table, thorium is to the right of actinium, to the left of protactinium, and below cerium. Pure thorium is very malleable, and like most metals, can be cold rolled, tempered, and shaped. At room temperature, thorium metal has a face-centered cubic crystal structure. It also has two other forms, one at high temperature (over 1360\u00b0C), which is body-centered cubic and another at high pressure (about 100 GPa), which is body-centered tetragonal. Thorium metal has a compression modulus (a measure of the resistance to compression of a material) of 54 GPa, about the same as tin (58.2 GPa). For comparison, the compression modulus of aluminum is 75.2 GPa; copper 137.8 GPa; and mild steel of 160-169 GPa. Thorium is as hard as mild steel, so when heated it can be rolled into sheets and drawn into wire. The density of thorium is nearly half that of uranium and plutonium. But it is harder than the two metals. Thorium becomes superconductive below 1.4 K. Thorium's melting point of 1,750\u00b0C is above that of actinium (1,227\u00b0C) and protactinium (1568\u00b0C).

Ferromagnetism can persist as long as the temperature of the material does not exceed the Curie temperature. Dear Felicia Molecules Ferromagnetism can occur in materials with atoms having magnetic moments of the atoms in random directions with each other. The magnetic moments become regular and align in the presence of an external magnetic field. After the external magnetic field is removed, the magnetic moments on the atoms of the material will cancel each other to form a magnetic moment with a small amount. Ferromagnetism has two similar magnetic poles related to the spins of the unpaired electrons. These magnetic poles have a uniform direction with the surrounding magnetic poles in groups of very small sizes. This group is called a domain. The domains in ferromagnetism have random directions with each other. Permanent magnets are formed by abbreviation of existing domains. The degree of ferromagnetism is determined by the regularity of the electron spins. Strong magnetism results from spins with long regularity, whereas magnetism disappears when the spins are completely random. Ferromagnetism can reach a magnetization stage with a value of zero at the Curie temperature. This stage appears after the ferromagnetism has gone through its maximum magnetization.

        "paragraph": "Astatine is a chemical element with the symbol At and atomic number 85. It is the rarest naturally occurring element in the Earth's crust, occurring only as the decay product of various heavier elements. All astatine isotopes are short-lived; the most stable is astatine-210, with a half-life of 8.1 hours. A sample of pure astatine is never made, because any macroscopic specimen of it is immediately vaporized by its own radioactive heat. The properties of most astatines are not known with certainty. Many of these properties are derived from the prediction of astatine's position on the periodic table as a heavier analogue of iodine, and a member of the halogens (the group of elements that contains fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine). However, astatine also lies along the dividing line between metals and nonmetals, so some metal behavior has also been observed and predicted for it. Astatine tends to have a dark or shiny appearance and may be a semiconductor or may be a metal. Chemically, several anionic astatine species are known and most of their compounds are similar to iodine, but sometimes also exhibit metallic characteristics and show some similarities to silver. The first synthesis of the element was carried out in 1940 by Dale R. Corson, Kenneth R. MacKenzie, and Emilio G. Segr\u00e8 at the University of California, Berkeley, who named it from the Ancient Greek \u1f04\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 (astatos) 'unstable'. Four isotopes of astatine were later found to occur naturally, although far less than one gram is present at any given time in the Earth's crust. Neither the most stable isotope astatine-210, nor the medically useful astatine-211, occur naturally; they can only be produced synthetically, usually by bombarding bismuth-209 with alpha particles. Astatine is a highly radioactive element; all of which have half-lives of 8.1 hours or less, decaying into the other isotopes of astatine, bismuth, polonium, or radon.",

Of the first 101 elements in the periodic table, only francium is the less stable, and all isotopes of astatine which are more stable than francium, however, are synthetic and do not occur in nature. The properties of most astatines are not known with certainty. Research is limited by its short half-life, which prevents the creation of a quantifiable quantity. A visible piece of astatine will soon vaporize itself due to the heat generated by its intense radioactivity. It remains to be seen whether, with sufficient cooling, macroscopic amounts of astatine can be deposited as thin films. Astatine is usually classified as a nonmetal or metalloid; metal formation has also been predicted. Most of the physical properties of astatine have been estimated (by interpolation or extrapolation), using theoretically or empirically derived methods. For example, halogens get darker with increasing atomic weight \u2013 fluorine is almost colorless, chlorine is yellow green, bromine is red brown, and iodine is dark gray/purple. Astatine is sometimes described as possibly being a black solid (assuming following this trend), or having a metallic appearance (if it is a metalloid or metal). Astatine sublimes more easily than iodine, because it has a lower vapor pressure. However, half of a given amount of astatine will evaporate in about one hour if placed on a clean glass surface at room temperature. a] The absorption spectrum of astatine in the mid-ultraviolet region has lines at 224.401 and 216.225 nm, indicating a 6p to 7s transition . The structure of solid astatine is still unknown. As an iodine analogue, it may have an orthorhombic crystal structure consisting of diatomic astatine molecules, and be a semiconductor (with a band gap of 0.7 eV).",

The study of glaciology also includes aspects of other sciences such as geophysics, geology, physical geography, geomorphology, climatology, meteorology, hydrology, biology and ecology. Glaciers are one of the natural phenomena that are extensively reviewed by glaciologists. Structural glaciology is a branch of glaciology that specifically deals with the structure of glaciers. The scope of the discussion is an understanding of the process of distribution and movement of ice debris in the glacier. The formation of the glacial structure is related to the transport of ice debris as a result of internal deformation. The study of glaciology, especially the study of ice masses, is a complex study because it requires an understanding of various processes of dynamics, thermodynamics and long-term behavior of ice sheets. On the other hand, this study was difficult to carry out because the environmental conditions were very cold and dark for a very long time. Remote sensing has provided useful results in glaciological studies, especially in the study of ice masses. Since the 1950s, radar systems have been developed as a remote sensing method for measuring ice thickness. One of the radar systems that is widely used in remote sensing in glaciology is radio echo sounding. The working principle utilizes electromagnetic waves that can penetrate the ice layer. Radio echo sounding is used to obtain information about the electromagnetic properties of different interfaces. These interfaces include ice cubes, ice water, and ice on sea water. The resulting sound echoes back into the radar. The large use of energy characterizes radio echo sounding.",

Prior to the 1980s, glaciology was not considered important in international policy studies on climate change. The initial study that started to tie the knot was a project called the Vostok Ice Core which had been under way since the 1970s. The study was conducted at a Soviet Union station located at a remote point in the arctic part of East Antarctica. The Soviet Union and France then collaborated on this study in the mid-1980s. Then in 1987, the two countries published the results of their collaboration regarding the relationship between stable water isotopes and greenhouse gas concentrations. These greenhouse gases include methane and carbon dioxide. The identification process is carried out in air bubbles in the ice core. The isotope ratios in the ice make it clear that there is a clear relationship between the concentration of greenhouse gases and the temperature of the air above the ice sheet. At a depth of 2 kilometers in the ice core, the signal conditions of the glacial-interglacial cycle for about 110 thousand years were recorded. The results of deep-sea sediment records have provided information that temperature signals do not only respond to changes in the geometry of the Earth's orbit. The temperature signal is also getting stronger due to the presence of greenhouse gases. This is why the United Nations launched the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 1988. This scientific panel then produces regular reports that provide summaries of the current state of knowledge about the climate system.

Several decades ago Liberia was hit by two civil wars (1989\u20131996 and 1999\u20132003) which resulted in hundreds of thousands of residents fleeing while destroying the economy. Along with Ethiopia, Liberia is one of only two modern countries in Sub-Saharan Africa that did not experience European colonization. Beginning in 1820, the area was colonized by black people from the United States, most of whom were freed slaves. These immigrants founded a new nation with help from the American Colonization Society, a private organization that believed that former slaves would have greater freedom and equality in Africa. Black people in America were given the choice of staying in America and being restricted in their rights or moving to their continent of origin. In 1847, a country was founded called the Republic of Liberia, and established a government modeled on that of the United States with the capital city of Monrovia, a city named in honor of James Monroe, the fifth president of the United States and a prominent supporter of colonization. The colonists, known as Americo-Liberians, led the country's political and economic sectors. Liberia's constitution and flag are modeled after the United States. The country began to modernize in the 1940s following investment from the United States during World War II and economic liberalization under President William Tubman. Liberia is a founding member of the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity. Before the Americo-Liberians arrived, this area was already inhabited by various tribes, so there was tension between the newcomers and the native tribes.

There are 1.4 trillion cubic kilometers (330 million mi\u00b3) of water available on Earth. Most of the water can be found in the sea (salt water) and in the ice caps (at the poles and on the tops of mountains). Apart from that, water can also be found in clouds, rain, rivers, surface fresh water, lakes, water vapor, and sea ice. The water in these objects moves according to a water cycle, namely: through evaporation, rain, and the flow of water over the ground surface (runoff, including springs, rivers, estuaries) towards the sea. Clean water is important for human life. In addition to Earth, large amounts of water are also thought to exist at the north and south poles of Mars, as well as on the moons Europa and Enceladus.

Water is colorless, tasteless and odorless under standard conditions, namely at a pressure of 100 kPa (1 bar) and a temperature of 273.15 K (0\u00b0C). This chemical is an important solvent, having the ability to dissolve many other chemicals, such as salts, sugars, acids, several types of gases and many types of organic molecules. The liquid state of water is an unusual condition under normal conditions, especially considering the relationship between other similar hydrides in the oxygen column of the periodic table, which suggests that water should be in a gaseous state, as is hydrogen sulfide. By looking at the periodic table, it can be seen that the elements surrounding oxygen are nitrogen, fluorine and phosphorus, sulfur and chlorine. All of these elements when bonded to hydrogen will produce gas at normal temperature and pressure. The reason why hydrogen bonds with oxygen to form a liquid state is because oxygen is more electronegative than these other elements (except fluorine). The oxygen atom's pull on the bonding electrons is much stronger than that of the hydrogen atom, leaving a sum of the positive charges on the two hydrogen atoms, and a sum of the negative charges on the oxygen atom. The presence of a charge on each of these atoms makes the water molecule have a number of dipole moments. The electric attraction between water molecules due to the presence of this dipole pulls the individual molecules closer together, making it difficult to separate them and which in turn raises the boiling point of water. This force of attraction is known as a hydrogen bond. Water is often referred to as the universal solvent because it dissolves many chemicals.",

A democratic government is different from a form of government in which the power is held by one person, such as a monarchy. Derived from the Greek philosophy today seems ambiguous because some contemporary governments mix elements of democracy, oligarchy, and monarchy. Karl Popper defined democracy as distinct from dictatorship or tyranny, thus focusing on the opportunity for a society to control its dishonest or untrustworthy leaders and remove them without needing a revolution. There are several types of democracy, but only two basic forms. Both explain how all people carry out their wishes. The first form of democracy is direct democracy, in which all citizens play a direct and active role in making government decisions. In most modern democracies, the entire people is still a sovereign power but political power is exercised indirectly through representatives; so-called indirect democracy.

In electronic equipment, a voltmeter is used to monitor the value of the working voltage. The voltmeter is composed of several parts, namely the positive and negative terminals, measuring limits, function control setups, pointer and high and low scales. In electrical circuits, a voltmeter is a device for measuring electric voltage. The movement of the pointer on the voltmeter occurs because of the magnetic force that arises as a result of the interaction between the magnetic field and the electric current. The deviation generated by the movement of the needle is proportional to the strength of the flowing electric current. The electric current that is measured is the electric current through the coil placed between the magnetic fields. An increase in current means an increase in the deviation of the movement of the needle so that it will point to a larger voltage measurement value. The voltmeter is connected in parallel with the component to be measured in the electrical circuit. The constituent parts consist of three copper plates. The location of the copper is in a bakelite on an inner plate that is arranged in a glass or plastic tube. The size of the glass tube is generally about 15 cm in diameter and 10 cm. The outer plate serves as the anode and the plate in the middle functions as the cathode. The voltmeter is made by having a galvanometer and resistance connected in series as a multiplier. Series resistance increases the range of a voltmeter several times. A voltmeter is a measuring instrument that functions to measure the amount of electric voltage that exists in an electric circuit in a certain quantity and unit. Measuring limits in voltmeters are expressed in millivolts (mV), voltmeters (V), microvolts, or kilovolts (kV). The measuring limit is the maximum value of the voltage that can be measured by a voltmeter.",

        "paragraph": "Measurement of electric voltage that exceeds the maximum value of the voltmeter measuring limit will result in damage to the voltmeter component. The measuring limit of the voltmeter can be enlarged several times by using a multiplier factor. Voltmeters that use the rotating coil principle have coils connected in series with a high resistance. In direct current voltmeters, the resistance multiplier is placed in series with the permanent magnet rotating coil which functions as the multiplier factor. The resistance multiplier converts the movement of the coil into a direct current voltmeter. In the resistance multiplier, the current is limited to the meter so as not to exceed the full scale current. Voltage measurements in direct current are only made at the potential difference between two points in a direct current circuit. Voltmeters are connected in parallel to a voltage source or circuit component. The polarity determination makes the terminals on the voltmeter marked positive and negative. Enlargement of the measuring limit is done by determining the value of the resistance multiplier through the factor of maximum range voltage (V), deflection current (Im), internal resistance (Rm), and multiplier resistance. (Rs), with the formula: V= Im (Rs+Rm). On a voltmeter with a measuring limit of up to 500 Volts, the multiplier resistance is installed on the inside of the voltmeter. At higher voltages, a resistance multiplier is attached to a pair of polar probes on the outside of the voltmeter. The purpose of external mounting is to prevent overheating inside the voltmeter. The addition of a number of multipliers along with a selector switch, makes the voltmeter usable at a number of voltage values. A digital voltmeter is a voltmeter that shows the results of measuring the electric voltage digitally. The working principle is to convert analog input voltage to digital. Digital voltmeters use an analog-to-digital converter. Digital representation is done using BCD-codes. The use of an analog-to-digital converter is only carried out if the voltage to be measured is of small value.",

Kalimantan is the third largest island in the world, located north of Java Island and west of Sulawesi Island. The island of Borneo is divided into the territories of Indonesia (73%), Malaysia (26%) and Brunei (1%). The island of Borneo is known as the \"Island of a Thousand Rivers\" because of the many rivers that flow on this island. Borneo\u2014which comes from the name of the sultanate of Brunei\u2014is the name used by British and Dutch colonials to refer to this island as a whole, while Kalimantan is the name used by residents of the eastern part of the island which is now part of Indonesia. The northern region of this island (Sabah, Brunei , Sarawak) for Malaysia and Brunei Darussalam. Meanwhile for the northern region of Indonesia, is the province of North Kalimantan. In a broad sense, \"Kalimantan\" includes the entire island which is also called Borneo, while in a narrow sense, Kalimantan only refers to the territory of Indonesia. The origin of the name Kalimantan is not very clear. The term kelamantan is used in Sarawak to refer to groups of people who consume sago in the northern region of the island. According to Crowfurd, the word Kalimantan is the name of a type of mango (Mangifera) so that the island of Kalimantan is an island of mangoes. But he added that the word was fairytale and unpopular. Until now, there are many local mangoes called klemantan in rural areas in Ketapang and its surroundings, West Kalimantan. According to C. Hose and Mac Dougall, \"Kalimantan\" comes from the names of six groups of local tribes namely Iban (Dayak Laut), Kayan, Kenyah, Klemantan (Dayak Darat), Murut, and Punan. In his essay, Natural Man, a Record from Borneo (1926), Hose explained that Klemantan was a new name used by the Malay people.",

Another opinion states that Kalimantan or Klemantan comes from Sanskrit, Kalamanthana is an island where the air is very hot or burning (kala]: season, time and manthana]: burning). Because the vowels a in kala and manthana are not pronounced according to custom, then Kalamanthana is pronounced Kalmantan which is then called the native of Klemantan or Quallamontan which is finally revealed to be Kalimantan. There are three major (main) kingdoms on this island, namely Borneo (Brunei/Barune), Succadana (Tanjungpura/Bakulapura), and Banjarmasinn (Nusa Kencana). Residents of the eastern region of the island call it K'lemantan Island, Italians know it Calemantan and Ukrainians: \u041a\u0430\u043b\u0456\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0430\u043d. If judging from the Javanese language, the name Kalimantan can mean \"River of Diamonds\". Throughout its history, Kalimantan has also been known by other names. The Singasari Kingdom, for example, called it \"Bakulapura\" which is its colony in southwest Kalimantan. Bakula in Sanskrit means cape tree (Mimusops elengi) so that Bakulapura got the Malay name \"Tanjungpura\" which means land/island of cape trees, namely the royal name of Tanjungpura which is often used as the name of the island. Meanwhile the Majapahit Kingdom in the Kakawin Nagarakretagama written in 1365 called it \"Tanjungnagara\" which also included the Philippines such as Saludung (Manila) and the Sulu Archipelago. Hikayat Banjar, an ancient chronicle from South Kalimantan whose final chapter was written in 1663, but the Hikayat Banjar manuscript itself originates from a manuscript with an older Malay language text during the Hindu kingdom, in which it calls Borneo Island with the Malay name, namely the island \"Hujung Soil\". The term Hujung Tanah appears based on the geomorphological shape of the South Kalimantan region in ancient times in the form of a peninsula formed from a row of Meratus Mountains with land ending in the South Cape which juts into the Java Sea.",

        "paragraph": "Idealism is a term used for the first time in philosophy by Leibniz in the early 18th century. He applied this term to Plato's thought, while contrasting it with Epicurus' materialism. The term Idealism is a philosophical school that views the mental and ideational as the key to the nature of reality. From the 17th century to the beginning of the 20th century this term was widely used in clarifying philosophy. Idealism provides the doctrine that the nature of the physical world can only be understood in its dependence on the soul (mind) and spirit (spirit). This term is taken from \"idea\", which is something that is present in the soul. In modern philosophy, this view was first seen in George Berkeley (1685-1753) who stated that the nature of physical objects are ideas. Leibniz used this term at the beginning of the 18th century, characterizing Plato's thought as opposed to Epicurus' materialism (Reese: 243). Idealism has its own epistemological argument. Therefore, the theist figures who teach that matter depends on the spirit are not called idealists because they do not use the epistemological arguments used by idealism. They use the argument that physical objects are ultimately God's creations; the idealists argue that physical objects cannot be understood apart from spirit. Idealism comes from the word idea which means the world in the soul (Plato), so this view emphasizes things that are ideas, and degrades things that are material and physical. Reality itself is explained by psychic symptoms, spirit, mind, self, absolute mind, not with regard to matter. There are quite a number of other characters; Berkeley, Jonathan Edwards, Howison, Edmund Husserl, Messer and others. In the world of literature, there is also a stream of idealism, for example a story, in which there is a message that the author wants to convey.",

        "paragraph": "Dehydrogenation is a chemical reaction that involves the removal of hydrogen from organic molecules. This is the opposite of hydrogenation. Dehydrogenation is an important reaction because it converts alkanes, which are relatively inert and of low value, to olefins, which are reactive and more valuable. Alkenes are precursors for aldehydes, alcohols, polymers and aromatics. The dehydrogenation process is used extensively to produce aromatics and styrene in the petrochemical industry. Such a process is highly endothermic requiring a minimum temperature of 500\u00b0C. Dehydrogenation also converts saturated fats into unsaturated fats. The enzymes that catalyze dehydrogenation are called dehydrogenases. Various dehydrogenation processes have been described, especially for organic compounds: One of the largest-scale dehydrogenation reactions is the production of styrene via the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene. Typical dehydrogenation catalysts are iron(III) oxide based, using a few percent potassium oxide or potassium carbonate. Formaldehyde is produced industrially by the catalytic oxidation of methanol, which can also be considered as dehydrogenation using O2 as an acceptor. The most common catalysts are metallic silver or a mixture of iron oxide and molybdenum or vanadium. In the commonly used formox process, methanol and oxygen react at approx. 250\u2013400 \u00b0C in the presence of iron oxide in combination with molybdenum and/or vanadium to produce formaldehyde according to the chemical equation: The importance of the catalytic dehydrogenation of paraffinic hydrocarbons to olefins has been growing with steady in the last few years. Light olefins, such as butene, are important raw materials for the synthesis of polymers, gasoline additives and various other petrochemical products. Cracking processes, especially liquid catalytic cracking and steam cracking, produce high-purity mono-olefins, such as 1-butene or butadiene. Nonetheless, further research is focused on developing alternatives such as oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) for two reasons: (1) unwanted reactions that occur at high temperatures leading to catalyst deactivation, which makes frequent catalyst regeneration unavoidable, and (2 ) consumes a large amount of heat and requires a high reaction temperature.",

It was first isolated from potash\u00a0en], plant ash, from which its English name is derived. In the periodic table, potassium is one of the alkali metals. All the alkali metals have one valence electron in their outer electron shell, which is easily released to form a positively charged ion \u2013 a cation, which combines with an anion to form a salt. Potassium is found in nature only in ionic salts. Elemental potassium is a soft, silvery-white alkali metal that oxidizes rapidly in air and reacts violently with water, producing enough heat to ignite the hydrogen emitted in the reaction and burning with a purple flame. It is found dissolved in seawater (i.e. 0.04% potassium by weight), and is a part of many minerals. Potassium is chemically very similar to sodium, the previous element in group 1 of the periodic table. They have the same first ionization energy, which allows each atom to lose its only outer electron. That they were different elements combining with the same anions to make similar salts was suspected in 1702, and proved in 1807 using electrolysis. Naturally occurring potassium consists of three isotopes, of which 40K is radioactive. Trace 40K is found in all potassium, and it is the most common radioisotope in the human body. Potassium ions are necessary for the function of all living cells. Transfer of potassium ions across the nerve cell membrane is necessary for normal nerve transmission; Potassium deficiency and excess can respectively result in many abnormalities, including abnormal heart rhythms and various electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities.",

Heavy crop production quickly depletes soil potassium, and this can be countered by potassium-containing fertilizers, which account for 95% of global potassium production. English name: potassium for the element potassium comes from the word \"potash\", which refers to an early method of extracting various potassium salts: burning wood ashes or tree leaves were put in a pot, water was added, heated, and the solution was evaporated. When Humphry Davy first isolated the pure element using electrolysis in 1807, he named it potassium (English: potassium) after the word potash.

In the field of philosophy, epistemology includes discussions about the origin, sources, scope, value validity, and truth of knowledge. Epistemology studies the nature of knowledge, justification, and the rationality of beliefs. Epistemology has become widely discussed in various fields, epistemology is centered into four areas, namely 1) Philosophical analysis related to the nature of knowledge and how this is related to conceptions such as truth, belief, and justification, 2) Various problems of skepticism, 3) Sources and scope of knowledge and justification for belief, and 4) Criteria for knowledge and justification. Epistemology addresses questions such as, \"What makes justifiable truths justifiable?\", \"What does it mean to say that someone knows something?\", and the fundamental question, \"How do we know that we know?\". The term 'Epistemology' was introduced to the philosophical field by the Scottish philosopher James Frederick Ferrier in 1854. However, according to Brett Warren, King James VI of Scotland had previously taken this philosophical concept by heart and personified it, with the term Epistemon, in 1591. In a In a philosophical debate, King James VI of Scotland wrote the character Epistemon as the personification of a philosophical concept to respond to a debate by arguing whether the perceptions developed by the ancient religion of witchcraft should be punished in the presence of Christian society. King James' argument shows that through the character of Epistemon, who bases his argument on theological ideas regarding reasoning and beliefs that develop in society, meanwhile his opponent Philomathes takes a philosophical stance on legal aspects in society, but seeks to gain greater knowledge of Epistemon, the Greek term for scientist.",

This dialogue was used by King James to educate the public on various concepts, including historical concepts and the etymology of the subject in dispute. Etymologically, this word comes from the classical Greek epist\u0113m\u0113 which means knowledge and logos which means explanation or knowledge. So epistemology is \"the theory of knowledge\" or the theory of knowledge. Using the term, epistemology is a branch of philosophy of science that examines and discusses the nature of science or knowledge about knowledge (scientific knowledge). The term terminologically, the word epistemology in English: \"epistemology\" which is the part of philosophy that deals with knowledge. Epistemology in Webster's New International Dictionary online, epistemology is defined as a study or theory regarding the nature and basis of knowledge, especially with reference to its limits and validity. Meanwhile, in terms of Indonesian terminology, the word epistemology in the online Big Indonesian Dictionary (KBBI) is defined as a branch of philosophy concerning the basis and limits of knowledge. So, it can be concluded that epistemology is a part or branch of philosophy that studies and discusses the occurrence of knowledge, sources of knowledge, origins of knowledge, limits, nature, methods and truth of knowledge. Literally, in the French expression \"doctrine de la Science\" or the doctrine of science, whose appearance the word term is followed in German: \"Wissenschaftslehre\" which means \"teaching of science\". In the Jena period (1794-1799), this term was used by thinkers named Johann Fichte and Bernard Bolzano for their various projects. Fichte uses the term \"Wissenschaftslehre\" as a free act in positioning oneself, setting, and primordial as a condition of all knowledge and experience. The use of the term in exclusively subjective practice is the first step of any scientific theory.",

The process of socialization is lifelong education through individual understanding and acceptance of their role in a group. Socialization can occur because there are primary agents, namely families with emotional and affective characteristics, and secondary agents, namely friends and associations that are flexible. The purpose of socialization is to teach the culture that applies in a group to individuals in terms of social roles and status. Peter L. Berger (1978) defines socialization as the process through which a child learns to become a participating member of society. This definition was presented by Berger in a study entitled Society in Man. According to Kamanto Sunarto, the definition presented by Berger shows the view that it is through socialization that (values) of society enter into human individuals. Based on its type, socialization is divided into two: primary socialization (in the family) and secondary socialization (in the community). According to Goffman, both processes take place in total institutions, namely the place of residence and place of work. In both institutions, there are a number of individuals in the same situation, separated from the wider community for a certain period of time, living together in a confined and formally regulated life.",

        "paragraph": "Peter L. Berger and Luckmann define primary socialization as the first socialization that an individual undergoes as a child by learning to become a member of society (family). Primary socialization takes place when children are 1-5 years old or when children have not yet entered school. Children start to recognize family member and family environment. Gradually he began to be able to differentiate himself from others around his family. In this stage, the role of the people closest to the child becomes very important because a child has limited interaction patterns in it. The color of the child's personality will be largely determined by the color of the personality and the interactions that occur between the child and his closest family members. Secondary socialization is an advanced socialization process after primary socialization that introduces individuals into certain groups in society. The forms are resocialization and desocialization. In the process of resocialization, a person is given a new identity. Meanwhile, in the process of desocialization, a person experiences a long 'revocation' of self-identity. According to Erving Goffman, the process of resocialization and desocialization is related to the function of social institutions. These social institutions include prisons and mental hospitals. The following is what Goffman means by social institutions: \"A place where a number of individuals in the same situation live and work, cut off from the wider community for a certain period of time, together leading a life that is confined and formally regulated.\" Each group of people has different standards and values. For example, the standard 'whether someone is good or not' in school and in the playgroup is certainly different. At school, for example, a person is called good if his test score is above seven or he has never been late for school. While in the playgroup, a person is said to be good if he is in solidarity with friends or helps each other.",

A maar or funnel volcano, is a volcano that has a broad but flattened volcanic crater formed by a phreatomagmatic eruption (an explosion that occurs when water comes into contact with hot lava or magma). A typical maar fills with water to form relatively shallow crater lakes which may also be called maars. the name originates from the local Moselle Franken dialect of Daun in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany, where it is derived from the Latin mare (sea). Maars are shallow, flat-floored craters that scientists interpret could have formed above diatremes as a result of the violent magmatic expansion of gas or vapor; deep erosion of the maar may expose the diatreme. Maars range in size from 60 to 8,000 m (200 to 26,250 ft) deep and from 10 to 200 m (33 to 656 ft) deep; most maars usually fill with water to form natural lakes. Most maars have low rims consisting of a loose mixture of volcanic rock fragments and rock ripped from the diatreme walls. The dry maar results when maar lakes dry up, become aggraded or silted up. The last example is Eckfelder Maar. Near Steffeln is Eichholzmaar (also called Gussweiher) which has dried up over the last century and is being renaturalised into a maar. In some cases the underlying rock is so porous that lake maar cannot form. After a winter of snow and rainfall many dry maars fill partially and temporarily with water; others contain a small marsh or often an artificial pond that, however, only occupies part of the hollow.",

These maars range in size from 4,000 to 8,000 m (13,000 to 26,000 ft) in diameter and up to 300 m (980 ft) in depth. These eruptions occurred over a period of about 100,000 years, with the youngest (Devil Mount Maar) occurring around 17,500 years ago. This large size is due to the explosive reaction that occurs when magma comes into contact with permafrost. Hydromagmatic eruptions are increasingly explosive when the ratio of water to magma is lower. Since permafrost thaws slowly, it provides a steady source of eruptive water while keeping the water for magma too low. This produced prolonged, explosive eruptions that created these massive maars. Examples of the Seward maar Peninsula include North Killeak Maar, South Killeak Maar, Devil's Mountain Maar Whitefish and Maar. Maars occur in western North America, Patagonia in South America, the Eifel region of Germany (where they were originally described), and other geologically young volcanic regions of Earth.

Bases are the opposite (dual) of acids, which are intended for chemical elements/compounds that have a pH of more than 7. Kostic is the term used for a strong base. Bases can be divided into strong bases and weak bases. The strength of a base is highly dependent on the ability of the base to release OH ions in solution and the concentration of the base solution. When dissolved in water, sodium hydroxide, which is a strong base, ionizes into sodium ions and hydroxide ions: at the same time, hydrochloric acid in water forms chloride ions and hydronium ions: When these 2 mixtures are combined, H3O+ and OH ions \u2212 will combine to form water: If the amount of NaOH and HCl dissolved is exactly the same, then the acid and base will be neutralized exactly, so there will only be a solution of NaCl (or table salt). A strong base is a type of simple compound that can deprotonate a very weak acid in an acid-base reaction. The most common examples of strong bases are the hydroxides of the alkali metals and alkaline earth metals such as NaOH and Ca(OH)2. The following is a list of strong bases: The cations from the above strong bases are in the first and second groups of the periodic list (alkaline and alkaline earth). An acid with a pKa of more than 13 is considered very weak, and its conjugate base is a strong base. Some strong bases such as calcium hydroxide are very insoluble in water.

Chemical reactions occur as a result of specific, regular interactions between molecules in the cell environment and their changes. Cells will stop working if metabolism does not take place in the body. Metabolism also plays a role in detoxification. The types of reactions that occur during metabolic processes are divided into catabolism and anabolism. Metabolic processes require the help of enzymes as activators. The three main goals of metabolism are converting food into energy to carry out processes at the cellular level, converting food into raw materials for building proteins, lipids, nucleic acids and several types of carbohydrates, and eliminating metabolic waste. These enzyme-catalyzed reactions enable organisms to grow, reproduce, maintain structures, and respond to their environment (the word metabolism can be defined as all the chemical reactions that occur in living organisms including digestion and the movement of substances within and between different cells) The group of reactions above that occur at the cellular level can be known as intermediary metabolism or intermediate metabolism). Chemical reactions in metabolic processes are divided into several metabolic pathways, where one compound can change through several processes into another compound. Each process is facilitated by a specific enzyme. In general, metabolism has a two-way pathway of organic chemical reactions: Both directions of the metabolic pathway are necessary for every organism to survive. The direction of the metabolic trajectory is determined by a compound known as a hormone, and is accelerated (catalyzed) by enzymes. In organic compounds, the determinant of the direction of a chemical reaction is called a promoter and the determinant of the acceleration of a chemical reaction is called a catalyst. In each direction of metabolism, chemical reactions involve a number of substrates that react with enzymes as catalysts in the reaction steps to produce intermediate compounds, which become substrates in the next reaction step.",

        "paragraph": "The entire chemical reactants involved in a reaction step is called the metabolome. All of this is studied in a branch of biology called metabolomics. Enzymes are crucial to metabolic processes because they allow an organism to regulate desired reactions that require energy not to occur by themselves by partnering with them. This pairing will produce a spontaneous reaction that will produce energy. Enzymes that function as catalysts will allow a reaction to run faster while at the same time regulating the rate of a metabolic reaction, for example in response to environmental changes experienced by cells or signals from other cells. The basal metabolic rate of an organism is a measure of the amount of energy consumed by all the chemical reactions that occur. The metabolic system of an organism determines which compounds are nutrients for the body or are toxic. For example, some types of prokaryotes use hydrogen sulfide as a nutrient, although this gas is toxic to animals. However, the specific features of metabolism are common in almost all the different species. For example, the known carboxylic acid group is an intermediate in the citric acid cycle, occurring in all known organisms. These compounds are also found in very different species such as the unicellular bacterium Eschirichia coli and large multicellular organisms such as elephants. The similarities in these metabolic pathways may be due to their presence in early evolutionary history and their retention due to their consequent efficacy. Cancer cell metabolism is very different from normal cells and this difference can be used as a therapeutic intervention in cancer. The term metabolism is derived from the French \"m\u00e9tabolism\" or Ancient Greek \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b2\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae \u2013 \"Metabole\" which is translated as \"a change\" which is derived from the word \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b2\u03ac\u03bb\u03bb \u2013 \"Metaballein\" which is translated as \"to change\" Aristotle's book entitled The Parts of Animals explains in sufficient detail about his views on metabolism which is described by an open flow diagram model.",

This language is most famously used by the Theravadins to write the collection of writings that became known as the P\u0101li Canon (or Tipitaka in P\u0101li and Tripitaka in Sanskrit), because it contains three groups of writings, namely the collection of rules (Vinaya), teachings (Suttas) and special teaching (Abhidhamma). In Buddhism, the Tipitaka is then seen as a holy book. The meaning of the Tipitaka in Pali is three groups or three baskets. This book was written in Sri Lanka in the first century BC. The P\u0101li language is written using the Brahmi script, Devanagari and so on. In the Latin script, the spelling system was coined by T. W. Rhys Davids of the Pali Text Society. The word P\u0101li itself means \"lines/lines\" or \"(canonical) text\" and is now classified as a literary language. While it is uncertain whether Pali was ever used as a vernacular; Pali has long been the language in which Theravada Buddhists chant their religious texts. Experts stated that the Buddha, Siddhartha Gautama was a speaker of Magadhi or another Middle Indo-Aryan language which is the language of the people living near the city of Benares (Varanasi), northeastern Central India. It was there that the Buddha resided and spread his teachings. The P\u0101li language is considered by Buddhists to be similar to the ancient Magadhi language, or even a continuation of it. But Magadhi is an east Indian language, while P\u0101li is most similar to the language spoken on west Indian inscriptions. Today P\u0101li is mainly studied to be able to study Buddhist texts, and it is often chanted.

However, some scholars such as AC Woolner believe that Pali derives from Vedic Sanskrit, but not necessarily from Classical Sanskrit. P\u0101li vocabulary has its roots in Sanskrit, but with a slightly different meaning, adapted to Buddhist teachings. Some of the rest of the P\u0101li vocabulary is rooted in the area of \u200b\u200buse of the language (For example, adding Sinhalese vocabulary to the P\u0101li vocabulary. Conversely, much of the Sinhalese vocabulary is derived from Pali). The P\u0101li vocabulary itself indicates that P\u0101li was used as a liturgical language or for teaching Buddhism. The similar vocabulary between Sanskrit and Pali shows a contradiction in meaning. For example, Buddhists do not believe in the existence of a soul or the essential nature of things, so the term \"dhamma\" is used to reflect this (in Sanskrit it means \"dharma\"). The philosophy contained in Sanskrit and P\u0101li is also contradictory and reflects the differences between Buddhist and Hindu thought in the Middle India period. Sanskrit vocabulary was seen as inherently part of the things or things they describe, whereas Pali vocabulary was seen as having only conventional resemblance. Pali and Sanskrit are very closely related, and common characteristics of Pali and Sanskrit are always easily recognized by those in India who are familiar with both.",

As an ethical understanding and view, relativism argues that good and evil, right and wrong depend on each person and the culture of society. Teachings such as this were held by Protagras, Pyrrho, and their followers, as well as by the Skeptics. Ethical relativism which argues that the judgment of right and wrong depends on each person is called subjective or analytical ethical relativism. The ethical relativism which argues that ethical judgments are not the same, because there are no similarities between society and culture is called cultural ethical relativism. According to subjective ethical relativism, emotions and feelings play an important role in ethical issues. Therefore, the influence of emotions and feelings in moral decisions must be taken into account. Good and evil, right and wrong cannot be separated from those who are involved and judge them. Ethical relativism argues that there are no absolute criteria for moral decisions. Westermarck embraced an ethical relativism that linked decision criteria to individual culture, which exhibited individual differences. Joseph Fletcher's situational ethics considers the morality of an action relative to the goodness of that action's purpose. The strength of subjective ethical relativism is its awareness that humans are unique and different from one another. Because of this, living people respond to life's twists and turns and make ethical judgments about life differently. That way humans can live according to the demands of the situation.

However, in quantum physics, organic chemistry, and biochemistry, the term molecule is often used somewhat loosely, also being used for polyatomic ions. In the kinetic theory of gases, the term molecule is often used for any gas particle regardless of its composition. According to this definition, noble gas atoms are considered as molecules as monatomic molecules. A molecule can be homonuclear, that is, it contains atoms of one chemical element, for example oxygen (O2); or it can also be heteronuclear, a chemical compound composed of more than one element, for example water (H2O). Atoms and complexes connected by non-covalent bonds, such as hydrogen bonds or ionic bonds, are generally considered to be single molecules. Molecules as components of plural matter are found in organic matter (and biochemistry of course). They make up most of the oceans and atmosphere. However, the majority of the solid matter known to us on Earth, including most of the minerals that make up Earth's crust, mantle, and core, contains many chemical bonds, but is not composed of identifiable molecules. In addition, there are no distinct molecules that can be defined as ionic crystals (salts) and covalent crystals (network solids), although these are often composed of unit cells that repeat so that they form a plane (as in graphene) or three dimensions ( such as diamond, quartz, or sodium chloride).

This definition is often contradicted by many substances in ordinary experience, such as rock, salt, and metals, consisting of a large crystalline network of chemically bonded atoms or ions, but not made of discrete molecules. Molecules are held together by covalent bonds or ionic bonds. Some types of non-metallic elements only exist as molecules in the environment. For example, hydrogen only exists as molecular hydrogen. A compound molecule is made of two or more elements. A covalent bond is a chemical bond that involves sharing of electron pairs between atoms. This pair of electrons is called a shared pair or bond pair, and the stable balance of attractive and repulsive forces between atoms, when they share electrons, is called a covalent bond.",

        "paragraph": "Sigmund Freud (6 May 1856 \u2013 23 September 1939) was an Austrian of Jewish descent and the founder of the school of psychoanalysis in the field of psychology. According to Freud, the life of the soul has three levels of consciousness, namely conscious, preconscious and unconscious. The most famous concept of Freud's theory is that there is a subconscious that controls most behavior. In addition, he also gave a statement that human behavior is based on sexual desire (eros) which is initially felt by humans since childhood from their mother. The sexual experience of the mother is like breastfeeding. Then it develops or is sublimated, giving rise to various other behaviors that are adapted to the rules of society's norms or father's norms. After his colleague, Alferd Adler, revealed that there is a death instinct in humans, even though Freud initially rejected Adler's statement by completely denying it. In the end, Freud aligns or does not leave only the sexual instinct that exists in humans, but juxtaposes it with the death instinct (Thanatos). Even so, he never mentioned that actually the origin of this theory was originally put forward by Adler. Freud became interested in and studied hypnosis in France, then used it to help people with mental illness. Freud later abandoned hypnosis after he succeeded in using new methods to treat sufferers of psychological distress, namely free association and dream analysis. The basis for creating this method comes from the concept of the subconscious. Free association is a method used to uncover problems that are suppressed by one's self but continue to push out without realizing it, causing problems, whereas dream analysis was used by Freud from his understanding that dreams are messages from the abstract subconscious to the conscious.",

These things become the core elements of psychoanalysis. Freud was especially interested in the condition that was then called hysteria and is now called conversion syndrome. Freud's theories and his way of treating patients caused controversy in nineteenth century Vienna and are still hotly debated today. Freud's ideas are usually discussed and analyzed as works of literature, philosophy, and general culture, as well as as an ongoing debate as these scientific and medical treatises. Freud is a prominent figure related to his opinions in the field of psychology. Many of the terms are used by the public, for example: ego, super ego, and the Oedipus complex.

His mother married his father when his mother was 19 years old. His father had two wives. He is the first child of his father and mother of the second wife. Freud's father worked as a merchant. His mother married when the child from his first wife was of an adult age. Freud had two half-brothers by his father's first wife. Freud's half-brother was almost the same age as his mother.

Its date of origin is unknown, although ceramics dating from around 1000 BC have been found within the city. This region is also important in Jainism and Buddhism as it was one of the favorite places for Venerable Mahavira and Gautama Buddha and the famous \"Atanatiya\" conference was held on Mount Vulture Peak (Gijjhakuta).

At first the term psychoanalysis was used only in relation to Freud, so that Freud's \"psychoanalysis\" and \"psychoanalysis\" were synonymous. When some of Freud's followers later deviated from his teachings and went their separate ways, they too abandoned the term psychoanalysis and chose a new name to denote their teachings. Notable examples are Carl Gustav Jung and Alfred Adler, who coined the names \"analytical psychology\" (English: analitycal psychology) and \"individual psychology\" (English: individual psychology) for their respective teachings. Psychoanalysis has three applications: Within the broad spectrum of psychoanalysis there are at least 20 theoretical orientations that underlie theories about the understanding of human mental activity and human development. The various approaches to the treatment of so-called \"psychoanalytic\" are as varied as the various theories. Freudian psychoanalysis, both theory and therapy based on Freud's ideas has become the basis for modern therapies and is one of the largest currents in psychology. In addition, the term psychoanalysis also refers to research methods of child development. Psychoanalysis is a type of therapy that aims to release pent up or repressed emotions and memories. In other words, the goal of psychoanalysis is to bring to the surface what is in the subconscious.

Immediately after graduating, he opened private practice and began treating patients with psychological disorders. Freud had an interesting experience from a colleague and a patient; his partner is Dr. Josef Breuer and his patient, known as \"Anna O.,\", suffered from physical symptoms for no apparent physical cause. Dr Breuer found that her symptoms subsided when he helped her recover memories of traumatic experiences that she had kept hidden from her conscious mind. This incident sparked Freud's interest in the unconscious mind and led to the development of several ideas in the field of psychoanalysis. Sigmund Freud assumed that the initial driving energy of human behavior comes from within humans which lies deep in the subconscious. That is why so many physical ailments are caused by a person's psychological distress. That psychological pressure was pressed into one's subconscious. According to Freud, the life of the soul has three levels of consciousness, namely conscious, preconscious and unconscious. This topography or awareness map is used to describe the element of awareness in every mental event such as thinking and fantasizing. Until the early 1920s, theories about psychological conflict only involved these three elements of consciousness. Only in 1923 did Freud recognize three other structural models, namely the id, ego, and superego. This new structure does not replace the old structure, but completes and perfects the mental picture, especially in its function or purpose. The six supporting elements of the personality structure are as follows: Conscious (Conscious) The original level of consciousness that we observe at a particular moment.

Green plants are included in the category of autotrophs (able to produce their own food). Almost all plant members are autotrophic, that is, they produce their own energy by converting sunlight energy through a process called photosynthesis in cell organelles called chloroplasts. Due to the dominant green color in members of this kingdom, another name used is Viridiplantae (\"green plants\"). Another name is Metaphyta.

Natural philosophy can be found in the civilizations of Mesopotamia, Egypt, India and China. However, the origins of, and approaches to, modern biology date back to Ancient Greece. Although medical research can be traced back to the time of Hippocrates (ca. 460 BC\u2013ca. 370 BC), Aristotle (384 BC\u2013322 BC) was the figure most credited with developing biology. One of his most important works is Historia Animalium, and several other works that show the point of view of a natural researcher, as well as his empirical works that try to study biological causation and biodiversity. Aristotle's successor at the Lyceum, Theophrastus, wrote books on botany that were influential into the Middle Ages. Medieval Islamic scientists who studied biology included al-Jahiz (781\u2013869), Ad-Dinawari (828\u2013896), who wrote on botany, and ar-Razi (865\u2013925), who wrote on anatomy, and physiology.

The investigations carried out by Jan Swammerdam sparked interest in the field of entomology, and helped develop techniques for surgery, and microscopic staining. Advances in microscopy also greatly influenced thinking about biology. In the early 19th century, a number of biologists began to recognize the importance of the cell concept. Then, in 1838, Schleiden, and Schwann began advocating the (now widely accepted) idea that (1) the basic unit of organisms is the cell, and (2) each cell has the characteristics of life, although they opposed the idea that (3) all cells come from the division of other cells.",

The people who were influenced by Abdullah bin Saba' continued to pit the companions against each other. Their efforts were successful. Friends have a misunderstanding about the legal case of killing Caliph Uthman ra. The first comes from ummul mu'minim, Sayyidatina Aisyah ra, who was with Sayyidina Thalhah ra and the second is with Sayyidina Zubair ra. They were successfully pitted against each other until the Jamal War or the Camel War occurred. And then by Sayyidina Muawiyah ra who was appointed by Sayyidina Uthman ra as governor in Sham, resulting in the Shiffin War. Seeing the large number of sacrifices from the Muslim community, the disputing parties held ishlah or reconciliation. The rebels are not happy with the peace between the Muslims. Then there was a rebellion by those who initially pretended/hypocritical and they are the group called Khawarij. reference needed] The Khawarij wanted to seize the caliphate. However, they were prevented by Sayyidina Ali and Sayyidina Muawiyah ra, so they planned to kill them both. Ibn Muljam from the Khawarij managed to kill the caliph, Sayyidina Ali ra when he was leading the dawn prayer in Kufa, but not against Sayyidina Muawiyah ra because he was closely guarded. Even Sayyidina Muawiyah ra succeeded in consolidating himself and the Muslims, thanks to his political skills and the rigidity of his leadership.",

There is no general agreement on its exact scope or epistemological status. Mathematics has always thrived, for example in China in 300 BC, in India in 100 AD, and in Arabia in 800 AD, until the Renaissance, when new mathematical discoveries interacted with new scientific discoveries leading to a rapid increase in the rate of discovery. mathematics. Continuing today, mathematics is used around the world as an important tool in a variety of fields, including natural sciences, engineering, medicine/medical sciences, and social sciences such as economics, and psychology. Applied mathematics, the branch of mathematics concerned with the application of mathematical knowledge to other fields, inspires and makes use of new mathematical discoveries, and sometimes leads to the development of entirely new disciplines, such as statistics and game theory. Mathematics is widely used in science for modeling phenomena. This allows the extraction of quantitative estimates from the experimental laws. For example, the motions of planets can be predicted with high accuracy using Newton's laws of gravity combined with mathematical calculations. The independence of the mathematical truth of any experiment implies that the accuracy of such an estimate depends only on the adequacy of the model to describe reality. So, when there are some imprecise estimates, it means that the model has to be corrected or changed, it doesn't mean that the math is wrong. For example, Mercury's apse or perihelium precession cannot be explained by Newton's laws of gravity, but it is accurately described by Einstein's general relativity.",

Mathematics is important in many fields, including natural sciences, engineering, medicine, finance, computer science, and social sciences. Several areas of mathematics, such as statistics and game theory, were developed in direct correlation with their applications, and are often grouped under the name applied mathematics. Other areas of mathematics were developed independently of any application (and are therefore called pure mathematics), but practical applications are often found later. A good example is the prime factorization problem, which was referenced to Euclid, but which had no practical application prior to its use in the RSA cryptosystem (for computer network security). The word \"mathematics\" comes from the Ancient Greek: \u03bc\u03ac\u03b8\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1 (m\u00e1th\u0113ma), which means \"that which is studied,\" \"what one wants to know,\" thus also means \"study\" and \"science\". The word for \"mathematics\" had a narrower and more technical meaning \"the study of mathematics\" even in Classical times. The adjective is math\u0113matik\u00f3s (\u03bc\u03b1\u03b8\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2), meaning \"related to learning\" or \"studying hard,\" which in turn means \"mathematical\".

Similarly, one of the two main schools of thought within Pythagoreanism was known as the math\u0113matikoi (\u03bc\u03b1\u03b8\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03af)\u2014which at the time meant \"student\" rather than \"mathematician\" in the modern sense. In Latin, and in English until about 1700, the term mathematics more often meant \"astrology\" (or sometimes \"astronomy\") than \"mathematics\"; the meaning gradually changed to what it is understood today from the 1500's to the 1800's. This resulted in several erroneous translations. For example, Saint Augustine's warning call that Christians should be wary of mathematici, meaning astrologers, is sometimes mistranslated as a mathematician's curse.",

After the Dacians attacked the Roman province of Moesia in 87, Emperor Trajan launched the Dacian Wars which ended in a Roman victory in 106. As a result of this victory, Dacia became the Roman province of Dacia. The large amount of iron ore, gold and silver found in the province caused the Romans to colonize the Dacia region. The process of colonization brought with it Vulgar Latin and started a period of romanization, which would give rise to the proto-Romanian languages. In the 3rd century nomadic tribes such as the Goths carried out many invasions, forcing the Romans around 271 to withdraw from Dacia, making it the first province to be abandoned by the Romans.

Hydrophile is the water pollination of aquatic plants which release their pollen directly into the surrounding water, either at the surface of the water or submerged in the water. In hydrophilic pollination, pollen grains have a density heavier than water, so the stamens sink and stick to the stigma. Approximately 98% of abiotic pollination is anemophilous, while the remaining 2% is hydrophilic, i.e. pollination with the help of water. Biotic pollination is a pollination process that requires organisms that carry or transfer pollen from the anther to the receptive part of the pistil. About 80% of plants pollinate biotically. The type of gymnosperm at biotic pollination generally occurs at a particular time when pollination occurs, although some gymnosperms and organisms adapt to the pollination process. Well-known examples are members of the order Cycadales and related species of beetles.",

        "paragraph": "Most anemophilous conifers depend on wind pollination. The different characteristics of various flowers (and their combinations) attract one type or another which is known as a pollination syndrome. In the wild, there are about 200,000 species of animals that pollinate most of them are insects. Entomophily, pollination by insects, often occurs in plants that have colored flower petals and a strong scent to attract insects such as bees, wasps and ants (Hymenoptera), beetles (Coleoptera), moths and butterflies (Lepidoptera), and flies (Diptera). ). In zoophilia, pollination is carried out by vertebrate animals such as bats and birds, in particular, hummingbirds, pijantung, sriganti honeybirds, and fruit bats. Plants that use bats or moths as pollinators usually have white petals and a strong scent. Whereas plants that use birds as pollinators tend to develop red petals and rarely develop a scent (some birds rely on their sense of smell to find food). Anthropophilia, pollination by humans, is commonly used in hybridization techniques or for plants that require human assistance such as dragon fruit, vanilla, and plants grown in greenhouses. In agriculture, pollination management is a branch of agriculture that aims to protect and enhance the pollinating organisms present and often involves the culture and addition of the pollination process in monoculture situations, such as commercial orchards. The largest managed pollination activity in the world is in California almond orchards, where nearly half (about one million hives) of US honeybees are trucked to almond orchards each spring. New York City apple plants need about 30,000 hives, blue berry plants use about 50,000 hives each year. Bees are also brought into the commercial cultivation of cucumbers, squash, melons, strawberries, and other crops.",

This country was ruled by the Ismailis, a branch of the Shiites. The leaders were also Shia priests, so they had religious interests in Isma'iliyyun. Sometimes this dynasty is also called Bani Ubaidillah, according to the name of the founder of the dynasty. The Fatimids had their origins in what is now Tunisia (\"Ifriqiya\") but after the conquest of Egypt around 971, the capital was moved to Cairo. During the Fatimid period, Egypt became the center of power which included North Africa, Sicily, the African Red Sea coast, Palestine, Syria, Yemen, and the Hijaz. During the Fatimid period, Egypt developed into a vast trading center in the Mediterranean and Indian Ocean, which determined the economic course of Egypt during the Late Middle Ages that Europe was then experiencing.

Slavery usually occurred with enslaved people being made to do some form of work and their location also being determined by the person who owned them. Historically, when people were enslaved, it was often because that person was in debt, broke the law, or suffered a military defeat: The duration of their slavery could be a lifetime, or a period of time before they were granted freedom. An individual is usually enslaved against his will or under duress, although there is also voluntary slavery done to pay debts or to obtain money for a specific purpose. Throughout human history, slavery has been an aspect of civilization, and was once legal in most of the world's societies, but is now outlawed in all countries of the world. In traditional slavery (chattel slavery), people who are legally enslaved are considered the private property (chattel) of the slave owner. In economics, the term de facto slavery refers to the forced labor conditions experienced by the majority of slaves. In 2019, around 40 million people, of whom 26 percent were children, were enslaved worldwide despite being illegal. In the modern world, more than 50 percent of people are enslaved to perform forced labor, usually in factories in a country's private sector. In industrialized countries, human trafficking is a modern form of slavery; in non-industrialized countries, debt bondage is a common form of enslavement, such as captive domestic service, forced marriage, and child soldiers.

Use of the word arose during the Early Medieval Period, when Slavic peoples from Central and Eastern Europe (Saqaliba) were often enslaved by Moors from the Iberian Peninsula and North Africa. There is debate among historians about whether terms such as \"forced laborers\" or \"enslaved persons\" were better used than \"slaves\" for victims of slavery. According to those who proposed changing the terminology, the term slave perpetuated the crime of slavery by reducing its victims to nouns and non-humans. Other historians prefer slaves because the term is more familiar and shorter, or because it accurately reflects the inhumane practice of slavery, and vice versa, one might say, implicitly indicating a degree of autonomy possessed that slavery simply did not exist. As an institutionalized social practice, traditional slavery denies human agency or autonomy and legally degrades their human status and status into goods (chattel) owned by their owners; therefore slaves are supposed to give birth to slaves; children of slaves were also born as slaves, under the legal doctrine of 2100 BC, the Law of Ur-Nammu (\"4.

In conducting studies on humans, anthropology puts forward two important concepts, namely: Holistic and Comparative. Because of that, anthropological studies pay great attention to historical aspects and a thorough explanation to describe humans through knowledge of social sciences, life sciences (nature), and also the humanities. Anthropology aims to better understand and appreciate humans as biological entities, homo sapiens and social beings within an interdisciplinary and comprehensive framework. Therefore, anthropology uses the theory of biological evolution in providing meaning and historical facts in explaining the journey of mankind on earth since its inception. Anthropology also uses cross-cultural studies in emphasizing and explaining differences between human groups in the perspective of material culture, social behavior, language, and way of life. With its holistic orientation, anthropology is divided into four interrelated branches, namely: Biological Anthropology, Socio-Cultural Anthropology, Archeology, and Linguistics. The four branches have their own concentration studies in academic specialties and scientific research, with unique topics and different research methods. Anthropology was born or originated from Europeans' interest in the physical characteristics, customs, and culture of other ethnicities that were different from the people known in Europe. At that time, anthropological studies focused more on the population which was a single society, single in the sense of a community unit that lived in the same geographical area, had similar physical characteristics and used language, and had the same way of life.

Anthropology builds on knowledge from the natural sciences, including discoveries about the origin and evolution of Homo sapiens, human physical characteristics, human behavior, variations among various human groups, how the evolutionary past of Homo sapiens has influenced social organization and culture. As well as from the social sciences, anthropology studies the organization of social and cultural human relations, systems of descent and kinship relations, spirituality and religion, institutions, social conflicts, and so on. Early anthropology came from classical Greece and Persia which studied and tried to understand the diversity of cultures that can be observed. By this time, anthropology (late 20th century) had become central to the development of several new interdisciplinary fields such as cognitive science, globalization studies, genetics, and various ethnic studies. Broadly speaking, anthropology consists of: Biological Anthropology or also called Physical Anthropology is a branch of anthropology that studies humans and non-human primates (non-human primates) in terms of biology, evolution, and demography.

Moral in consequentialism is based on the selection of the results of actions that provide the greatest benefit. Consequentialism is one of the principles applied in utilitarianism. In addition, consequentialism is also applied in hedonism. The term consequentialism was first used in 1957 by Elizabeth Anscombe. In consequentialism, an action is performed not only with respect to the consequences of that action. The consequences of an action must first be chosen based on the level of goodness. An action can generally produce several equally valuable consequences, so it is necessary to select the most valuable consequence to work on. The views of consequentialism and deontological ethics began to be used for intellectual property rights because of the difficulty in justifying ownership rights to objects as part of them. Protection does not get a guarantee if it is only based on a legal and constitutional basis. Therefore, another basis of protection is needed which is independent and applies as a rule. This thinking developed in United States jurisprudence. The principle of consequentialism is part of the deontological ethics of utilitarianism. This is due to his view which determines that the ethical quality of an action is determined by the consequences of his actions and not because of the action itself. Good deeds are only valued as good when they produce the greatest benefit. Meanwhile, good deeds that do not produce any benefit are not considered good. Consequentialism is also related to teleological studies on utilitarianism which judges actions based on goals. The teleological system also judges actions by their consequences.

Using humanist techniques to work on texts, he compiled important new editions of the Greek and Latin New Testaments, giving rise to issues that would later influence the Protestant Reformation and Counter-Reformation (Catholicism).

Erasmus opposed the European religious reforms that were developing in his time, but he was critical of abuses within the Catholic Church and called for reforms. He kept his distance from Martin Luther and Philip Melanchthon and continued to recognize the authority of the pope, emphasizing a middle way with a deep respect for grace, piety, and faith according to tradition, rejecting Luther's emphasis on faith alone. Erasmus remained a member of the Roman Catholic Church throughout his life, remaining committed to reforms from within the Church and the abuses committed by its clerics. He also adhered to the Catholic doctrine of free will, which some reformers rejected because of their predestination doctrine.

Information about Erasmus' family and early life comes mainly from the vague references in his writings. His parents are said to be legally unmarried. Gerard's father was a fellow priest in Gouda.

        "paragraph": "The hydrosphere is the layer of water that is on the surface of the earth. The formation of the hydrosphere comes from various sources of water on earth. The word hydrosphere comes from the English word hydrosphere; hydro means water and sphere means circle or scope. So, the hydrosphere is the layer of water that covers the earth. The hydrosphere on the surface of the earth includes lakes, rivers, seas, oceans, snow or glaciers, groundwater and water vapor contained in the air layer. The hydrologic cycle is a process of circulation or recycling of water sequentially and continuously. Sunlight has an effect on the hydrologic cycle. Water on the entire surface of the earth will evaporate when exposed to sunlight. At a certain height, when the temperature drops, water vapor will condense and turn into water droplets and fall as rain. The hydrologic cycle is divided into three, namely short cycle, medium cycle and long cycle. In the short cycle, seawater that is exposed to the sun's heat evaporates into gas so that it condenses before it reaches the land and forms clouds, resulting in rain on the sea surface. On the medium cycle, water vapor originating from the ocean is blown by the wind towards the mainland. On land water vapor forms clouds which eventually fall as rain over land. The rainwater will flow through rivers, ditches and so on until it returns to the sea... In a long cycle, water vapor originating from the ocean is blown by the wind onto the land. There is cooling that reaches the freezing point at a certain height, making clouds containing ice crystals form. These clouds drop hail or snow on the mountains. On the surface of the earth, ice flows in the form of glaciers, enters rivers and then returns to the oceans.",

The Process of the Hydrological Cycle To form a hydrological cycle there are several processes that occur within it, including evaporation, transpiration, sublimation, interception, condensation, advection, precipitation, run off, and infiltration. Waters on land are classified as fresh waters, namely all waters that cross land. Ground water includes groundwater and surface water. Groundwater is water that is found in the ground. Groundwater comes from snow, rain or other forms of precipitation that seep into the ground and are stored in an impermeable layer. Phreatic water is groundwater that lies on an impermeable layer not far from the ground surface. Phreatic water is strongly influenced by the absorption of water around it. In the dry season the amount of phreatic water decreases. Conversely, during the rainy season, the amount of phreatic water will increase. Phreatic water can be taken from wells or springs. Artesian water is groundwater that lies deep in the ground, between two impermeable layers. The layer between the two impermeable layers is called the aquifer layer. This layer holds a lot of water. If the waterproofing layer cracks, water will naturally escape onto the surface. The water that gushes to the surface is called an artesian spring. Artesian water can be obtained by drilling. The well drilled is called an artesian well... Surface water is a container of water that is found on the surface of the earth. Forms of surface water include rivers, lakes, swamps. River is rainwater or spring water that flows naturally through a valley or between two banks with clear boundaries, towards a lower place (ocean, lake or other river).",

Jaina means the religion of conquest. It is intended to subdue the natures of lust in the order of human life. The Jaina religion was founded by Nataputta Vardhamana, who lived in 559\u2013527 BC who was called Mahawira, which means great hero. Jaina religion was born before Buddhism. Buddhism has a wider following outside India, but Jaina religion is limited to India only. Both religions are a reaction to the conditions within Hinduism regarding the development of its teachings in the past. Today there are more than 8 million followers of this religion. They are mainly found in India. Socially, Jainism adherents usually belong to the upper middle class. The Jaina religion has inherited temple buildings which are very famous for their architectural beauty in India and are always visited by tourists. The closest Jaina term to \"scripture\" is religion, the \"arrival\" of a set of doctrines through transmission by authoritative gurus and clear lineages, that is, \"enlightened\" people who have discovered the truth of ahimsa. Religion is summed up in an oft-quoted statement: \u201cThe Decent Man follows the meaning, then the disciples compose the suttas (sacred texts), and then the sacred texts proceed for the good of the doctrines.\u201d This is what makes the meaning of a text separate from its words. What's more, the sutta means \"indication\" - something that only hints at or points to a meaning that can only be fully explained by a qualified teacher. Through this, it can be seen that this three-layered process also occurs in the story of Mahavira. After his enlightenment, it is reported that he preached at the tree spirit temple before the king and queen of Champa, as well as a large crowd of ascetics, gods, lay people, and animals.",

He narrates eternal and immutable truths which, like the universe itself, have no beginning and have been conveyed by \u201cenlightened humans\u201d in previous eras. The Sutta does not record Mahavira's own words, but is simply a commentary on his message. This perhaps explains the strong belief of Jains that their scriptures are incomplete and that important truths have been lost \u2013 a theme we encounter in other traditions as well. It is said that each of the 24 tithankaras taught the doctrine of ahimsa to his circle of disciples, and that at each age the disciples recorded the teachings of the guru in the fourteen scriptures. However, tragically after the death of each tithankara, the disciples responsible for imparting the teachings died in a famine, resulting in the loss of important teachings. Therefore, whenever a tithankara dies, the Jains always get only an incomplete canon of scriptures. The few remaining holy books only enshrine doctrines that are less important and are intended for women and children, because only men are capable of understanding higher teachings. The Jains try to correct the weaknesses of their method of transmitting scriptures through a series of sidings (vacana). The first council was held in the mid-3rd century BC at Pataliputra, and the second and third councils were held in the 4th and 5th centuries AD. A more accurate translation of vacana is \"discourse\" or \"recitation\". There is no intellectual debate in these sessions; participants listened to the monks recite the holy books they had memorized. According to Karen Armstrong, Jainism is often seen as atheistic.",

This scientific branch aims to reveal about the life of an organism and what influences it. Biogeography includes the analysis and explanation of distribution patterns combined with an understanding of changes in the distribution of living things from the past to the present. The main study in biogeography discusses the historical development of groups of organisms. The observed developments relate to the origin, spread, and the relationship between the present distribution in explaining past history. The focus of the discussion of biogeography lies in the interaction of organisms with the physical environment and interactions between organisms. Biogeography also studies the relationships that influence the species and taxa found today. Biogeography is divided into regions and sub-regions with reference to the degree of human intervention. Markers for biogeographical regions and sub-regions are sign systems that use letter symbols and a decimal system. This marker serves to describe an ecosystem with a concise and globally understood formula. Science doesn't just ask What species? and Where?, but he also asks Why? and sometimes Why not?. In biogeography, historical approaches and ecological factors are used to study the distribution of flora and fauna in the world. The historical approach views biogeography from the aspects of the development and evolution of organisms, which are influenced by climate, migration, past developments on the earth's surface, and its relationship with the present environment. The ecological point of view views biogeography from the point of view of the relationship between the organism itself and the environment and its influences. The pattern of distribution of species at this level can be explained by a combination of hereditary factors such as speci\ufb01cation, extinction, continental drift, glaciation (which is also related to sea level, river channels and related matters), as well as river capture and availability of natural resources.",

The term biogeography was introduced by biologists, namely Robert H. MacArthur and E.O. Wilson in the 1960s, which is a field of science that contains biological evolution, namely discussions about biology, ecology, genetics, geography, and paleontology, which are used to determine the distribution of species. Biogeography was developed and popularized by early naturalists such as Carl von Linne, Alexander von Humbolt, Edward Forbes, Joseph Hooker, Louis Agassiz, Alfred R. Wallace, and Charles Darwin, who originally classified different aspects of plants. Molecular biologists define biogeography as the study of gene lineage, while ecologists consider biogeography to be the study of ecosystems and geographic distribution. Biogeography is also known as learning related to the biosphere, which contains the physical nature around it, both soil, animals and plants. Biogeographic regions are shaped by the presence of climate. The types of organisms that live in an area are determined by one of the climatic elements, namely humidity. Moisture levels are determined by sunlight and soil temperature in an environment. Plant development and biodiversity are determined by rainfall. Heavy rainfall supports the growth of large trees. On the other hand, little rainfall favors the development of short trees, shrubs, grasses, and desert plants. Rainfall and soil temperature in an area are directly proportional to the number of plants that can develop in an area. Climatic conditions greatly affect the state of plants, while the state of vegetation affects the existence of certain types of animals. The state of the fauna in each area (biome) largely depends on the possibilities that area can provide for providing food.",

In developing countries, diarrhea is the most common cause of death for children under five, and also kills more than 2.6 million people each year. This condition can be a symptom of injury, disease, allergies (fructose, lactose), excess vitamin C, and consuming certain fruits. Usually accompanied by abdominal pain and sometimes nausea and vomiting. There are other conditions that involve but not all of the symptoms of diarrhea, and the official medical definition of diarrhea is stools in excess of 200 grams per day. Eating foods that are sour, spicy, or coconut milk in excess can also cause diarrhea because it shocks the intestines. This occurs when insufficient fluid is absorbed by the large intestine. As part of the digestion process, or due to fluid intake, food is mixed with large amounts of water. Therefore digested food consists of liquids before it reaches the large intestine. The large intestine absorbs water, leaving other materials as semi-solid waste. If the large intestine is damaged/inflamed, absorption does not occur and the result is watery feces. Diarrhea is mostly caused by some viral infection but is also often the result of bacterial toxins. In clean living conditions and with adequate food and water available, healthy patients usually recover from common viral infections within a few days and as long as a week. However, for sick or malnourished individuals, diarrhea can cause severe dehydration and can be life-threatening without treatment. Diarrhea can be a symptom of a more serious disease, such as dysentery, cholera or botulism, and it can also be indicative of a chronic syndrome such as Crohn's disease.",

Symptoms that are usually found are continuous bowel movements accompanied by prolonged heartburn, dehydration, nausea and vomiting. But other symptoms that can arise include back pain, and frequent stomach sounds. Treatment of diarrhea involves the patient consuming sufficient amounts of water to replace what is lost, preferably mixed with electrolytes to provide the required salt and some nutrients.

PVC can be made more elastic and flexible by adding plasticizers, generally phthalates. Flexible PVC is commonly used as clothing, piping, roofing, and electrical cable insulation. PVC is produced by polymerizing vinyl chloride monomer (CH2=CHCl). Because 57% of its mass is chlorine, PVC is a polymer that uses the lowest petroleum raw material among other polymers. The production process used in general is suspension polymerization. In this process, vinyl chloride monomer and water are introduced to the polymerization reactor and polymerization initiator, along with chemical additives to initiate the reaction. The ingredients in the reaction vessel are continuously mixed to maintain suspension and ensure uniformity of the particle size of the PVC resin. The reaction is exothermic, and requires a cooling mechanism to maintain the reactor at the required temperature. As the volume contracts during the reaction (PVC is denser than vinyl chloride monomer), water is continuously added to the mixture to maintain suspension. When the reaction is complete, the resultant liquid PVC must be separated from the excess vinyl chloride monomer to be reused for the next reaction. Then the finished PVC liquid will be centrifuged to separate the excess water. The liquid is then dried with hot air and the resulting PVC granules are produced. In normal operation, the excess of vinyl chloride monomer in PVC is only less than 1 PPM.

Before PVC becomes the final product, it usually requires conversion by adding heat stabilizer, UV stabilizer, lubricant, plasticizer, process aid, thermal regulator, filler, flame retardant, biocide, developer, and selected pigment. PVC was discovered by accident by Henri Victor Regnault in 1835 and Eugen Baumann in 1872. In the early 20th century, Russian chemists Ivan Ostromislensky and Fritz Klatte of the German chemical company Griesheim-Elektron tried to establish the use of PVC as a commercial product. However, the difficulty of stiffening the material hindered their efforts. In 1926, Waldo Semon and the B. F. Goodrich company developed a method of making PVC 'completely plastic' by adding various additives. As a result, PVC becomes more flexible and easier to process which then achieves widespread use. 1 The attractive properties of PVC make it suitable for a wide variety of uses. PVC is biologically and chemically resistant, making it the plastic of choice as a material for household drainpipes and other piping where corrosion is a barrier to metal piping. With the addition of various anti-pressure and stabilizer materials, PVC is becoming a popular material for window and door frames. With the addition of a plasticizer, PVC becomes elastic enough to be used as a cable insulator. PVC has been used extensively in clothing, making leather-like materials. PVC is cheaper than rubber, leather, or latex and so it is widely used. PVC is also waterproof, so it is used as a material for making jackets, coats and bags. PVC used as electrical cable insulation must use a plasticizer to make it more elastic. However, if exposed to fire, cables covered with PVC will produce HCl fumes and become a material that is hazardous to health.",

In 323 BC, Alexander the Great, while conquering the Persian Empire, also launched an invasion of India. After that came the powerful states in India. The first was the Mauryan Empire which was founded in 321 BC and collapsed in 184 BC. This was followed by a period of minor kingdoms until in 320 AD the Gupta Empire lasted until 550 AD. Other major kingdoms also appeared in southern India. Starting around 400 AD, waves of attacks from Central Asia and West Asia began to invade India. Initially, the Huns attacked, then, after the fall of the Guptas, the Muslims managed to capture northern India and establish the Delhi Sultanate. Around the 1200s and 1300s AD, the Mongols also made repeated attacks on India. All these conflicts took place mainly in northern India. Meanwhile in southern India, the local Indian kingdoms were relatively undisturbed.

The reddish-orange appearance of the Martian surface is due to the presence of iron(III) oxide, which is better known as hematite. Based on orbital observations and examination of the Martian meteorite assemblage, the surface of Mars is composed of basalt. Some evidence suggests that parts of the Martian surface are richer in silica than ordinary basalt, and may be similar to Earth's andesitic rocks. Most of the surface of Mars is covered with iron(III) oxide dust, which gives it a red appearance. Currently Mars does not have a global magnetic field, but observations show that some of the planet's crust is magnetized, and a global magnetic field did exist in the past. One theory, announced in 1999 and re-examined in October 2005 (with the assistance of the Mars Global Surveyor) suggests that four billion years ago, Mars' dynamo stopped functioning and caused its magnetic field to disappear.

Curling is still related to bowling, boules and shuffleboard. Two teams, each consisting of 4 players, take turns launching granite stones towards a target area called the house. The target area (house) is on opposite sides of the track, and is marked with red and blue circles. The playing field is called a sheet, in the form of a rectangular track that has a smooth, ice-covered surface. The granite stone that is played is granite that has been polished, so that it can be launched on the surface of ice by being pushed. Stones are given different colors to distinguish their own stones from the opponent's stones. One team gets 8 stones for one round (end). The aim of the game is to collect as many numbers as possible. Points are earned by the team that has the closest stone to the center of the house at the end of each round (when all the stones have been launched). In an effort to dominate the house with one's own stone, the opponent's stone may be hit so that it is pushed out of the house. When the stone has been released by a teammate, two players carrying a brush (broom) are tasked with directing the stone towards the target by rubbing the brush in front of the path the stone will pass. The surface of the ice when brushed will make the stone slide further or slightly change the direction of the stone. This game requires a mature strategy, played in turns at a relaxed tempo, so it's like chess and baseball. The game of curling is thought to have been invented in the late Middle Ages in Scotland.

The game of curling existed in Scotland in the early 16th century, based on the discovery of evidence of a curling stone inscribed with the year 1511 (found along with another stone written with the year 1551) in an old drained pool in Dunblane, Scotland.

The main biological functions of lipids are to store energy, play a role in signaling, and act as a building component of cell membranes. Lipids are used in the cosmetic and food industries as well as in nanotechnology. Lipids can be broadly defined as hydrophobic or amphiphilic small molecules; The amphiphilic nature of some lipids allows them to form structures such as vesicles, multilamellar/unilamellar liposomes, or membranes in aquatic environments. Biological lipids are derived, wholly or in part, from two distinct types of biochemical subunits or \"building-blocks\", namely ketoacyl and isoprene groups. Using this approach, lipids can be divided into eight categories: fatty acids, glycerolipids, glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, saccharolipids, and polyketides (derived from the condensation of ketoacyl subunits); and sterol lipids and prenol lipids (derived from condensation of isoprene subunits). Although the term lipid is sometimes used as a synonym for fat, it is a subgroup of lipids called triglycerides. Lipids also include molecules such as fatty acids and their derivatives (including tri-, di-, monoglycerides, and phospholipids), as well as other sterol-containing metabolites such as cholesterol. Although humans and other mammals use various biosynthetic pathways to break down and synthesize lipids, some essential lipids cannot be made in this way and must be obtained from the diet. Fatty acids (or fatty acid residues when they are part of a lipid) are groups of molecules synthesized by chain elongation of an acetyl-CoA primary with a malonyl-CoA or methylmalonyl-CoA group in a process called fatty acid synthesis. They are formed from a hydrocarbon chain terminated by a carboxylic acid group; This arrangement gives the fatty acid molecule a polar, hydrophilic end and a nonpolar, water-insoluble hydrophobic end.",

        "paragraph": "The fatty acid structure is one of the most fundamental groupings of biological lipids, and is widely used as a building block for most of the more complex lipids. The carbon chains, usually between four and 24 carbons in length, can be either saturated or unsaturated, and can be bonded to functional groups containing oxygen, halogens, nitrogen, and sulfur. If a fatty acid contains double bonds, it is possible that it has cis or trans geometric isomers, which significantly affect the configuration of the molecule. The cis- double bond causes the fatty acid chain to bend and results in the multiplication of the double bonds in the carbon chain. The three double bonds in linolenic acid (C-18), the most abundant acyl fatty chain in the thylakoid membrane, makes this membrane very \"fluid\" even at low ambient temperatures. This also makes linolenic acid display sharp peaks in the chloroplast spectrum when viewed with high-resolution C-13 NMR. This in turn plays an important role in the structure and function of the cell membrane. Most naturally occurring fatty acids have a cis configuration, although trans forms exist in some natural or partially hydrogenated fats and oils. Examples of biologically important fatty acids are the eicosanoid group, which are mainly derived from arachidonic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid, which include prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and thromboxane. Docosahexanoic acid is also important in biological systems, especially those related to vision. The other major classes in the fatty acid category are fatty esters and fatty amides. Fatty esters include important biochemical intermediates such as wax esters, coenzyme A thioester fatty acid derivatives, ACP thioester fatty acid derivatives, and carnitine fatty acid.

The acceleration of an object is caused by a force acting on the object, as explained in Newton's second law. The SI unit for acceleration is meters per second squared (m s\u22122). Acceleration is a vector quantity, so it has both magnitude and direction. As a vector, the total force is equal to the product of the object's mass (a scalar quantity) and its acceleration. Generally, acceleration is seen as the movement of an object getting faster or slower. In other words, an object that is turning (for example a car that is turning a corner) also has acceleration too. Average acceleration is the ratio of the object's change in velocity (\u0394v){\\displaystyle (\\Delta \\mathbf {v} )} to the time it takes for it to reach a change in velocity (\u0394t){\\displaystyle (\\Delta t)}. the speed changed. Mathematically, the average acceleration is formulated: Instantaneous acceleration, is the limit of the average acceleration per very small time interval. In calculus, instantaneous acceleration is the vector derivative of velocity with respect to time: (Here and everywhere, if motion is in a straight line, the vector quantity can be substituted by a scalar in the equation.) It can be seen that the integral of the acceleration function a(t) is the velocity function v(t) ) ; where the area under the acceleration vs. time curve (a vs. t) equals velocity.

Cadmium and its congeners have not always been considered transition metals, as they do not have partially or completely filled d or f electron shells, either in their elemental form or in their common oxidation state. The average concentration of cadmium in the Earth's crust is between 0.1 and 0.5 parts per million (ppm). Cd was discovered in 1817 simultaneously by Stromeyer and Karl Samuel Leberecht Hermann, both in Germany, as an impurity in zinc carbonate. Cadmium occurs as a minor component in most zinc ores and is therefore a by-product of zinc production. Cadmium has long been used as a corrosion-resistant coating on steel, while cadmium compounds are used as red, orange and yellow pigments, to color glass and to stabilize plastics.

Unlike most other metals, cadmium is resistant to corrosion, which is why it is used as a protective coating when deposited on other metals. In bulk metal form, cadmium is insoluble in water and non-flammable; however, in its powdered form, it can burn and release toxic fumes. Although cadmium usually has a +2 oxidation state, it is also present with a +1 oxidation state. Cadmium and its congeners are not always considered transition metals, as they do not have partially or completely filled d or f electron shells, either in their elemental form or in their common oxidation state. Cadmium burns in air to form cadmium oxide (CdO) which is amorphous and brown in color; the crystals that form from this compound are a deep red color that changes color when heated, much like zinc oxide. Hydrochloric, sulfuric and nitric acids dissolve cadmium to form cadmium chloride (CdCl2), cadmium sulfate (CdSO4), or cadmium nitrate (Cd(NO3)2). The +1 oxidation state can be obtained by dissolving cadmium in a mixture of cadmium chloride and aluminum chloride, forming the Cd2+2 cation, much like the Hg2+2 cation in mercury(I) chloride. Most of the structures of cadmium complexes with nucleobases, amino acids and vitamins have been determined. Naturally occurring cadmium consists of 8 isotopes. Two of them are radioactive, and three of them are thought to be decaying but this has not been confirmed experimentally. The two naturally occurring radioactive isotopes are 113Cd (beta decay, with a half-life of 7.7 \u00d7 1015 years) and 116Cd (two double beta decay neutrinos, with a half-life of 2.9 \u00d7 1019 years). The other three are 106Cd, 108Cd (both electron capture doubles), and 114Cd (double beta decay); only a lower limit on their half-lives has been set.",

        "paragraph": "Thermochemistry is a branch of chemistry that studies the energy that accompanies physical changes or chemical reactions. The main goal of thermochemistry is the establishment of criteria for determining the likelihood or spontaneity of the required transformation. In this way, thermochemistry is used to predict the energy changes that occur in chemical reactions, phase changes, and solution formation. Most properties in thermochemistry develop from the application of the I law of thermodynamics, the law of the 'conservation' of energy, to functions of internal energy, enthalpy, entropy and Gibbs free energy. Energy is the ability to do work. Every object has energy. Energy possessed by objects can be divided into kinetic energy and potential energy. Kinetic energy is the energy possessed by moving objects. Examples of energy in the wind, waterfalls, and rotating fans. Potential energy is the energy that an object has due to its state or position. Examples are gravitational potential energy and springs. Heat is energy that is transferred from one object to another due to a temperature difference. The unit for heat is the same as the unit for energy, namely the Joule. Sometimes the units used are calories or kilocalories. The heat of reaction is the heat that accompanies a chemical reaction. The system is everything that is the center of attention. The system is the part whose energy changes are being observed. For example, in observing the process of dissolving table salt in water, table salt and water are a system. The environment is part outside the system. For example, in the process of dissolving table salt, apart from table salt and water, it is the environment, for example the air around it. The system is divided into three, namely: Thermochemical reactions can be divided into exothermic reactions and endothermic reactions.

Enthalpy change is the heat change that occurs in a chemical reaction. \u0394H = HP - HR Note: \u0394H = enthalpy change HP = enthalpy of products HR = enthalpy of reactants The thermochemical equation is a chemical equation that is completed with the price of the enthalpy change. Example of a thermochemical equation: The standard enthalpy of formation is the heat absorbed or released in the formation of one mole of a substance from its elements measured at a temperature of 250C and a pressure of 1 atm. Example: C(S) + O2(g) \u2192 CO2(g) \u2206Hfo = -393.5 kJ. The standard enthalpy of decomposition is the heat absorbed or released in the breakdown of one mole of a substance into its elements. Example: H2O(l) \u2192 H2(g) + 1/2 O2(g) \u2206Hdo = +285.8 kJ.

The middle spectrum, where anthropology and biology converge, is the study of how people actually think about the use and management of plants: ethnomedical, food production and consumption, and ethnoecology. Further into biology, but still taking an anthropological approach, is the field of archeology; archeozoology and archeobotany, which reconstruct past life from biotic data. The study of Ethnobiology received its first official definition from the American ethnobotanist Edward F.

A phonon in physics is a quantum vibrational mode of a rigid crystal lattice, such as a crystal lattice in a solid. Crystals can be formed from solution, vapor, melt or a combination of the three. Crystal formation is strongly influenced by the rate of nucleation and growth.

The gas mixture will contain a variety of pure gases such as air. What distinguishes gases from liquids and solids is the separation of the very large gas particles. This separation usually makes the colorless gas invisible to human observation. The interaction of gas particles in the presence of electric and gravitational fields can be neglected as shown by the constant velocity vector in the figure. One type of gas that is commonly known is steam. Gaseous matter is found between the liquid and plasma states, note 1] the latter provides an upper temperature limit for gases. The lower limit of the temperature scale lies degenerative quantum gases note 2] which are receiving increasing attention. note 3] High density atomic gases that are supercooled at very low temperatures are classified according to their statistical behavior as either Bose gases or Fermi gases.

This is because certain gases depict a supernatural origin, such as from their ability to cause death, extinguish fires, and occur in \"mines, well bottoms, churchyards and other deserted places\". Because most gases are difficult to observe directly, they are described by four physical properties or macroscopic characteristics: pressure, volume, number of particles (chemists classify them by moles) and temperature. These four characteristics have been repeatedly observed by scientists such as Robert Boyle, Jacques Charles, John Dalton, Joseph Gay-Lussac and Amedeo Avogadro for various gases in various situations. Their detailed studies eventually yielded a mathematical relationship between these properties which is expressed by means of the ideal gas law (see simplified models section below). Gas particles are separated far from each other and, as a result, have weaker intermolecular bonds than liquids or solids. These intermolecular forces result from electrostatic interactions between gas particles. The similarly charged gas regions with different gas particles repel each other, while the differently charged regions attract one another; gas containing permanently charged ions is known as plasma. Gaseous compounds with polar covalent bonds contain a permanent charge imbalance and thus experience relatively strong intermolecular forces, even though the net charge of the compound remains neutral. Meanwhile, randomly induced charges are present in non-polar covalently bonded molecules and the electrostatic interactions caused by them are referred to as Van der Waals forces. The interaction of these intermolecular forces varies within the substance which determines many of the physical properties unique to each gas.note 5]note 6] A comparison of the boiling points for compounds formed by ionic and covalent bonds leads us to this conclusion.",

As the wealth brought by the plundering marches and prisoners became more differentiated property, the princes in charge of the army split and began to consolidate power in their hands. The unification of the duchies created by the different white tribes of Lithuania into a single confederation or federal Lithuanian state probably began in the 10th century, but according to the prevailing historiographical concepts, the process of state formation ended only in the 13th century.

Its more important use is as a leather tanner and dye. Gambir also contains catechins (catechin), a natural ingredient that is an antioxidant. India imports 68% gambier from Indonesia, and uses it as a mixture of betel nut. Gambir is also produced from the plant U. acida. Uncaria gambir in the form of a semi-climbing/or climbing herbaceous plant with elongated and horizontal branches; the stem is quadrangular\u2014especially when young\u2014and armed with hook-like curved spines. Single leaves, opposite, slightly leathery, oval to broadly elliptical, (6-)9-12(-15) cm x (3.5-)5-7(-8) cm, rounded or heart-shaped at base, apex tapering , hairless surface (slick), with short petioles. The flowers are compound in a head with a diameter of (3.5-)4\u20135 cm; pink or green crown; short petals, funnel-shaped corolla (like coffee flowers), five stamens. The fruit is a capsule with two chambers, 14\u201318 mm long, has many seeds, wings, and stems up to 20 mm. Gambir has long been cultivated in the Malay Peninsula, Singapore and Indonesia (Sumatra, Java, Bali, Kalimantan and Maluku). Its origin is thought to be from Sumatra and Kalimantan, where wild species are found growing in nature. Rumphius reported that this plant was planted by people in Maluku in the mid-18th century, but other sources believe that its trade in the Malay region has been going on since the 17th century. Wild gambier is often found in secondary forests. It doesn't grow in dry areas, but it can't stand flooding either. Grows well up to a height of 200 m, gambier can live up to an elevation of 1,000 m above sea level. Gambir is also planted in the lowlands.",

Gambir is an extract of hot water from the leaves and twigs of the Gambir plant which is precipitated and then molded and dried, which functions as an astringent. Almost 95% of production is made into this product, which is called betel bite or plan masala. The shape of the mold is usually cylindrical, resembling brown sugar. The color is blackish brown or yellowish. Gambir (known in interstate trade as gambier) is usually shipped in packs of 50 kg. Another form is powder or \"biscuits\".

He is one of the thinkers of anthropocentrism who lived during the Classical Greek period. Socrates' philosophical thought aims to know humans by understanding the universe through theory. The main concern in Socrates' philosophical thought is the nature of human life. He changed the concern of philosophy from natural philosophy to human philosophy. The approach he uses is rationalism. He examines all fields of thought as long as his studies can use reason. Socrates begins every philosophical thought with curiosity. He then made this curiosity the beginning of wisdom. In his time, he became one of the Greek figures who no longer believed in myths. Socrates lived during the development of sophistic thought. His ability to use the dialogue method earned him the sympathy of the youth. Meanwhile, Socrates was despised by followers of the belief in God and God because he was considered corrupting the morals of the youth and rejecting the existence of a god or God that was recognized by his country. Socrates was one of the figures who introduced the term \"philosophy\" in educational institutions. Socrates used a philosophical method known as the midwifery method which became the de facto beginning of the development of the inductive method. Socrates' thoughts influenced his students namely Plato and then to Aristotle who was a student of Plato. The influence of Socrates' thoughts spread from his country, namely Athens, to the Western world. His main thoughts are about moral philosophy or ethics. Socrates was born to a father named Sophroniskos, while his mother was named Phairnarete in 470 BC. His father worked as a sculptor, while his mother was a midwife. Socrates married Xantipe.

Socrates was then executed in 399 BC by drinking poison. The charge laid against him was that he had perverted the minds of the Athenian youths. He died at the age of 70 years. Socrates provides philosophy teaching through the provision of knowledge of something that has been understood by someone. The teaching of Socratic philosophy is referred to as the midwifery method. He likens the process of philosophizing to that of a midwife helping a woman to give birth to her child. In philosophizing, he engages in dialogue. His main concern in philosophy is with what belongs to the human person. Socrates shifted the focus of philosophy from natural philosophy to human philosophy. He uses a critical method in philosophizing, especially regarding ethics. Socrates believes that a lot of knowledge and opinions from humans are pseudo, but humans use them in solving life's problems. He considers that human knowledge about life's problems is unclear and only conjectures. Socrates then examines two knowledges that are a matter of life, namely about happiness and virtue. Socrates begins the study of philosophy with a dialogue that requires agreement on the formulation of the topics being discussed. Submission of descriptions or real examples is carried out in each formulation. After the formulation was set, Socrates held a process of rebuttal which included comparison activities or asking questions. The answers given are in the form of statements that are contradictory or different from the formulations and real examples.

Monarchy is a type of government led by a monarch. Monarchy or royal system of government is the oldest system in the world. At the beginning of the 19th century, there were more than 900 royal thrones in the world, but this decreased to 240 in the 20th century. Whereas in the eighth decade of the 20th century, only 40 thrones remained. Of these, only four countries have an absolute monarchy and the rest have a constitutional monarchy system. The difference between the monarch and the president as the head of state is that the monarch is the head of state for the rest of his life, while the president usually holds this position for a certain period of time. However, in federated countries such as Malaysia, the monarch or Yang diPertuan Agung is only in power for 5 years and will be replaced by monarchs from other countries in the alliance. Nowadays, the concept of absolute monarchy almost no longer exists and most of them are constitutional monarchies, namely monarchs whose powers are limited by the constitution. Democratic monarchy is different from the concept of a real monarchy. At habit monarch would inherit the throne. But in a democratic monarchy system, the throne of the monarch will rotate among several sultans. Malaysia, for example, practices both systems, namely a constitutional monarchy and a democratic monarchy. For most countries, the monarch is a symbol of the country's continuity and sovereignty. In addition, monarchs are usually religious leaders as well as commander-in-chief of a country's armed forces.

In Indonesia, according to RI Law no. 31/2004, as amended by RI Law No. 45/2009, activities included in fisheries start from pre-production, production, processing to marketing, which are carried out in a fishery business system. Thus, fisheries can be considered an agribusiness venture. Generally, fisheries are intended for the benefit of providing food for humans. In addition, other purposes of fishing include sports, recreation (fishing), and perhaps also for the purpose of making jewelry or extracting fish oil. Fishing business is all businesses of individuals or legal entities to catch or cultivate (hatching, breeding, enlargement) fish, including activities to store, cool, dry, or preserve fish with the aim of creating economic added value for business actors (commercial/business). One of the world's oldest trade histories is the trade of dried cod from the Lofoten area to southern Europe, Italy, Spain and Portugal.

It has a very small mass, although recent experiments (see Super-Kamiokande) show that it is not exactly zero. Neutrinos interact only through weak and gravitational interactions, neither through strong interactions nor electromagnetic interactions. A neutrino is a subatomic particle that is very similar to an electron, but has no electrical charge and a very small mass, which might even be zero. Neutrinos are one of the most abundant particles in the universe. Because they have very little interaction with matter, however, they are incredibly difficult to detect. To detect neutrinos, very large and very sensitive detectors are required. Typically, a low-energy neutrino will travel through many light-years of normal matter before interacting with anything. Consequently, all terrestrial neutrino experiments rely on measuring the tiny fraction of neutrinos that interact in reasonably sized detectors. For example, at the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory, a 1000 ton heavy water solar-neutrino detector picks up about 1012 neutrinos every second. About 30 neutrinos per day are detected. Neutrinos are created as a result of certain types of radioactive decay or as a result of nuclear reactions such as those that occur in the Sun, in nuclear reactors, or when cosmic rays strike a group of atoms. There are three types (or \"flavors)\" of neutrinos: electron neutrinos, muon neutrinos, and tauon neutrinos (or tau neutrinos); and each type also has a corresponding antiparticle, called an antineutrino. Electron neutrinos (or antineutrinos) are produced when a proton changes to a neutron (or a neutron to a proton), which are two forms of beta decay.",

Neutrinos were first postulated in December, 1930 by Wolfgang Pauli to describe the energy spectrum of beta decay, the decay of a neutron into a proton and an electron. Pauli theorized that an undetected particle was responsible for the difference between the energy and angular momentum of the particles at the beginning and end of the decay. Due to its \"ghost\" nature, the first experimental detection of neutrinos had to wait 25 years since it was first discussed. In 1956, Clyde Cowan, Frederick Reines, F. B. Harrison, H. W.

The element's name is derived from the Greek \u03c7\u03c1\u1ff6\u03bc\u03b1, chroma, meaning color, because many chromium compounds are very colorful. Ferrochromium alloys are produced commercially from chromite by cilicothermal or aluminothermal reactions and chromium metal by roasting and leaching followed by reduction using carbon and then aluminum. Chromium metal is of high value because of its high resistance to corrosion and hardness. A major development was the discovery that steel could be made highly corrosion and tarnishing resistant by the addition of metallic chromium to form stainless steel. Stainless steel and chrome plating (electroplating with chromium) together account for 85% of commercial use. Trivalent chromium ion (Cr(III)) in trace amounts is an essential nutrient in humans for insulin, sugar and lipid metabolism, although this issue is still being debated. While chromium metal and Cr(III) ions are considered non-toxic, hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) is toxic and carcinogenic. Obsolete chromium production sites often require environmental cleaning. Chromium is amazing for its magnetic properties: it is the only solid element that exhibits a degree of antiferromagnetism at room temperature (and below). Above 38\u00b0C, it becomes paramagnetic.

Passivation can be removed by strong reducing agents which destroy the protective oxide layer on the metal. Chromium metal that has been given this treatment is easily soluble in weak acids. Chromium, unlike similar metals such as iron and nickel, is not affected by hydrogen embrittlement. However it is affected by nitrogen embrittlement, reacting with nitrogen from water and forming brittle nitrides at high temperatures which are part of metal works. Chromium is the 22nd most abundant element in the Earth's crust with an average concentration of 100 ppm. Chromium compounds are found in the environment from erosion of chromium-containing rocks, and can be disseminated by volcanic eruptions. Typical background chromium concentrations in environmental media are: atmosphere <10 ng\u02d1m\u22123; soil <500 mg\u02d1kg\u22121; vegetation <0.5\u00a0mg\u02d1kg\u22121; fresh water <10 ug\u02d1L\u22121; seawater <1\u00a0ug\u02d1L\u22121; sediment <80\u00a0mg\u02d1kg\u22121.

        "paragraph": "Lead or lead (also known as lead or lead)a] is a chemical element with the symbol Pb and atomic number 82. This element is a heavy metal with a higher density than many materials found in everyday life. Lead is malleable, malleable, and has a low melting point. When freshly cut, lead has a silvery bluish glow, but when exposed to air it turns an opaque gray color to the surface. Lead is the stable element with the highest atomic number and three of its isotopes are the end products of the chain decay of heavier elements. Lead is a metal of group IVA (14) which is relatively inert or does not react easily. This metal is amphoteric; Elemental lead and its oxide compounds easily react with acids and bases. In compounds, lead usually has an oxidation number of +2, and is rarely oxidized to the +4 which is common in the above group IVA elements. However, the oxidation number +4 occurs frequently in organolead compounds. Lead can be mined from certain mineral ores; this was practiced since prehistoric times in Asia Minor. Galena, the principal ore of lead, often contains silver, so it was extensively mined and used in Ancient Rome. However, production has declined since the fall of Rome, and it was not until the Industrial Revolution that lead production again reached Roman levels. In 2014, world lead production exceeded 10 million tonnes per year, and more than half of it was recycled. Useful properties of lead include high density, low melting point, malleability, and corrosion resistance. In addition, this metal is relatively cheap and has many sources, so it is often used by humans, including for buildings, water pipes, batteries, bullets, ballast, solder, paint, fuel additives, and radiation shields.",

        "paragraph": "However, since the 19th century, the toxic properties of lead were discovered and its use was reduced. Lead can enter the human body through food, drink, and polluted air or dust. This element damages the nervous system and interferes with the function of enzymes in the body. Lead is especially dangerous for children because it can interfere with brain growth. The lead atom has 82 electrons, with the configuration Xe]4f145d106s26p2. The sum of lead's first and second ionization energies (energy to remove its two outer electrons) is similar to that of tin (Sn), lead's top neighbor in group IVA. This is unreasonable because an element's ionization energy is usually lower than that of its upper neighbors in the same group, because its outer electrons are farther from the atomic nucleus and are separated by a greater number of lower-level orbitals. This abnormality is caused by a phenomenon called lanthanide contraction, namely the reduction in atomic radii from lanthanum (atomic number 57) to lutetium (71), and the relatively small atomic radii of the following elements. This is a result of the ineffectiveness of the 4f electrons in shielding the outer electrons from the pull of the atomic nucleus. Even when the first through fourth ionization energies are added up, the total ionization energy of lead exceeds that of tin, reversing the pattern that is common for the top-down neighbors of the periodic table. Among the causes of this anomaly are relativistic quantum chemical effects. One of them is the oblique pair effect, which causes the two 6s electrons of lead to tend not to be involved in the bond, so that the distance between the atoms in the lead crystal becomes very far. The elements above lead in group IVA (carbon, silicon, germanium, and tin) have an allotrope with a cubic structure like diamond, that is, with covalent bonds in a tetrahedral arrangement. In these elements, the energy levels of the outermost s and p orbitals are so similar that they can hybridize to form sp3 orbitals.",

A nation is also defined as a political-cultural community that is aware of autonomy, unity and common interests. In international law, nation is the term for a sovereign state. American Political Researcher Ben Anderson characterizes the nation as an \"imagined Community\", and Australian Academic Paul James (academician) sees it as an \"Abstract Community\". The nation is an Envisioned Community in the sense that the material conditions exist to broaden images and relations together and are objectively impersonal, even if each individual in that country experiences themselves as a subjective part of a part of oneness with others. For the most part, the members of a nation remain strangers to one another and may never meet. Hence the phrase, \"a nation of strangers\" is used by writers such as the American journalist Vance Packard. So the nation is the reality of intersubjectivity and exists solely in the minds of the people's shadows. Even if someone finally believes that the nation does not exist, the nation will still not be threatened, because the nation is not a reality of subjectivism that exists in one person's mind.

Pluto has an eccentric, tilted orbit at a distance of 30 to 49 astronomical units (4.4\u20137.3 billion km) from the Sun. This means that there are times when Pluto is closer to the Sun than Neptune; stable orbital resonance with Neptune keeps the two planets from colliding. In 2014, Pluto was 32.6 AU from the Sun. Sunlight takes 5.5 hours to reach Pluto at its average distance (39.4 s). Pluto was discovered in 1930 and originally stated to be the ninth planet from the Sun. After 1992, its planetary status was called into question after astronomers discovered the Kuiper belt, the circle of objects beyond Neptune that includes Pluto and other objects. In 2005, Eris, which is 27% more massive than Pluto, was discovered. The International Astronomical Union (IAU) issued its first official definition of \"planet\" in 2006.

The term \"borate\" can also refer to the tetrahedral boron anion, or a looser description of chemical compounds containing a borate anion. The larger borates consist of flat trigonal BO3 or tetrahedral BO4 structural units, joined together via a shared oxygen atom and may be cyclic or linear in structure. Boron most often occurs in nature as borates, such as borate and borosilicate minerals. The simple borate anion, the orthoborate ion, BO33\u2212 is known in the solid state, for example in Ca3(BO3)2. In this case, the borates adopt a near flat trigonal structure. This compound is a structural analogue of the carbonate anion CO32\u2212, with which it is isoelectronic. The simple bond theory points to a flat trigonal structure. In terms of valence bond theory, the bonds are formed by using sp2 hybrid orbitals on boron. Some compounds called orthoborates do not always contain a flat trigonal ion, for example gadolinium orthoborate, GdBO3 contains the polyborate ion (B3O9)9\u2212, while the high temperature form contains a flat BO33\u2212. All borates can be considered as derivatives of boric acid, B(OH)3. Boric acid is a weak acidic proton donor due to its reaction with water, forming tetrahydroxyborate, releasing a proton: In the presence of cis-diols such as mannitol, glucose, sorbitol, and glycerol the pK drops to about 4. Under acidic conditions, boric acid undergoes a condensation reaction to form forms polymeric oxyanions: The tetraborate anion (tetramer) includes two tetrahedral and two trigonally symmetrical boron atoms assembled in a cyclic structure. The two tetrahedral boron atoms are linked together by a common oxygen atom and each also carries a negative charge carried by the additional OH- lateral groups that accompany it.

Sodium borate can be obtained at high purification and can be used to prepare standard solutions in titrimetric analysis. A number of metal borates are known. The metal is produced by treating boric acid or boron oxide with metal oxides. Further examples include linear chains of 2, 3, or 4 trigonal BO3 structural units, each sharing one oxygen atom with adjacent units: Metaborates, such as LiBO2 contain chains of trigonal BO3 structural units, each sharing two oxygen atoms with adjacent units. , while NaBO2 and KBO2 contain cyclic B3O62\u2212 ions. Borosilicate glass, also known as pyrex, can be seen as a silicate in which some SiO44\u2212 units are replaced by BO45\u2212 centers, together with cations to compensate for differences in the Si(IV) and B(III) valence states. Because these substitutions cause imperfections, the material is slow to crystallize and forms a glass with a low coefficient of thermal expansion and resistant to cracking when heated, such as soda glass. Common borate salts include sodium metaborate, NaBO2, and borax. Borax dissolves in water, so mineral deposits are found only in places with very low rainfall. Extensive deposits were discovered in Death Valley and transported by the famous team of twenty mules (1883-1889). Later (1925), deposits were discovered in Boron, California on the edge of the Mojave Desert. The Atacama Desert in Chile also contains concentrations of mineable borates. Lithium metaborate or lithium tetraborate, or a mixture of the two, can be used in the sample preparation of smelting borates of various samples for analysis by XRF, AAS, ICP-OES, ICP-AES and ICP-MS.

In addition, the government he founded had a centralized structure similar to the command structure of Napoleon's troops. He also divided Java into nine administrative regions, each consisting of districts under the control of a regent. Ong Hok Ham commented on Daendels' militaristic style of government: \"Glorious the militarization of the colonial government by giving all officials, both European and Javanese, a military rank. Perhaps he hoped that this would lead to greater discipline!\" Since then, a tradition has begun among Dutch colonial administrative officials, who were known post-1816 as Pangreh Praja (Binnenlands Bestuur) and that post-Java War prijajis wore military-style uniforms as a sign of civil servant status.

In addition to carrying out government reforms with a militaristic style of government, Daendels was also the originator of the construction of Jalan Raya Pos which stretches from west to east of Java Island.

In the 16th century, the Mughal Empire ruled Bengal and Dhaka became an important provincial center of the Mughal government. European traders arrived in the 15th century, and their influence grew until the British East India Company took control of Bengal after the Battle of Plassey in 1757. The bloody rebellion of 1857 \u2013 known as the Sepoy Mutiny \u2013 resulted in the transfer of power to the royal crown with a viceroy as administrator. During the colonial period, famine hit the Indian subcontinent many times, such as the famine in Bengal in 1943 which killed 3 million people. Between 1905 and 1911, an attempt was made to separate the province of Bengal into two zones, with Dhaka as the capital of the eastern zone. When India was divided in 1947, Bengal was divided along religious lines. The western part of Bengal belonged to India, and the eastern part joined Pakistan as a province called East Bengal (later to become East Pakistan). In 1950, land reform was carried out in East Bengal with the abolition of the feudal zamindar system.",

Uranus is the planet with the third largest radius and fourth largest mass in the Solar System. Uranus is also the only planet named after a character in Greek mythology, the Latinized version of the name of the Greek sky god Ouranos. Uranus is similar in composition to Neptune, and both have different chemical compositions from the larger gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. Because of this, astronomers often place Uranus and Neptune in the category of \"ice giants\" to distinguish them from the gas giants. Uranus's atmosphere is similar to Jupiter's and Saturn's in that it is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, but contains more \"ice\" elements such as water, ammonia and methane, along with traces of hydrocarbons. Uranus's atmosphere is the atmosphere of the coldest planet in the Solar System, with a minimum temperature of 49 K (\u2212224 \u00b0C; \u2212371 \u00b0F). Uranus's atmosphere has a layered and complex cloud structure, and it is estimated that the lowest cloud layer consists of water and the highest cloud layer consists of methane. The interior of Uranus is mostly composed of ice and rock. Like the other giant planets, Uranus has a ring system, a magnetosphere, and numerous moons. The Uranus system has a unique configuration among the planets because its axial tilt is tilted sideways, nearly into the plane of its revolution about the Sun. Therefore, its north and south poles are located where other planets are equator.

The main divisions of the company are Industry, Energy, Health Care (Siemens Healthineers), and Infrastructure & Cities. The company is a leading manufacturer of medical diagnostic equipment, and its healthcare division, which accounts for approximately 12% of its total sales, is the second most profitable business unit, after its industrial automation division. The company is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index. Siemens and its subsidiaries employ around 385,000 people worldwide and generated revenues of around \u20ac87 billion in 2019. Siemens & Halske was founded by Werner von Siemens and Johann Georg Halske on October 1, 1847. Based on the telegraph, their invention used a needle to designate a sequence of letters instead of using Morse code. The company, which was later named Telegraphen-Buanstalt von Siemens & Halske, opened its first workshop on October 12, 1847. In 1848, Siemens & Halske built the first long-distance telegraph line in Europe, which was 500 km from Berlin to Frankfurt am Main. In 1850, Werner von Siemens' younger brother, Carl Wilhelm Siemens, later Sir William Siemens, began representing Siemens & Halske in London. The agency in London became a branch office in 1858. In the 1850s, Siemens & Halske was involved in building long-distance telegraph networks in Russia.

        "paragraph": "Epidemiology is a branch of biology that studies and analyzes the distribution, patterns, and determinants of health and disease conditions in certain populations. Epidemiology is a cornerstone of public health, which shapes decision-making in public policy and evidence-based practice by identifying risk factors for disease and identifying disease prevention goals. Epidemiologists assist with study design, collection and statistical analysis of data, making interpretations, and disseminating findings (including occasional peer reviews and systematic reviews). Epidemiology has helped develop methodologies used in clinical research, public health research, and, to a lesser extent, basic research in biology. The main areas of epidemiological study include disease causation, disease transmission, outbreak investigation, disease surveillance, environmental epidemiology, forensic epidemiology, occupational epidemiology, screening, biological monitoring, and comparison of treatment effects as in clinical trials. Epidemiologists rely on other disciplines such as biology to better understand disease processes, statistics to utilize data efficiently and draw appropriate conclusions, social sciences to better understand proximate and proximate causes, and engineering for exposure assessment. Epidemiology, literally \"the study of what is in people\", comes from the Greek epi, meaning 'amongst', and demos, meaning 'people, district', and logos, meaning 'study, word , discourse', thus showing that epidemiology only applies to human populations. However, the term is widely used in the study of animal populations (veterinary epidemiology), despite the availability of the term \"epizoology\", and has also been applied to the study of plant populations (plant disease epidemiology). The distinction between \"epidemic\" and \"endemic\" was first expressed by Hippocrates, to distinguish between diseases that \"visit\" a population (epidemic) and diseases that \"live in\" a population (endemic).",

Indonesian tobacco is an absorption of the word \"tabaco\" from Spanish which is considered as the origin of the word. The largest production of tobacco comes from the species Nicotiana tabacum, although Nicotiana rustica is also used in some places. Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan was the first to distinguish between the two species in the Florentine Codex written between 1540 and 1585. Tobacco is an annual agricultural product that is not a food commodity, but a plantation commodity. This product is consumed not for food but as a spare time filler or \"entertainment\", namely as a raw material for cigarettes and cigars. Tobacco can also be chewed. The rich content of secondary metabolites also makes it useful as a pesticide and medicinal raw material. Tobacco has long been used as an entheogen in America. The arrival of Europeans to North America popularized the tobacco trade, especially as a sedative. This popularity led to the economic growth of the southern United States. After the United States Civil War, changes in demand and labor led to the development of the tobacco industry. This new product quickly burgeoned with the tobacco companies until a scientific controversy occurred in the mid-20th century. The word tobacco comes from the Spanish word \"tabaco\". However, the origin of the word \"tabaco\" is still a matter of debate among etnomologists. This word is thought to be an absorption word in the Guarani language, which refers to the tube used to suck the tobacco powder used by the Haitian Indians and is made from tapir bone. This opinion is in accordance with the statement of Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo y Vald\u00e9s who said that \"tabaco\" is a kind of Y-shaped pipe for inhaling tobacco smoke, while the tobacco leaves used are referred to as cohiba.",

The tobacco plant is an annual plant, although Nicotiana var fruticosa is an annual plant. The height of the tobacco varies depending on the species and where it is grown with the tallest varieties reaching 12 feet. This plant takes 40 to 60 days to germinate before grafting when it is 15 cm high. Tobacco is able to grow in a wide range of climates with a growing time of 60 to 90 days with frost-free conditions from grafting to harvest with temperatures of 20\u00b0C to 30\u00b0C . The dry season is the time to harvest and ripen the leaves so that the leaves are in good quality. Because when it rains excessively, the leaves that are harvested will have a thin and light leaf shape. Tobacco stalks vary in size depending on the variety. Most varieties have a rough, uneven surface, while other species have a smooth surface. Tobacco stalks are characterized by being erect, round, sticky, hairy, sticky and large in size. The stalks are composed of a wood-like substance and contain a sticky pith. Tobacco has various leaf shapes, such as oval, lanceolate and pointed.

There are fundamental aspects to emotion to consider, including: All emotions originate in the limbic system of the brain which is about the size of a walnut and located in the brainstem People tend to feel happy when their limbic system is relatively inactive. People's limbic systems are not the same. The limbic system is more active in depressed people, especially when they receive negative information. Everyone responds differently to stimuli that trigger the same emotions. In some cases, personality is the cause of these emotional differences. At other times, the differences arise as a result of job requirements. The success of meeting an employee's emotional demands of a job depends not only on the emotions that must be displayed and their intensity but also on how often and how long they try to display them. Emotions are important to rational thinking because they provide important information about understanding the world around us. In an organization, the key to making good decisions is to apply thoughts and feelings in a decision.",

Emotions greatly influence human behavior. another human. One way of classifying emotions is based on whether they are positive or negative. Positive emotions - such as joy and gratitude - express an evaluation or feeling of benefit, whereas negative emotions - such as anger or guilt - express the opposite. Emotions cannot be neutral, because to be neutral is to be nonemotional. Personality predisposes people to experience certain moods and emotions, for example some people feel guilty and experience anger more easily than others, whereas others may feel calm and relaxed in any situation. In essence, some people have a tendency to experience any emotion more intensely or to have a high affect intensity (individual differences in the strength with which individuals experience their emotion).

Dubai is one of the most popular tourism destinations in the world. The city has the second most five-star hotels in the world and also the tallest building in the world, Burj Khalifa. Written documents state the existence of this city for 150 years before the formation of the UAE. Dubai shares legal, political, military and economic powers with the other emirates within the federal sphere, although each emirate has jurisdiction over some powers such as civil law enforcement and monitoring and updating of local facilities. Dubai has the largest population and is the second largest emirate by area, after Abu Dhabi. Dubai and Abu Dhabi are the only two emirates with veto power over critical matters of national interest within the country's Federal National Council. Dubai has been ruled by the Al Maktoum dynasty since 1833. Its current leader, Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, also serves as Prime Minister and Vice President of the UAE. The emirate's income comes from trade, real estate and financial services. Revenue from oil and natural gas accounts for less than 6% (2006) of Dubai's US$37 billion (2005) economy. Real estate and construction contributed 22.6% to the economy in 2005, before the large-scale construction season that has lasted until now. Dubai has attracted worldwide attention through its innovative real estate projects and sporting events.

According to Fedel Handhal, a researcher on UAE history and culture, the word Dubai may come from the word Daba (a derivative of Yadub), which means to spread; this word could be a reference to the flow of Dubai Creek inland. Very little is known about the pre-Islamic culture of the southeastern Arabian peninsula, except for the many ancient cities in the region which were centers of trade between the Eastern and Western worlds. The remnants of an ancient mangrove swamp, dated at 7,000 years, were discovered during the construction of sewer lines near Dubai Internet City. This area was covered with sand about 5,000 years ago after the coastline retreated inland, becoming part of the city's present coastline. Before Islam, people in this region worshiped Bajir (or Bajar). The Byzantine and Sassanid empires were dominant at this time, with the Sassanids controlling most of the territory. After the spread of Islam there, the Umayyad Caliph, from the eastern Islamic world, expanded into southeastern Arabia and defeated the Sassanids. Excavations undertaken by the Dubai Museum in the Al-Jumayra (Jumeirah) area confirmed the presence of several artifacts from the Umayyad period.

In order for an organism to become a fossil, the remains of this organism must soon be buried in sediment. Paleontologists classify fossils into several types. Animals or plants that are thought to be extinct but in fact still exist are called living fossils. The most common fossils are skeletal remains such as shells, teeth and bones. Soft tissue fossils are very rare. The science that studies fossils is paleontology, which is also a branch of science embraced by archeology. Fossilization is the process of hoarding the remains of animals or plants that accumulate in sediments or deposits that are either completely preserved, partially or only in traces. There are several conditions for fossilization to occur, including: The term \"living fossil\" is a term used for a living species that resembles a species known only from fossils. Some of the living fossils include coelacanth fish and ginkgo trees. A living fossil can also refer to a living species that has no other close species or a small group of close species that does not have any other close species. An example of this last criterion is nautilus. Most fossils are found in open-surface sedimentary rocks. Rocks that contain many fossils are called fossiliferous. The types of fossils contained in rocks depend on the type of environment in which the sediments were scientifically deposited. Marine sediments, from coastlines and shallow seas, usually contain the most fossils. Fossils are formed from the process of destroying remains of organisms that once lived.

Tissue is a collection of similar cells and their extracellular matrix that together carry out certain functions. At the next level, a number of different tissues can work together to form organs. The branch of biology that studies tissue is histology, while the branch of biology that studies changes in tissue shape and function in relation to disease is histopathology. The classic tool used to study tissue is the paraffin block, to which the tissue is attached, cut, stained, then examined under a microscope. Technological developments such as the use of electron microscopy and immunofluorescence have made it possible to observe more and more detailed tissues. Tissues are owned by organisms that already have a division of tasks for each group of cells. Thallus organisms, such as algae (\"algae\") and fungi (\"mushrooms\"), do not have differentiated tissues, although they can form characteristic organ-like structures, such as fruiting bodies and sporophores. Moss plants can be said to have a clear network, even though it does not yet have a clear vascular network. In animals, tissues are grouped into four basic types, namely epithelial tissue, connective tissue, muscle tissue, and nervous tissue. Although all animals are generally considered to contain all four of these tissue types, their manifestations may differ depending on the type of organism. Differences during the developmental period of an organism raises differences in the origin of its cells and tissues. The epithelium in all animals is derived from the ectoderm and endoderm layers, and a small part of the mesoderm, which forms the endothelium, a special type of epithelium that forms blood vessels. In contrast, true epithelial tissue is present in only a single layer of cells held together by a junction, called a tight junction, to create a selectively permeable barrier.

The cells that make up the lining of the epithelium are connected by tight junctions that are semipermeable; hence, this tissue acts as a barrier between the external environment and the organs it encloses. In addition to this protective function, epithelial tissue can also be specialized for functions in secretion, excretion, and absorption. Epithelial tissue helps protect organs from microorganisms, injury, and fluid loss. Epithelial tissue consists of three kinds, namely exothelium which covers the outside of the body, endothelium which lines the internal organs of the body, and mesothelium which lines the body cavities. There are various functions of epithelial tissue: There are many types of epithelium and their names vary quite a bit. Generally, classification schemes combine descriptions of cell shape with words indicating the number of layers: simple (one cell layer) or stratified (multiple cell layers). However, other cellular characteristics such as cilia can also be described in a classification system. Common types of epithelium include simple squamous epithelium, stratified squamous epithelium, simple cuboidal epithelium, transitional epithelium, pseudo columnar epithelium (also known as ciliated columnar epithelium, columnar epithelium, and glandular epithelium.

        "paragraph": "Hydrolysis is the decomposition of substances in a chemical reaction caused by water. The chemical reaction in hydrolysis breaks down water molecules (H2O) into hydrogen cations (H+) and hydroxide anions (OH\u2212). Hydrolysis depends on the chemistry, solubility, degree of acidity and oxidation-reduction of each compound. Chemically and physiologically, hydrolysis is a double decomposition reaction with water as the reactant, so when a compound is represented by AB (for example) where A and B are groups and HOH is water, the reaction is reversible as follows AB\u21bd\u2212\u2212\u21c0HOH{\\displaystyle {\\ce {AB <=> HOH}}} . In addition to water as a reactant and product of hydrolysis, neutral molecules can involve organic compounds or ionic molecules such as the hydrolysis of salts, acids and bases. Hydrolysis can be applied to complex lipids such as phospholipids and glycolipids. On the other hand, hydrolysis cannot be applied to simple lipids such as fats, oils and waxes. The word \"hydrolysis\" comes from the Greek hydro \"water\" + lysis \"separation\". When in aqueous solution it decomposes into hydrogen cations (H+) and hydroxide anions (OH\u2212) which will then react with other compound ions which causes leftover or excess hydrogen cations (H+) and hydroxide anions (OH\u2212) so that the solution is acidic or basic. If water ions do not react with compounds in certain solutions, the solution remains neutral (still the pH of water). This process is usually used to break down certain polymers, especially those prepared by step-growth polymerization. Simply put, hydrolysis is the breaking down of chemical bonds with the help of water, for example sucrose saccharification. Saccharification is carbohydrates that are broken down into simpler sugars by hydrolysis. Hydrolysis is different from hydration. On hydration, the molecule does not split into two new compounds. Usually hydrolysis occurs during the digestion of carbohydrates.",

        "paragraph": "It can be said that hydration occurs when water molecules surround the ion in a certain state. Usually hydrolysis is a chemical process that is the addition of one molecule of water to a chemical substance. Sometimes these additions cause the chemicals and water molecules to separate into two parts. In such a reaction, a fraction of the target molecule (or parent molecule) gains a hydrogen ion. In general, there are 3 types of hydrolysis namely acid hydrolysis, salt hydrolysis and base hydrolysis. Water can act as either an acid or a base, according to the Bronsted-Lowry acid-base theory. In this case, the water molecule will release a proton. Acid hydrolysis in chemistry, is defined as a process in which prostatic acid is used to catalyze chemical bonds through nucleophilic substitution reactions, with the addition of water. Hydrolysis usually occurs when a salt of a weak acid or weak acid (or both) is dissolved in water. Water will spontaneously ionize into hydronium cations (H3O+ or commonly known as H+) and hydroxide anions (OH- single bonds). For example salt using sodium acetate then dissociates into constituent cations (Na+) and anions (CH3COO-). Sodium ions tend to remain ionic (Na+) and slightly react with hydroxide ions (OH-) while acetate ions combine with hydronium ions to produce acetic acid (CH3COOH). The net result is a relative excess of hydroxide ions and the nature of the solution to become alkaline. In addition, it is known that strong acids can also undergo hydrolysis, when sulfuric acid is dissolved in water, and the solvent is accompanied by hydrolysis to produce hydronium ions and bisulfate ions. Most of the acid hydrolysis is carried out using concentrated sulfuric acid, as for other mineral acids such as phosphoric or nitric acids. so acid-base hydrolysis is very important in life. Basically, pure water has a weak electrolyte, weak due to the lack of dissociation of hydrogen and hydroxide, but there is a balance with these two ions.",

This includes the study of signs and sign processes (semiosis), indications, designation, likeness, analogy, metaphor, symbolism, meaning, and communication. Semiotics is closely related to the field of linguistics, which, in part, studies the more specific structure and meaning of language. However, different from linguistics, semiotics also studies non-linguistic sign systems. Semiotics is divided into three branches, namely: Semiotics is often seen as having an important anthropological dimension; for example, Umberto Eco proposed that every cultural phenomenon can be studied as communication. However, some semioticians focus on the logical dimension of knowledge. They also examine areas for the life sciences \u2013 such as how organisms make predictions about, and adapt, semiotics to their niches in the world (see semiosis). In general, semiotic theories take signs or sign systems as their object of study: the communication of information in living organisms is included in biosemiotics (including zoosemiotics). Syntax is a branch of semiotics that deals with the formal properties of signs and symbols. More precisely, Syntax deals with \"the rules that govern how words are combined to form phrases and sentences\". Charles Morris added that semantics is concerned with the relation of signs to their designata and the objects that enable or indicate; and, pragmatics deals with the biotic aspect of semiosis, that is, with all the psychological, biological, and sociological phenomena that occur in the functioning of signs.

There are two figures that need to be known when discussing signs in a semiotic perspective, namely Ferdinand de Saussure and Charles Sanders Pierce. Both laid the basic ideas that became the basis for the development of semiotics. For Saussure, semiotics (semiology) is the general science of signs, a science that examines the life of signs in a society. Pierce himself argues that semiotics is another form of logic, namely the formal doctrine of signs. Thus, semiotics for Saussure is part of the discipline of social psychology, while semiotics for Pierce is a branch of philosophy. In subsequent developments, semiotics was influenced by structuralism and poststructuralism through figures such as Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss, Louis Althusser, Jacques Lacan, Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida, Julia Kristeva, Gilles Deleuze, F\u00e9lix Guattari, Umberto Eco, and Zlavoj Zizek. Semiotics is a rapidly growing object of study. While studying a form of semiotics, a new form of semiotics has emerged. This makes defining it precisely difficult. Here are three general definitions that were successfully defined by Eugene Gorny to explain it. The first definition that is often used is the science of signs or sign systems. This definition then raises the question \"who can determine the difference between a sign and not a sign?\" Before semiotics came into being, Augustine of Hippo was aware of the difficulty of distinguishing \"things\" from signs. Someone is able to know something and talk about \"something\" with the help of signs. Humans replace \"something\" with a sign adapted to \"something\". This is the idea of \u200b\u200bthe father of modern semiotics, Charles Sanders Pierce, who tries to return all \"things\" to \"something in itself\", as well as the step of carrying out sign studies in efforts to understand the human mind and its world.",

        "paragraph": "Intuition is the term for the ability to understand something without going through reasoning and intellect. The word intuition comes from the Latin verb \"intueri\" which is translated as \"to consider\" or from the English, \"intuit\" which is \"to ponder\". This intuitive understanding comes instantly from another world and beyond human self-consciousness. For example, someone suddenly compelled to read a book. Apparently, in the book found the information he was looking for years. Or for example, feeling that he has to go somewhere, it turns out that there he found a big discovery that changed his life. But not all intuition comes from psychic powers. Some intuition can be used as a basis for thinking to get objective truth. One study showed that people who were in the top ranks of business or executives scored better in sixth sense test experiments than the average person. The research seems to confirm that successful people apply more psychic powers in their daily lives, which can support their success. One form of psychic ability that often appears is the ability of intuition. Not infrequently, intuition determines the decisions they make. However, many people think intuition is often considered irrational and unjustified as the main method of decision making. In fact, intuition can be true because it is the result of filtered knowledge and experience to be used as a reference for decision making. For example, some scientists claim that mathematical truth can only be obtained through intuition. Thus, now many people believe that good and sharp intuition is a requirement for someone to be successful in life. It is therefore not surprising that many books on successful tips always include sharpening intuition strategies.",

Other fields use the word \"intuition\" in very different ways, but are not limited to direct access to unconscious knowledge; subconscious cognition; inner sensing; inner insight into subconscious pattern recognition; and the ability to understand something instinctively without the need for conscious reasoning. According to Sigmund Freud, knowledge can only be achieved through the intellectual manipulation of observations that are carried out seriously and reject ways of acquiring knowledge, such as using intuition. Thus, knowledge cannot be achieved only through intuition, but must be based on rational thinking and a scientific attitude. In the Ego Theory expressed by Carl Jung, it is defined that intuition is an 'irrational function' and perceptions obtained through the unconscious. Such as using sensory perception only as a starting point for discovering ideas, images, possibilities, and ways out of difficult situations through processes that are largely unconscious. Jung classifies several types of human psychology which are written in his book. Jung further explained that someone who predominantly uses his intuition, the \"intuitive type\", will act not on the basis of rational thinking but only on mere perception. Extroverted intuitive types, oriented to new possibilities that are promising even if they have not been proven true, they tend to pursue new possibilities before old efforts bear fruit, so they often make changes constantly. The introverted intuitive type is oriented towards images from the subconscious, always exploring the psychic world of archetypes, trying to understand the meaning of events, but often not interested in playing a role in these events and does not see any connection between the psychic world and himself. Jung thought that the intuitive, extroverted type was most likely to be a businessman, a speculator, or a cultural revolutionary.",

Depending on the point of view and approach of a researcher, linguistics is often classified into cognitive science, psychology and anthropology. There are three broad aspects of research, which include language form, language meaning, and language in context. The earliest known activity in language descriptions has been attributed to P\u0101\u1e47ini around 500 BC with his analysis of Sanskrit in Ashtadhyayi. Language can be understood as an interaction of sound and meaning. The discipline that studies the sounds of language is called phonetics, which is concerned with the actual and non-sounding properties of speech sounds and how they are produced and perceived. The study of language meaning, on the other hand, is concerned with how language uses logic and real-world references to convey, process, and assign meaning and to manage and resolve ambiguity. This in turn includes the study of semantics (meanings inferred from words and concepts) and pragmatics (meanings inferred from context). There is a system of rules (known as grammar) that govern communication between members of a given speech community. Grammar is influenced by sound and meaning, including morphology (the formation and composition of words), syntax (the formation and composition of phrases and sentences from these words), and phonology (sound system). Through corpus linguistics, large chunks of text can be analyzed for the possible occurrence of particular linguistic forms and stylistic patterns in written or spoken discourse. Linguistics develops in harmony with the complexity of the object or material being studied.",

The branches of linguistics include the following: Linguistics has several aspects including phonological aspects, morphological aspects, syntactic aspects, semantic aspects, and pragmatic aspects. The basic tenet of humanistic linguistics is that language is an invention created by humans. A semiotic tradition of linguistic research considers language as a sign system that arises from the interaction of meaning and form. The organization of language structure is considered computational. Linguistics is basically seen as related to the social sciences and culture because different languages \u200b\u200bare formed in social interactions by speech communities. Frameworks representing the humanistic view of language include structural linguistics, among others. Structural analysis means dissecting every layer: phonetic, morphological, syntax, and discourse, down to the smallest units. These are aggregated into an inventory (e.g. phonemes, morphemes, lexical classes, types of phrases) to study their relatedness in structural hierarchies and layers. Functional analysis adds to the structural analysis of the assignment of semantic roles and other functional roles that each unit may have. For example, a noun phrase can function as the grammatical subject or object of a sentence, or as a semantic agent or patient. Functional linguistics, or functional grammar, is a branch of structural linguistics. In a humanistic context, the terms structuralism and functionalism are related to their meanings in other human sciences. The difference between formal and functional structuralism lies in their answer to the question why language has the properties it has. Functional explanation entails the notion that language is a tool for communication, or that communication is the primary function of language.",

Viewed from the perspective of the history of philosophy, Plato is classified as an Ancient Greek philosopher. He is the author of philosophical dialogues and the founder of the Platonic Academy in Athens, the first high school in the western world. Plato is believed to be a philosopher who played a major role in the development of Ancient Greek philosophy and western philosophy in general. Plato's teacher, Socrates, and Plato's student, Aristotle, also made a great contribution. Apart from being a philosopher, Plato is also known as one of the founders of western religions and spirituality. Plato's thought was developed into Neoplatonism by thinkers such as Plotinus and Porphyry. Neoplantonism had a major influence on the development of Christianity, especially influencing the thinking of Church Fathers such as Augustine. The philosopher Alfred North Whitehead even credited Plato with saying, \"The safest general characterization of the European philosophical tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to Plato\". Plato's thinking was heavily influenced by Socrates. His most famous work is The Republic (in Greek \u03a0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 or Politeia, \"country\") in which he outlines his views on the \"ideal\" state. . citation needed] One of Plato's famous parables is the parable of the man in the cave.

Modern people think that ideas are ideas or responses that exist in thought alone. Reference needed] According to Plato, ideas are not created by human thought. Idea is a world that transcends humans, so ideas do not depend on human thinking, but the human mind depends on the world of ideas. Ideas are the principal and prime images of reality, immaterial, eternal and unchanging. Ideas already exist and stand alone outside of our thinking. These ideas are related to one another. For example, the idea of \u200b\u200btwo paintings cannot be separated from the second idea, the second idea itself cannot be separated from the even idea. However, in the end there is a peak between the highest relation of ideas. This peak is called a \"beautiful\" idea. This idea goes beyond all existing ideas.

The formation of ethics through a process of philosophy so that ethics is part of philosophy. The main element that makes up ethics is morals. Ethics only regulates the way humans act and does not pay attention to the physical condition of humans. The scope of ethics includes the analysis and application of the concepts of right, wrong, good, bad and responsibility. The general grouping of ethics consists of descriptive ethics, normative ethics, deontological ethics, and teleological ethics. The benefit of ethics is the existence of individual self-control. which can facilitate the fulfillment of the interests of social groups. The word 'ethics' comes from the ancient Greek word ethos. In general, it means habit or good will that is permanent. Meanwhile, in the singular form, this word also has several meanings related to places or thoughts. Its meaning as a place is an ordinary place to live, a meadow, or a stable. While its meaning as a thought is habit, custom, morals, character, attitude or way of thinking. In philosophy, the meaning of ethics used is as a way of thinking. This term was used in philosophy for the first time by Aristotle (384\u2013322 BC) to describe moral philosophy. In this sense, ethics is defined as the science of customs and habits. Ethics is a scientific discipline that aims to study morals. Apart from ethics, there are several other scientific disciplines that study morals, including anthropology, sociology, and psychology.

This tradition takes the form of a statement that mathematical principles are the basis of all reality. These students believe in reincarnation where the human body acts as a tomb for the soul. The soul can only be freed from sensual attraction by doing cleansing. This form of soul cleansing is spiritual work and asceticism. This form of asceticism is primarily through philosophical and mathematical thought. Aristotle then explained the notion of ethics as a science that studies human actions. Its scope only includes procedures or habits that result in actions that are considered good or bad according to human nature. The term \"ethics\" has similarities and differences with several other terms, namely \"ethics\" and \"etiquette\". The similarities between the three are in terms of form and elements. Ethics is the study of ethics. While etiquette is customs, manners, and behavior in positive human relations. The similarities between ethics and etiquette are that they both discuss human behavior and regulate it. Hence, the terms ethics and etiquette are not used for animals.

The result of the multiplication operation is called a darab. Multiplication of integers can be thought of as repeated addition; that is, the product of two numbers is the same as adding up as many copies of one of them as possible, the multiplication, as the quantity of the other, the \"multiplier\". These two numbers can be referred to as factors. For example, 4 times 3, written as 3\u00d74{\\displaystyle 3\\times 4} and pronounced as \"3 times 4\", can be calculated by adding 3 copies of 4 together: So 3 (multiplier) and 4 (multiplier) is the factor, and 12 is the product. One of the main properties of multiplication is the commutative property, which states that adding 3 copies of 4 gives the same result as adding 4 copies of 3: Thus the designation of the multiplier and the multiplier does not affect the product. The multiplication of integers (including negative numbers), rational numbers (fractions) and real numbers is defined by a systematic generalization of these basic definitions. Multiplication is also visualized as counting objects arranged in a rectangle (for integers), or finding the area of \u200b\u200ba rectangle whose sides have a certain length. The area of \u200b\u200ba rectangle is independent of which side is measured first\u2014a consequence of the commutative property. The product of two measurements is a new type of measurement.

For example, Code sign in Unicode at U+00D7 \u00d7 multiplication sign (HTML: \u00d7 \u00d7). There is another mathematical notation for multiplication: In computer programming, the asterisk (as in 5*2) is still the most common notation. This is due to the fact that most computers have historically been limited to small character sets (such as ASCII and EBCDIC) that do not have a multiplication sign (such as \u22c5 or \u00d7), while an asterisk appears on every keyboard. This usage comes from the FORTRAN programming language. The result of the multiplication is called darab. The product of integers is the multiple of each factor.

In the late 19th century, animosity began to flare between the Tswana people from Botswana and the Ndebele people who had moved to the area from the Kalahari Desert.

An expansion of the British central government and the development of tribal governments resulted in the establishment in 1920 of 2 advisory councils representing Africans and Europeans. The proclamation in 1934 regulated tribal rule and power. A European-African advisory council was created in 1951, and the 1961 constitution established a consultative legislative council.",

According to Muhammad Mustafa, the scope of discussion in criminology can be divided into: The basics of criminological theory, namely: It is an initial thought that was developed on the basis of irrational thinking, where a criminal behavior committed by an individual is the influence of an evil spirit (demon = Devil). Right or wrong behavior is determined by the definition of the chief or person who is considered a god. This thinking is still conventional where the most serious violation for Demonologists is to use black magic or known as black magic. The punishments used are also still traditional in nature which are aimed at expelling evil spirits within the individual, such as burning individuals who have black magic. In the explanation of classical thought, evil behavior by humans is a reflection of the concept of \"free will\". In an explanation of classical thinking with the concept of free will, it assumes that individuals have choices and thoughts to determine the actions they will take.

The size of the image or image produced by a microscope can reach millions of times the size of the original object. The magnification produced by a microscope depends on the type of microscope used. The types of microscopes can be grouped by various categories. One way is through the methods used by the instrument to interact with the sample and generate images. For example by sending a beam of light or electrons through a sample in an optical path, and detecting the emission of photons from that sample to form an image or image, or by scanning the surface of the sample a short distance with a probe. The two types of microscopes that are often used are the optical microscope (often referred to as a light microscope) and the electron microscope. The science that studies small objects using a microscope is called microscopy. The benefit of using a microscope is being able to measure objects that cannot be measured with high accuracy by conventional measuring instruments, such as bacteria, viruses, blood cells and cells of living organisms. The microscope has a measuring scale that can coincide with the image of an object so that the size of the object can be known with certainty. Lens-like objects have been recorded as far back as 4,000 years ago, where Greek records of the optical properties of a ball filled with water (5th century BC) were continued for centuries. However, the earliest known use of a simple microscope (magnifying glass) dates back to the widespread use of lenses in spectacles in the 13th century. The earliest known example of a compound microscope (English: compound microscope), which combines an objective lens near the specimen with an eyepiece to view the real image, appeared in Europe around 1620.",

Another claim was made by a neighboring county that was a competitor to the spectacle maker, Hans Lippershey (the first person to patent a telescope in 1608). In addition, there are also claims that the compound microscope was invented by the expatriate Cornelis Drebbel who owned another version of this microscope in London in 1619. Galileo Galilei (also sometimes cited as the inventor of the compound microscope) allegedly invented the compound microscope after 1610 when he managed to focus his telescope on small objects, and after seeing a compound microscope built by Drebbel and shown at an exhibition in Rome in 1624, Galileo created an improved version of the microscope. Giovanni Faber gave the name \"microscope\" to Galileo's compound microscope which was submitted to the Accademia dei Lincei in 1625. Prior to that, Galileo called his instrument \"occhiolino\" or \"little eye\". The first detailed description of the microscopic anatomy of organic tissue based on the use of a microscope did not appear until 1644, in Giambattista Odierna's L'occhio della mosca, or The Fly's Eye. In general, the microscope was a novelty until the 1660s and 1670s when naturalists in Italy, Holland and England began using it to study biology. The Italian scientist Marcello Malpighi, who is called the father of histology by some historians of biology, began his analysis of the biological structure of the lung.

Other protists, such as Kinetoplastid and Apicomplexa, are dangerous diseases for humans, such as malaria and trypanosomiasis. Protists were first proposed by Ernst Haeckel. Traditionally, protists are classified into several groups based on their similarity to a higher kingdom, which include Protozoa which resemble single-celled animals, Protophyta which resemble plants (the majority of single-celled algae), as well as slime molds and water molds which resemble mushrooms.

In general, protozoa can move actively because they have locomotion in the form of pseudopodia, whip feathers (flagellum), vibrating feathers (cilia), but some do not have locomotion. Protozoa mostly reproduce asexually by binary fission. Some other Protozoa perform sexual reproduction by the union of generative cells (gamete cells) or by the union of the vegetative cell nucleus. Sexual reproduction by fusion of the vegetative nuclei is called conjugation. Some protozoa are holozoic, holophytic and saprozoic. Holozoic means eating organisms that are smaller than their body size. Holophytic means able to produce their own food through the process of photosynthesis. The saprozoik means eating dead organisms that have decayed. The way of life of protozoa is solitary, some are colonies. If environmental conditions are unfavorable, protozoa can protect themselves by forming cysts. If the environment returns to normal, the protozoa will become active again.

From a geopolitical point of view, the term empire has different interpretations, ranging from an extreme territorial state on the strongest side, to a state that is only a union of several city-states on its weakest side. The term Maharajaan was known for the first time in history and the Indonesian language was derived from the influence of ancient India, namely Sanskrit; Maharaja, i.e. \"King above Kings\"; hence the term Maharajaan refers to a great Kingdom which is in charge of many other kingdoms. Great empires such as Sriwijaya and Majapahit are known in Indonesian history. Another term comes from European influence, namely Imperium which comes from the Latin meaning \"strength\" or \"authority\". Another term Empire derived from the name of Caesar, the ruler of the Roman Empire. Etymologically, the use of the term \"empire\" denotes a powerful centralized nation-state, but in looser usage it also refers to large-scale transnational corporations. The political structure of an empire was constructed in two ways: (i) as a territorial empire by direct conquest by force (direct physical action to fulfill the emperor's ambitions), and (ii) as a coercive hegemonic empire, by indirect conquest through the control of power (the perception that the emperor can impose his will). The first concept provides for greater powers and direct political control, but limits further development by absorbing military power within a given garrison. The second concept provides for less power and indirect control, but allows military power to expand further. Territorial empires (examples: the Mongol Empire, and the Persian Empire) tended to be territorial in nature.",

In the 15th century BC, the New Kingdom of Ancient Egypt under Thutmosis III was the earliest empire in Africa that united Nubia and the city-states of the Levant. The earliest empire comparable to the Roman Empire was the Assyrian Empire (2000\u2013612 BC). One of the most successful empires was the vast and multi-cultural Persian Empire, the Achaemenid Empire (550\u2013330 BC), which absorbed Mesopotamia, Egypt, parts of Greece, Thrasia, and most of the Middle East, central Asia, and northwestern India (now Pakistan). The Mauryan Empire was the most geographically extensive and powerful empire in ancient India, ruled by the Mauryan dynasty from 321 to 185 BC. The Roman Empire was the most extensive western empire until the modern period. Formerly the Macedonian kingdom under Alexander the Great became a vast empire stretching from Greece to northwestern India. After Alexander the Great's death, his empire split into four empires, all of which are commonly called the Hellenistic Empires.

One is from the Proto-Germanic word frankon which means javelin or lance because of the Frankish throwing ax known as francisca. Another etymology is that in an Old Germanic language, Frank meant \"free\" referring to slaves.

Electrons in non-metals behave differently than electrons in metals. With a few exceptions, nonmetals stay in place, so they are usually poor conductors of heat and electricity and are brittle when solid. Electrons in metals generally move freely and this is why metals are good conductors and most are easily flattened into sheets and pulled into wires. Nonmetal atoms have moderate to high electronegativity; they tend to withdraw electrons in chemical reactions and form acidic compounds. Two nonmetals, hydrogen and helium, make up about 99% of the ordinary matter in the observable universe by mass. The five non-metallic elements, hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and silicon, largely make up the Earth's crust, atmosphere, oceans, and biosphere. Most nonmetals have biological, technological, or domestic roles or uses. Living organisms are composed almost entirely of hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen. Nearly all nonmetals have specific uses in medicine and pharmaceuticals; lighting and lasers; as well as household items. Although the term nonmetal dates back at least to 1566, there is no single, widely agreed upon definition of nonmetal. Some elements have a marked mixture of metallic and non-metallic properties; which of these limit cases count as a nonmetal may vary depending on the classification criteria. Fourteen elements are effectively always identified as nonmetals, and up to about nine more elements are occasionally added, as shown in the accompanying periodic table extract.

The decisions involved depend on which property or properties are considered most indicative of non-metallic or metallic character. Although Steudel, as of 2020, recognizes twenty-three elements as nonmetals, such a list is open to challenge. The fourteen elements that are effectively always recognized as non-metals are hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur; the halogens which are corrosive to fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine; and the noble gases helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and radon; see e.g. Larra\u00f1aga et al. Although the same authors recognize carbon, phosphorus and selenium as nonmetals, Vernon has previously reported that these three elements are sometimes counted as metalloids. The elements commonly known as metalloids are boron; silicon and germanium; arsenic and antimony; and tellurium is sometimes counted as an intermediate class between a metal and a non-metal when the criteria used to distinguish between a metal and a non-metal are inconclusive. Other times they are counted as nonmetals based on their nonmetallic chemical properties. Of the 118 known elements, the 23 that can be considered non-metals are several times outnumbered by metals. Astatine, the fifth halogen, is often overlooked because of its rarity and intense radioactivity; theory and experimental evidence suggest that it is a metal. The superheavy elements copernium (Z = 112), flerovium (114), and oganesson (118) can turn into non-metals; their actual status has not been confirmed.

About 6,400 surviving mammal species have been described. The largest order in mammals is Rodentia (rodents), Chiroptera (bats), and Eulipotyphla (porcupines, moles, shrews, and so on).

In cladistics, which reflect evolutionary history, mammals are the only surviving members of the Synapsids. Synapsida and Sauropsida (reptiles and birds) are included in the larger clade Amniota. The early ancestors of Synapsid mammals were Sphenacodontia under Pelycosauria, the group which also includes the nonmammalian Dimetrodon.

Mammals can communicate and vocalize in a number of ways, including generating ultrasonics, scent marking, giving alarm signals, singing, and using echolocation. Mammals can organize themselves into fission-fusion groups, harems, and hierarchies, but they can also be solitary and territorial. Most mammals are polygynous, but some mammals can be monogamous or polyandry.

Iron is the most common element on Earth by mass, making up most of Earth's outer and inner core. Iron is the fourth most abundant element in the earth's crust. Its abundance in rocky planets such as Earth is due to the abundance of production due to fusion reactions in high-mass stars, where production of nickel-56 (which decays into the most common isotope of iron) is the last exothermic nuclear fusion reaction. As a result, radioactive nickel was the last element to be produced before the violent supernova collapse. The collapse scattered iron radionuclide precursors into space. Like the other group 8 elements, iron exists in a wide range of oxidation states, \u22122 to +6, although +2 and +3 are the most common. Elemental iron occurs in meteorites and other low-oxygen environments, but is reactive with oxygen and water. The surface of fresh iron appears shiny silvery-gray, but it oxidizes in normal air to produce hydrated iron oxide, known as rust. Unlike other metals which form a passivation oxide layer, iron oxide takes up more space than the metal itself and then flakes off, exposing the fresh surface to corrosion. Ferrous metal has been used since ancient times, although copper alloys, which have a lower melting point, were used earlier in human history. Pure iron is relatively soft, but cannot be obtained through smelting. This material hardens and is strengthened significantly by impurities, particularly carbon, from the smelting process.

Iron plays an important role in biology, forming complexes with molecular oxygen in hemoglobin and myoglobin; these two compounds are oxygen-transporting proteins in vertebrates. Iron is also a metal in the active site of most redox enzymes that play a role in cellular respiration and oxidation and reduction in plants and animals. The mechanical properties of iron and its alloys can be evaluated using a variety of tests, including the Brinell test, Rockwell test and Vickers hardness test. The data on iron is so consistent that it is often used for equipment calibration or comparison tests. However, the mechanical properties of iron are greatly affected by the purity of the sample: single crystalline pure iron for research purposes is in fact softer than aluminum, and the purest industrially produced iron (99.99%) has a hardness of 20\u201330 Brinell.

The very strong triple bond in elementary nitrogen (N\u2261N), the second strongest bond in diatomic molecules after carbon monoxide (CO), dominates nitrogen chemistry. This causes difficulties for both organisms and industry in converting N2 into useful compounds, but at the same time, burning, detonating, or decomposing nitrogen compounds to form nitrogen gas releases large amounts of energy which are often beneficial. Synthetic ammonia and nitrates are the main industrial fertilizers, and nitrate fertilizers are the main pollutants in the eutrophication of water systems.

        "paragraph": "A function is said to be integrated if the integral of the function over its domain is finite. In essence a and b are called integral limits. An integral for which a limit is determined is called a definite integral. The integral is said to exceed the interval a, b]. When the integral is moved from the finite value a to the upper limit of infinity, the integral expresses the limit of the integral from a to the value b because b is infinite. If the integral value gets closer to the finite value, then the integral is said to be able to merge to that value. Otherwise, the integral is said to deviate. When the limit is omitted, the integral is called an indefinite integral, which represents a class of functions (antiderivatives) whose derivatives are integrands. The fundamental theorem of calculus links the evaluation of definite integrals to indefinite integrals. Sometimes, integration limits are omitted for certain integrals when the same limits appear repeatedly in certain contexts. Usually, the author will explain this convention at the beginning of the relevant text. There are several extensions to the integral notation to include integration over infinite domains, and/or over multiple dimensions (see the next section of this article). Historically, the symbol dx was taken to represent an infinitesimal \"small part\" of the independent variable x, which would be multiplied by the integrand and summed in an infinite sense. While this notion was still heuristically useful, later mathematicians considered infinitesimal numbers untenable from the point of view of the real number system. In introductory calculus, the expression dx is therefore not assigned an independent meaning; instead, it is seen as part of the symbol of integration and serves as its delimiter on the right side of the expression being integrated. In more sophisticated contexts, dx can have its own significance, the meaning of which depends on the specific area of \u200b\u200bmathematics being discussed.",

Even so, studies with related topics have long been carried out by researchers. The birth of the science of archeoastronomy was initially based on the interest of archaeologists in the 1960s to study the relationship of the monuments of ancient civilizations such as the Pyramids of Giza, Stonehenge and Newgrange to the constellations of stars, planets and the movement of the Sun. Over time, the themes and problems studied in archeoastronomy began to expand. Archeoastronomy no longer only examines the relation of ancient monuments to the sky, but begins to pay attention to concepts related to culture, calendars, ancient navigation systems, to political events. \u2014Syanislaw Iwaniszewski, (Alignments and Orientations Again).

Meanwhile, the brown archeoastronomy approach deals more with research involving social data and is used to investigate the culture of the indigenous peoples of the Americas (New World). To obtain accurate conclusions, these two types of approaches should be combined with each other. Research conducted on ancient monuments in the Old World (Asia, Africa and Europe) to find their association with celestial bodies such as planets, star constellations, the Sun, comets and the Moon, generally uses statistical data. This statistical data is the result of calculating the relative position of these celestial bodies to the intended monument or archeoastronomical site. This approach is called the green archaeoastronomy approach. The green archeoastronomy approach involves rigorous data selection and field methodologies. The use of this approach, for example, in research conducted in the 1970s at Stonehenge. This study aims to find the relationship between the orientation or landscape of the site with the position and angle of inclination of the Sun and Moon. However, the lack of social data such as historical records, reliefs, or rituals found or studied to support this conclusion, has resulted in the association of Stonehenge with the movements of the Moon and Sun from the results of this research still being debated. This then becomes a separate criticism of the green archeoastronomy approach which is considered to ignore socio-cultural aspects. The brown archeoastronomy approach emerged in the 1970s in North America, when studies and research were carried out on the relationship between the cultures of the indigenous peoples of North America and Mesoamerica (Central America) in the pre-Columbian period with astronomy.",

The relationship is visualized in the form of an evolutionary tree (cladogram, phylogenetic tree). This branch of science is closely related and sometimes even considered synonymous with taxonomy. Systematics biology is a branch of biology that studies the classification system and nomenclature of organisms. The word systematics comes from the Latin word \"systema\", which means the systematic order of organisms. Biological systematics studies what characterizes a species and how these species relate to each other over time. Therefore, systematics is used as the basis of the evolution of life. To study the relationships between these organisms, specifically, researchers in biological systematics need to do: Systematics is sometimes confused with taxonomy. However, systematics is broader than taxonomy. The relationships studied in biological systematics are visualized through the branches of the evolutionary tree. There are two evolutionary trees: a phylogeny that describes the actual relationships between organisms in evolution and a cladogram that explains the hypotheses. Phylogeny has two components: branching order (describes the relationships between living things) and branch length (indicates how much a trait changes). As many species are studied in biology, over time, the classification and organization of these species has become a complex sub-discipline of biology. This researcher is called a biosystematicist and his field is called biosystematics. In studying biological systematics, researchers use branches to explain the relationships between different organisms. This branch is used for various applications in modern systematics. Biological systematics uses three ways to create branches that classify species. Numerical systematics or biometry uses statistics to identify and classify animals.",

With specific branches like this, researchers can apply knowledge in systematics in several fields: Although the application of systematics uses various complex methods, actually all hierarchies of biological classification are essentially hypothetical, which means that humans subjectively determine what the name of the organism is and classify it. the organism. In 1970, Michener et al explained the difference between biological systematics and taxonomy and their relationship with each other as explained as follows: Systematic biology (hereinafter referred to as systematics) is the field of biology which (a) gives scientific names to organisms, (b) describes them, (c ) maintain collections, (d) provide classifications for organisms, keys to their identification, and data on their distribution, (e) investigate their evolutionary history, and (f) study their adaptations to the environment. Systematics is a field with a long history which in recent years has experienced an important renaissance, especially with regard to theoretical content. Part of the theoretical material is related to the field of evolution (topics e and f above), the rest is related to classification problems. Taxonomy is part of systematics related to topics (a) to (d) above. Europeans usually use systematics and biosystematics to study biodiversity as a whole, while for this, Americans usually use the terms taxonomy. However, taxonomy is more often used specifically for the identification, description, and naming of organisms.

After the fall of the Qing dynasty, controversies arose around the status of areas dominated by ethnic minorities, such as Tibet and Mongolia. Although the last Qing Emperor to abdicate had bestowed all Qing territory to the newly born republic, the position of the Mongols and Tibetans at that time was only loyal to the Qing monarch, so they did not feel loyal to the republican government that had replaced the Qing monarchy.

Identity originates from the theory of social identity put forward by Henri Tajfel and John Turner in 1979. The theory was originally developed to understand the psychological basis of discrimination between groups. Tajfel and Turner attempted to identify the minimal conditions that would bring members of one group to discriminate against members of another group. Sexual identity refers to the identification of a person with different categories of sexuality. It can be heterosexual, gay, lesbian and bisexual. The sexual identity that we have will affect what we consume. What television programs will we watch or what magazines will we read. Sexual identity can also affect one's job. Gender identity is a view of masculinity and femininity and what it means to be a man or a woman. The meaning of being a woman or a man is strongly influenced by cultural views. For example, activities that are considered more masculine or more feminine. Gender expressions not only communicate who we are, but also construct the sense we desire. Gender identity is also indicated by the style of communication. The female communication style is often described as supportive, egalitarian, personal and disclosive, while the male communication style is described as competitive and assertive.

William Shakespeare, Cervantes' great contemporary, had clearly read Don Quixote, but it is almost certain that Cervantes never heard of Shakespeare.

Due to its varied geography and climate, Peru has high biodiversity with 21,462 species of plants and animals reported in 2003, of which 5,855 are endemic, and is a megadiverse country. Peru has more than 1,800 species of birds (120 of which are endemic), more than 500 species of mammals, more than 300 species of reptiles, and more than 1,000 species of freshwater fish. Hundreds of mammals including endangered species such as cougars, jaguars and spectacled bears. Peruvian birds produce large quantities of guano, an economically important export. The Pacific harbors large quantities of sea bass, flounder, anchovies, tuna, crustaceans and shellfish, and is home to many sharks, sperm whales and whales. President Alejandro Toledo is the current leader of the Peruvian state, and the Chairman of Per\u00fa Posible. He was elected with 53% of the vote in the second round of elections in 2001, defeating former socialist president Alan Garc\u00eda P\u00e9rez. Per\u00fa Posible won 45 seats out of 120 seats in parliament. For the second and third positions, respectively, were occupied by Partido Aprista Peruano (PAP, 28 seats) led by Alan Garc\u00eda P\u00e9rez, and Unidad Nacional (UN, 17 seats) led by Lourdes Flores Nano. Peru's territory is divided into 25 regions (plural:regiones; singular: regi\u00f3n). These regions are divided into provinces, which are made up of districts.",

During World War II, the Wehrmacht consisted of the Heer (Army), Kriegsmarine (Navy) and Luftwaffe (Air Force). The term \"Wehrmacht\" comes from a compound German word: wehren, \"to defend\" and macht, \"force\" and literally means \"To defend force\". after the rise of the NSDAP, the term Wehrmacht began to be used in a general sense to refer to the armed forces of any nation, which functioned as \"fatherland defense\". For example, the term Britische Wehrmacht means to refer to the British armed forces. Article 47 of the 1919 Constitution of the Weimar Republic stated \"the Reichspr\u00e4sident shall have supreme authority over all the armed forces of the Reich\". To give a characteristic, the term Reichswehr is used to refer to the German armed forces. In 1935, or when the Nazis rose, the Reichswehr was changed to the Wehrmacht. Thus, the term Wehrmacht was used unofficially to refer to the German armed forces during the 3rd Reich and World War II. By law, the Commander-in-Chief of the Wehrmacht was Adolf Hitler in his capacity as President of Germany, a position which Hitler assumed after the death of President Paul von Hindenburg in August 1934. By founding the Wehrmacht in 1935, Hitler appointed himself Supreme Commander of the Wehrmacht's Armed Forces, retaining his position as President or Chancellor until his suicide on April 30, 1945. The title Commander in Chief was given to the Minister of the Reichswehr, namely Werner von Blomberg who was simultaneously renamed the Reich Minister of War. After the Blomberg-Fritsch Affair, Blomberg resigned and Hitler abolished the Wehrmacht's Ministry of War system. Instead of the ministry, the Wehrmacht High Command, namely Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW), under Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel, was placed in place of the Ministry of War.",

The OKW was intended to function as joint command and coordinate all military activities, with Hitler as its superior. Although many senior officers such as von Manstein, OKW had advocated for a real tri-service Joint Command, or the appointment of a single Joint Chief of Staff, Hitler refused. Even after his crushing defeat at Stalingrad, Hitler had refused, declaring that G\u00f6ring, as Reichsmarschall and Hitler's deputy, would not be ruled by anyone else or see himself as equal to other service Wehrmacht military commanders. However, a more likely reason was that Hitler feared it would damage his image of the \"Midas touch\" on military strategy. By establishing the OKW, Hitler solidified his control over the Wehrmacht. Showing restraint early in the war, Hitler also became increasingly involved in the military operations conducted by Germany. In addition, there is a clear cohesiveness between the three High Commands and the OKW, as senior generals are not aware of the needs, capabilities and limitations of the other branches. With Hitler serving as Commander-in-Chief, branch commands were often forced to fight over influence with Hitler. However, influence with Hitler came not only from rank and merit, but also those whom Hitler viewed as loyal, leading to inter-service competition, not cohesion between his military advisers. According to estimates, 6,000,000 soldiers were injured during the war, while more than 11,000,000 soldiers became prisoners of war. Overall, some 5,318,000 soldiers from Germany and other nations fighting for the German armed forces, including personnel from the Waffen-SS, Volkssturm, and foreign collaborators are thought to have died in combat, or died from wounds, and also died in custody by allies or lost in World War II.",

An axiom is also interpreted as a statement that contains basic terms and defined terms and does not stand alone and is not tested for truth. However, axioms in mathematics do not mean self-evident propositions. Rather, a starting point of a logical system. For example, 1+1=2{\\displaystyle 1+1=2} Another name for an axiom is a postulate. An axiom is the basis of a formal logic system which together with the rules of inference define logic. In the end, an axiom is a statement whose truth is certain. The term axiom is most commonly used as a term in mathematics, the target or object of mathematical study in the form of facts, concepts, operations and principles that require certain methods to find the truth or validity of the concepts contained therein. The object of this study uses symbols that are empty of meaning, meaning that every symbol used in mathematics is an abstract symbol. This feature allows mathematics to enter the field of study or other branches of knowledge. In essence, mathematical thinking is based on agreements called axioms. Therefore mathematics is an axiomatic system. One of the phenomena about existing axioms is that for 2000 years axioms about numbers and geometry have been considered a definite truth because theorems are a logical consequence of axioms, so theorems are considered undeniable truths. The word axiom comes from the Greek word \u1f00\u03be\u03af\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1 (Axioma), a verbal noun from the verb \u1f00\u03be\u03b9\u03cc\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd (Axioein), meaning \"to deem worthy\", but also \"to require\", which in turn comes from \u1f04\u03be\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 (\u00e1xios), meaning \" balanced\", and therefore \"has (same) value (as)\", \"deserves\", \"deserves\".",

The term axiom is also understood in mathematics. The word axiom in mathematics is also called postulate. The basic meaning of the word postulate is \"to demand\"; for example, Euclid demanded that one agree that some things could be done (for example, any two points could be joined by a straight line). Ancient geometry retained some differences between axioms and postulates. While commenting on Euclid's books, Proclus states that \"Geminus argued that this Postulate should not be classed as a postulate but as an axiom, for it does not, like the first three Postulates, assert the possibility of several constructions but expresses an important property.\" Boethius translates 'postulates' as petitio and calls the axiom notiones communes but in later manuscripts this usage is not always strictly preserved. The logic-deductive method by which conclusions (new knowledge) follow from premises (old knowledge) through the application of sound arguments (syllogisms, rules of inference) was developed by the ancient Greeks, and has become a core tenet of modern mathematics. Tautologies are excluded, nothing can be concluded if nothing is assumed. The axioms and postulates are thus the basic assumptions that underlie certain bodies of deductive knowledge. They were accepted without demonstration. All other statements (theorems, in the case of mathematics) must be proved with the help of these basic assumptions. However, interpretations of mathematical knowledge have changed from ancient to modern times, and consequently the terms axioms and postulates mean slightly different things to today's mathematicians, than they do to Aristotle and Euclid.

Definitions are also interpreted as descriptions of meanings that function to limit objects, concepts, and situations based on the time and place of a study.

Nominal definition explains a word with other commonly understood words. Nominal definition is mainly used at the beginning of a conversation or discussion. There are six types of nominal definitions, namely synonymous definitions, symbolic definitions, etymological definitions, semantic definitions, stipulative definitions, and denotative definitions. The stipulative definition is the definition used when determining the use of the term. Stipulative definitions must be judged not as right or wrong but as useful or useless. These definitions determine the meaning to be used for the term in other senses creating a technical vocabulary. It can also be referred to as a clarifying definition that defines which is clearer for terms that are not clear.

While religion is difficult to define, a standard model of religion, used in lectures on religious studies, was proposed by Clifford Geertz, who simply calls it a \"cultural system\". A critique of the Geertz model by Talal Asad categorizes religion as \"an anthropological category.\" Many religions have mythologies, symbols, and sacred histories that purport to explain the meaning, purpose of life and the origins of life or the universe. From their beliefs about the cosmos and human nature, people derive morality, ethics, customary laws, or preferred lifestyles. According to some estimates, there are about 4,200 religions in the world. Many religions may have organized behavior, clergy, definitions of what constitutes obedience or membership, holy places, and holy books.

The term physiology comes from the Greek words physis and logos which mean nature and story. The scientific method used in physiology aims to study the physical and chemical functions of biomolecules, cells, tissues, organs, organ systems, and organisms as a whole. The study of physiology began when the anatomist William Harvey described the existence of blood circulation in the 17th century AD. Physiology then became a scientific discipline through a textbook titled Institutiones Medicae (1708) written and taught by Herman Boerhaave in Leiden. Physiology does not care about the types of living things studied. The term \"physiology\" is borrowed from the Dutch language, physiologie, which is formed from two Ancient Greek words: \u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2, physis, meaning \"origin\" or \"substance\" and \u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1, logia, meaning \"study\".

Physiology is one of the fields of science that is the object of the Nobel Prize (Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine). Other sciences have developed from physiology considering that this science is quite old. Some important derivatives are biochemistry, biophysics, biomechanics, cell genetics, pharmacology, and ecophysiology. The development of molecular biology influences the direction of the study of physiology. The science of human physiology dates from around 420BC to the time of Hippocrates, who is also known as the father of medicine. Aristotle's critical thinking and attention to the relationship between structure and function marked the beginning of the science of physiology in Ancient Greece. Jean Fernel, a French researcher, introduced the term \"physiology\" in 1525.

In the 19th century, the science of physiology began to develop rapidly, especially in 1838 with the discovery of the cell theory by Matthias Schleiden and Theodor Schwann. Radically this theory states that organisms are composed of units called cells. Claude Bernard (1813\u20131878) later discovered the concept of milieu interieur (internal environment), which was later referred to as \"homeostasis\" by the American researcher, Walter Cannon. In the 20th century, biologists also developed an interest in how organisms other than humans function, which gave rise to comparative physiology and ecophysiology. In recent years, evolutionary physiology has become a subdiscipline of physiology. Physiology in the field of medicine plays a very large role. As a result of the in-depth study, there are several subfields. Electrophysiology deals with how nerves and muscles work; neurophysiology studies the physiology of the brain; Cell physiology refers to the function of individual cells. Many fields are related to physiology, including Ecophysiology which studies the influence of the environment on physiological changes in the bodies of animals and plants. Genetics is not the only factor that influences the physiology of animals and plants. Environmental stress also often causes damage to eukaryotic organisms. Organisms that do not live in aquatic habitats must store water in a cellular environment. In such organisms, dehydration can be a major problem. Dehydration in humans can occur when there is an increase in physical activity. In the field of exercise physiology, various studies have been conducted on the effect of dehydration on homeostasis. Animal physiology stems from the methods and equipment used in studying human physiology which then extends to animal species other than humans. Plant physiology makes extensive use of techniques from both of these fields.",

This ion is a positive ion present when an Arrhenius acid dissolves in water, because an Arrhenius acid molecule in solution releases a proton (a positive hydrogen ion, H+) to the surrounding water molecules (H2O). The amount of hydronium ions relative to the hydroxide ions determines the pH value of a solution. Molecules in pure water auto-dissociate (ie: react with each other) into hydronium and hydroxide ions in the following equilibrium: In pure water, there are equal amounts of hydroxide and hydronium ions, so the solution is neutral. At 25\u00b0C, water has a pH of 7 (this value varies as the temperature changes). A pH value less than 7 indicates an acidic solution, and a pH value greater than 7 indicates an alkaline solution. According to the IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry, the hydronium ion is best referred to as oxonium. Hydroxonium can also be used to clearly identify it. The draft IUPAC proposal also recommends the use of oxonium and oxidonium in the context of organic and inorganic chemistry, respectively. An oxonium ion is any ion with a trivalent oxygen cation. For example, a protonated hydroxyl group is an oxonium ion, but not a hydronium ion. Because O+ and N have the same number of electrons, H3O+ is isoelectronic with ammonia. As shown in the figure above, H3O+ has a trigonal pyramidal molecular geometry with an oxygen atom at the apex. The H\u2013O\u2013H bond angle is approximately 113\u00b0, and the center of mass is very close to the oxygen atom. Since the base of the pyramid consists of three identical hydrogen atoms, the configuration of the molecular symmetry of H3O+ is as if it belongs to the C3v point group.",

The transition dipole is located along the c-axis and, because the negative charge is localized near the oxygen atom, the dipole moment is apex, perpendicular straight to the ground plane. Hydronium is a cation formed from water in the presence of hydrogen ions. These hydrons do not exist in a free state: they are highly reactive and are dissolved by water. An acidic solute is generally the source of these hydrons; However, hydronium is present even in pure water. This special case where water reacts with water to produce hydronium (and hydroxide) ions is commonly known as self-ionization of water. The hydronium ions produced are few and short-lived. pH is a measure of the relative activity of hydronium and hydroxide ions in aqueous solutions. In acidic solutions, hydronium is more active, excess protons readily available for reaction with basic species. The hydronium ion is highly acidic: at 25\u00b0C, its pK is \u22121.7. It is the most acidic species that can exist in water (assuming sufficient water for dissolution): a strong acid will ionize and protonate water molecules to form hydronium. The acidity of hydronium is an implicit standard used to judge the strength of acids in water: a strong acid must be a better proton donor than hydronium, otherwise most of the acid will be in the non-ionized state (ie: a weak acid). Unlike hydronium in neutral solution which results from the autodissociation of water, hydronium ions in acidic solution are durable and concentrated, proportional to the strength of the dissolved acid. pH was originally conceived to be a measure of the hydrogen ion concentration in an aqueous solution.",

Meanwhile, international communism is an ideological blend originating from Lenin's thoughts, so it can also be called \"Marxism\u2013Leninism\". In communism, social change must start from taking over the means of production through the role of the communist party. In summary, the logic is that social change begins with the workers, or better known as the proletariat (see: The Holy Family), but the organization of workers can only succeed through party struggle. The party needs the role of the Politburo as a think-tank. It can be summarized that social change can only be successful if it is initiated by the Politburo. Communism as anti-capitalism uses the communist party system as a means of taking over power and strongly opposes the ownership of accumulated capital in individuals. In principle, everything is represented as belonging to the people and therefore, all means of production must be controlled by the state for the people's prosperity evenly. Communism introduces the use of a representative democratic system carried out by communist party elites. Therefore it greatly limits direct democracy to people who are not members of the communist party. Therefore, in communism, individual rights are not recognized as found in liberalism.

In the 11th century Goryeo, which replaced Unified Silla, built a summer palace in Seoul, which was referred to as the \"Capital of the South\". It was from this period that Seoul became a larger settlement. When Joseon replaced Goryeo, the capital was moved to Seoul (also known as Hanyang or Hanseong).",

Ethnography has been known since anthropology began to develop, namely at the end of the 15th century when European, Asian, American and Australian explorers began to visit. Initially the explorers had a mission to conquer the new territory, but encountered obstacles such as resistance from the natives. In its development, other explorers who served as travelers, sailors, priests, missionaries of Christianity, Bible translators, and government officials wrote stories of their journeys to their destination countries which were compiled in the form of diaries or travel journals in the form of descriptions of customs, social structure, language and physical characteristics of various ethnic groups in Africa, Asia, Oceania (namely the islands in Lawan Teduh) and Indian tribes, native Americans. Ethnographers by the Europeans at that time had the function of knowing the spread of human culture, building colonies (colonies) and looking for the weaknesses of indigenous tribes and then conquering them. At the end of World War II, ethnography served to apply other sciences, especially for the implementation of development programs.

Aging has a broad meaning, one of which is aging is the life cycle from when humans are born, through childhood, adolescence, adulthood, to the point where humans feel old. However, in the process of aging, all living things are not the same in terms of time. Some people age faster, and some people age more slowly. This is because the aging process is a fairly broad phenomenon, involving physical, psychological, and social processes. Biologically, aging is the result of all the accumulation of molecular and cellular damage over time. This causes reduced physical and mental capacity, and increases the risk of disease and death. Old age also causes hearing loss, cataracts, osteoarthritis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, depression and dementia. The worst impact of aging in old age is geriatric syndrome. Aging also results in a loss of the ability of the network to repair itself, and it is no longer able to maintain its normal function. This causes a decline in organ structure and function. Physical signs of aging can be felt by reduced muscle mass, increased fat, wrinkles on the skin, and reduced memory ability. Signs of aging are psychologically marked by decreased passion for life, difficulty sleeping, often feeling anxious, and irritable. The wear and tear theory is a theory regarding aging which states that aging occurs due to excessive damage to cells making it difficult for the body to repair. The process of cell damage continues to occur from time to time. This theory was first coined by August Weismann a biologist from Germany in 1882.",

However, this theory has been criticized because for some living things such as vertebrates to lack hormones and complex neuroendocrine systems, they still age. The next theory of aging is about human genetic control, which is completely set in a person's DNA. As technology develops, the aging factor due to genetics can be overcome, by preventing damage and repairing DNA with technology. If the human body receives too many free radicals, it can cause oxidative stress. This can damage the cells in the body, and cause various diseases, as well as causing aging. Free radicals are considered to be the main cause of the aging process, besides being modified by genetic, and environmental factors. Free radicals have high reactivity to cause age-related cell and tissue damage. Oxidative modification of biological molecules consisting of lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids influences cell aging and death. UV rays are electromagnetic wave radiation caused by the sun. Exposure to UV radiation is one of the causes of oxidative stress on the skin that can cause aging. Frequent skin exposure to UV rays can lead to the formation of wrinkles, lesions, and cancer. On sun exposure, skin molecules absorb UVR which results in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The first hormone that influences the aging process is estrogen, which functions to produce collagen and elastin. When the hormone estrogen is reduced, human skin will experience wrinkles, the shape of an oval face is uneven. The impact on the body if there is a lack of the hormone estrogen is that you experience fatigue more quickly.",

This science basically studies various aspects of celestial objects such as their origin, physical/chemical properties, meteorology, and motion as well as how knowledge of these objects explains the formation and development of the universe. Astronomy as a science is one of the oldest, as it is known from astronomical artifacts dating back to the prehistoric era; for example the monuments from Egypt and Nubia, or Stonehenge which is from Britain. People from early civilizations such as Babylon, Ancient Greece, China, India and the Maya were also found to have made methodological observations of the night sky.

Quite a number of branches of science have been included as part of astronomy, and when one pays attention, the nature of these branches is very diverse: from astrometry, space-based navigation, observational astronomy, to calendar compilation and astrology. However, today professional astronomy is considered synonymous with astrophysics.

This metal element is silvery in color, hard, rather ductile, and corrodes easily in air and damp areas. When oxidized, neodymium reacts rapidly to give pink, purple or blue, and yellow compounds in oxidation states of +2, +3 and +4. Neodymium was discovered in 1885 by the Austrian chemist Carl Auer von Welsbach. The element can be found in significant quantities in the mineral monazite and bastn\u00e4site ores. Neodymium is not found naturally in metallic form or is not alloyed with other lanthanides and is usually reworked for common metal uses. Although neodymium is classed as a rare earth element, it is still widely distributed in the Earth's crust and is not as rare as cobalt, nickel, or copper. Most of the world's commercial neodymium is mined in China. At first, neodymium compounds were first widely used as a glass colorant in 1927. The color of neodymium compounds is due to the presence of Nd3+ ions which are generally reddish purple in color and can change depending on the type of lighting. This is due to the interaction of the sharp light absorption bands from neodymium with the surrounding light which is dominated by the emission bands of mercury, trivalent europium or terbium which look sharp. Some neodymium doped glass is used in the use of lasers which emit infrared with wavelengths between 1047 and 1062 nanometers.

Natural systems cannot be understood if we study them in isolation: they must be studied as a whole as a whole. The word 'holism' was first introduced in 1926 by Jan Smuts, a statesman from South Africa, in his book Holism and Evolution. The origin of the word 'holism' is taken from the Greek, holos, which means all or the whole. Smuts defines holism as a natural tendency to form a whole so that it is greater than the sum of its evolutionary parts. Examples of holism can be found throughout human history and in the most diverse socio-cultural contexts confirmed by many ethnological studies. A missionary from France, Maurice Leenhardt, coined the term cosmomorphism to indicate the existence of a perfect reciprocal relationship between a person and his environment. This is found in Melanesian people in New Caledonia. For the people of the area, an isolated individual has no clear status until he finds his position in the environment. By knowing an individual, it cannot be used as a benchmark that we already know a community. The opposite of holism is reductionism, which is an understanding that states that a complex system can be explained by studying the things that form the basis of the system (reduction). For example, a biological process can be explained through a chemical process. Then the chemical process can be explained through physical processes.

Holism can be viewed from a variety of scientific disciplines, there are several definitions of holism viewed from various disciplines, some of these meanings include the following disciplines: In the second half of the 20th century, holism refers to system thinking and its derivatives, such as the science of chaos and complexity. Systems in biology, psychology, sociology are often so complex that their behavior appears 'new', and cannot be deduced from the properties of the constituent elements alone. Holism has been used as a slogan. This contributes to the resistance encountered by scientific interpretations of holism which believe that there are ontological reasons that prevent reductive models in principle from providing efficient algorithms for predicting the behavior of systems within certain classes. Scientific holism believes that the behavior of a system cannot be perfectly predicted, no matter how much data is available. Natural systems can produce unpredictable behavior, and it is presumed that the behavior of the system is not computationally reducible, so one cannot predict the state of the system without a full simulation of all the events that occur in the system. A key characteristic of the high-order behavior of a particular class of systems can be mediated by rare 'surprises' in the behavior of its elements due to the principle of interconnectivity, so that it cannot be predicted except by brute-force methods.

He became a student of Plato while in Athens. Aristotle studied from Plato for 20 years. During his life, he wrote about philosophy and other sciences, namely physics, politics, ethics, biology and psychology. Aristotle divided philosophy into four issues, namely logic, physics, metaphysics and practical knowledge. Analysis of philosophy is done using a syllogism. Aristotle's thoughts regarding logic which utilize the deductive method are used as the basis for formal logic. Aristotle also believed that the existence of science was intended to support human life. Aristotle was born in a small town called Stagira in 384 BC. The city is part of the Kalkidiki peninsula. Aristotle's upbringing was carried out by his family in Atarneus, Anatolia. This condition was caused by his father dying at a young age during a trial in Pella, Central Macedonia. His father's occupation was as a physicist. At first, Aristotle was a student of Plato. But he later rejected some of Plato's thoughts and started his own philosophical thought. Aristotle founded an educational and research center called the Lyceum. Through this place, he conveyed his thoughts which then influenced the thinking of other philosophers, theologians or scientists. Aristotle lived in an environment that supported cultural and intellectual creativity. During his lifetime, the city-states of Greece were divided by the defeat of Athens by Sparta in the Peloponnesian War in 404 BC.

During thinking, the human mind escapes from observations that use the senses to feel everything that can be felt by its existence. General knowledge is then known from particular and real things. Physics knowledge is then formed through abstract knowledge and human reason. Furthermore, the abstraction of mathematics enables humans to understand invisible matter. Reason detaches itself from everything that can be understood. All the material characteristics of this abstraction then produce science. Meanwhile, the abstraction of metaphysics appears after humans do abstraction of physics. In the third abstraction, humans have been able to think about the reality of all matter along with its origins and purposes for its formation. Aristotle considers this abstraction to be the first philosophy. Aristotle used the term \"first philosophy\" instead of metaphysics because according to him all philosophy was derived from this abstraction. The first philosophy in Aristotle's view can be interpreted into two senses. The first is as science which is the first principle. While the second is a science that discusses existence as an existence along with the characteristics of objects. Aristotle argued that the method of discovering new knowledge and truth is divided into two. First, the inductive method and the second is the deductive method. The inductive method aims to conclude specific things into a general conclusion. Meanwhile, the deductive method only concludes the truth of two things that are certain and undoubted. The nature of the deductive method is to conclude from something that is general to be specific.",

Nutrients are elements or chemical compounds used in the metabolism of an organism. Nutrients are usually categorized into those that provide energy and those that are used as components for body or cell structures. A nutrient is called essential for organisms if the substance cannot be synthesized by organisms and must be met from food sources. In everyday usage, the term nutrient is often equated with nutrition. Among several nutrients, which are classified as organic nutrients are carbohydrates, fats, proteins, amino acids, but inorganic chemical compounds such as water (H\u2082O) and oxygen (O\u2082) can also be considered nutrients. The nutrients needed in small amounts are called micronutrients, while the nutrients needed in large amounts are called macronutrients. The effects of nutrients depend on the dose. Three types of macromolecules can be processed into energy through metabolism, namely carbohydrates, fats and proteins. Fat contains 9 kcal/g (~37.7 kJ/g) energy, protein and carbohydrates 4 kcal/g (~16.7 kJ/g), while ethanol (grain alcohol) contains 7 kcal/g (~ 29.3 kJ/g). The substances that support metabolism are: Plants absorb nutrients from the soil or from the air, or from water (especially aquatic plants). Of course with the exception of carnivorous plants which ingest nutrients from animals trapped in external plant traps. Chemical elements consumed in large quantities by plants in the form of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen are obtained in the form of water and carbon dioxide, while energy is obtained from sunlight. Nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur (sulphur) are also needed in relatively large quantities. All of these are called the \"big six\" macronutrient elements in all life which are usually sourced from inorganic compounds (eg carbon dioxide, water, nitrate, phosphate, sulfate) or organic compounds (eg carbohydrates, lipids, proteins).",

        "paragraph": "Vaccination is the administration of vaccines to help the immune system develop protection from a disease. Vaccination is a form of immunization. Vaccines themselves contain microorganisms or viruses that are weak, live or dead, or contain proteins or toxins from organisms. In stimulating the body's adaptive immunity, vaccines help prevent the body from becoming sick from infectious diseases. When a large percentage of the population has been vaccinated to a certain percentage, herd immunity is achieved. Herd immunity protects those who may have a compromised immune system and cannot be vaccinated. The effectiveness of vaccination has been extensively studied and verified. Vaccination is the most effective method of preventing infectious diseases; Widespread immunity as a result of vaccination played a major role in the worldwide eradication of variola and the elimination of diseases such as poliomyelitis and tetanus in many countries of the world. However, some diseases, such as measles in the United States, have seen an increase in cases due to relatively low vaccination rates in the 2010s, which is partly due to vaccine hesitancy. The first disease prevented by inoculation was most likely variola. The first recorded application of variolation occurred in the 16th century in China. Variola was also the first disease for which a vaccine was produced. Although at least six people had used the same principle years before, the variola vaccine was invented in 1796 by an English physician, Edward Jenner. He was the first to publish evidence that the variola vaccine was effective and to recommend its production. Louis Pasteur then continued the concept of vaccines through his works in microbiology. Variola is a contagious and deadly disease, causing the death of 20-60% of infected adults and more than 80% of infected children. When variola was finally eradicated in 1979, it had killed an estimated 300\u2013500 million people in the 20th century.",

        "paragraph": "Vaccination is an artificial way to activate the immune system to protect the body from infectious diseases. Activation occurs through exposure of the immune system to immunogens, ie substances capable of stimulating the immune system. The process of strengthening the immune system is known as immunization, which can occur actively or passively, naturally or artificially. Vaccination is a form of artificial active immunization that can be done in various ways to introduce immunogen into the body. Most vaccines are given before a person catches a disease to help increase protection in the future. However, some vaccines are given after a person has contracted a disease. Vaccines given after exposure to variola are reported to provide protection from the disease or can reduce the severity of the disease. Louis Pasteur gave the first rabies vaccination to a child after he was bitten by a rabid dog. Since its discovery, the rabies vaccine has been shown to be effective in preventing rabies in humans when given several times within 14 days after a dog bite along with rabies immunoglobulin administration and wound care. Other examples include administering experimental vaccines for AIDS, cancer, and Alzheimer's disease. Vaccination aims to trigger an immune response more quickly and with less harm than natural infection. Most vaccines are given by injection because the vaccine content is not absorbed properly by the intestine. Live attenuated vaccines, such as the polio vaccine, rotavirus, some types of typhus, and some cholera vaccines are given orally to produce immunity in the digestive system. Although vaccinations have a lasting effect, it usually takes several weeks for an immune response to develop. This is different from passive immunization (giving antibodies, such as during breastfeeding), which has an immediate effect. Vaccination failure is a condition when an organism catches a disease even though it has been vaccinated against the cause of the disease.",

        "paragraph": "One-chamber system (unicameral) is a government system that has only one chamber in the parliament or legislature. Many countries that use a single chamber system are often small, homogeneous unitary states and consider an upper house or second chamber unnecessary. Support for the one-chamber system is based on the notion that if the upper house is democratic, it merely reflects the lower house which is also democratic, and therefore is only a duplication (Double). Theories supporting this view argue that the functions of the second chamber, for example reviewing or revising laws, can be carried out by parliamentary committees, while efforts to safeguard the constitution can then be carried out through a written Constitution. Many countries that now have parliaments with a one-chamber system have previously adopted a two-chamber system, and recently abolished their upper house. One reason is because the elected upper house only overlaps with the lower house and hinders the approval of bills. An example is the Landsting case in Denmark (abolished in 1953). Another reason is that the appointed assembly has proven to be ineffective. An example is the case of the Legislative Council in New Zealand (abolished in 1951). Proponents of the one-chamber system note the need for control over government spending and for eliminating the duplicating work of the two chambers. Critics of the one-chamber system point out that the double checks and offsets provided by the two-chamber system can increase the level of consensus on legislative matters. Another drawback of the one-room system is that urban areas with a large population will have more influence than rural areas with a smaller population. The only way to get the less populated areas represented in a unitary government is to implement a two-chamber system (as in the early United States, for example).",

The Vikings and/or Russians may have discovered Svalbard in the 12th century. According to traditional Norse lore, there is a land called Svalbard - literally \"cold edge\". The legally recognized discoverer of the Svalbard Archipelago was Dutchman Willem Barents who explored the islands in 1596. Svalbard served as an international whaling base in the 17th and 18th centuries and the headquarters of several Arctic exploration expeditions. The largest island in the archipelago is Spitsbergen (Jagged peak); this name, although incorrect, is often used to refer to the entire archipelago. According to the Treaty of Svalbard on 9 February 1920, the international community recognized Norway's sovereignty over Svalbard and designated it as a neutral zone (demilitarized). Norway took over administrative Svalbard in 1925. However, according to the contents of the unique agreement, residents of other countries have the right to exploit mineral deposits and other natural resources \"on a footing of absolute equality\"). As a result, a permanent Russian settlement with autonomous status emerged in Barentsburg. In 2000, another Russian settlement in Pyramiden was abandoned. At one time, the Russian (or Soviet) population of Svalbard once outnumbered the Norwegian population.

Thus, theology is a science that studies everything related to religious beliefs or the knowledge of God. Theology includes everything related to God. The term theology refers to the tendency to use a theological point of view in discussing and discussing all human problems. Theologians seek to use analysis and rational arguments to discuss, interpret and teach in any one area of \u200b\u200breligious topics. Theology enables a person to better understand his own religious tradition or other religious traditions, helps make comparisons between various traditions, preserves, renews a particular tradition, helps spread a tradition, applies the sources of a tradition in a current situation or need, or to various other reasons. The word 'theology' comes from the Greek Koine, but gradually acquired a new meaning when the word was adopted in both Greek and Latin forms by Christian writers. Therefore, the use of this word, especially in the West, has a Christian background. However, at present the term can be used for discourse based on reason in the environment or on various religions. Within Christianity itself, the discipline of 'theology' gave birth to its many sub-divisions. In the Christian church, early theology only discussed the teachings about God, then the meaning became broader, namely discussing the entirety of Christian teachings and practices.

Saturn's average density is only 1/8 of Earth's average density, but with a larger volume than Earth's, Saturn's mass is 95 times that of Earth's. Saturn is named after the Greek god of welfare and agriculture; the astronomical symbol (\u2644) represents the scythe used by the god. Saturn's interior most likely consists of a core containing iron, nickel, and rock (compounds of silicon and oxygen). Saturn's core is surrounded by an inner layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and an outer layer of gas. Saturn has a pale yellow hue because of the ammonia crystals that fill its upper atmosphere. The electric current contained in the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to be the generator of Saturn's magnetic field, which is known to be weaker than Earth's magnetic field, but has a magnetic moment 580 times greater than Earth's due to Saturn's larger size. The strength of Saturn's magnetic field is only about 1/20 that of Jupiter's. Although the appearance of the outer atmosphere is ordinary, there is a long-lived appearance that fills this layer of the atmosphere.

Despite not having a solid surface, Saturn is thought to have a solid core. Saturn's shape resembles that of a flat spheroid, a ball that is flattened along its axis from pole to pole so that it bulges around the equator. This shape appears due to Saturn's rotation, which causes the equatorial radius of 60,268 km to be almost 10% larger than the radius of 54,364 km from pole to pole. The other giant planets, Jupiter, Uranus and Neptune also have this shape, but are less obtuse than Saturn. The combination of the rotational speed and the bulge around Saturn's equatorial plane causes a surface gravity of 8.96\u00a0m/s2 at the equator that is 74% higher than surface gravity at the poles and lower than Earth's surface gravity. However, Saturn's escape velocity is nearly 36 km/s, much higher than Earth's escape velocity.

Kakawin is also the most researched. Kakawin, which was written in 1365, was first discovered back in 1894 by J.L.A. Brandes, a Dutch scientist who accompanied the KNIL expedition in Lombok. He saved the contents of the King of Lombok's library in Cakranagara before the king's palace was burned by KNIL soldiers. The title of this kakawin, Nagarakretagama means \"Country with Holy (Religious) Traditions\". The name \"Nagarakretagama\" itself is not mentioned in the kakawin. In pupuh 94/2, Prapanca calls his creation De\u00e7awarnana or descriptions of villages. However, the name given by the author is even forgotten by the public. Until now, Kakawin is commonly referred to as Nagarakretagama. The name Nagarakretagama is listed in the colophon of the manuscript worked on by Dr. J.L.A. Brandes: \"Iti Nagarakretagama Samapta\". Apparently, the name Nagarakretagama was added to the copyist Arthapamasah in the month of Kartika in the year 1662 (October 20, 1740 AD). Nagarakretagama was copied with Balinese script in Kancana. This manuscript was completed in Aswina, Saka year 1287 (September \u2013 October 1365 AD), the author uses the pseudonym Prapanca, based on the results of historical analysis that has been done, it is known that the author of this manuscript is Dang Acarya Nadendra, a former official in Buddhist affairs at the Majapahit palace. He was the son of a palace official in Majapahit with the rank of Dharmadyaksa Kasogatan (Buddhist state official). The author of this script completed the manuscript of the Negarakretagama kakawin in his old age in a hermitage on a mountainside in a village called Kamalasana.",

He reigned from 1350 to 1389 AD, during the peak of the Majapahit empire, one of the largest empires that had ever existed in the archipelago. The most important part of this text, of course, describes the areas of the \"territory\" of the Majapahit kingdom that must pay tribute. Nagarakretagama is written in Old Javanese kakawin (poetry) form. Each kakawin consists of four lines, called pada. Each line consists of eight to 24 syllables, called matra. The kakawin manuscript consists of 98 stanzas, divided into two parts, each of which consists of 49 stanzas. Each stanza consists of one to ten on. From the point of view of the contents, the distribution of the pupuhs has been carried out very neatly. :1 The first part is 49 pupuhs, from cantos 1 to 49, with details::1 The second part is 49 pupuhs, from cantos 50 to 98, with details::1-2 This Kakawin is pujanastra in nature, meaning literary works that flatter and glorify King of Majapahit Hayam Wuruk, as well as the authority of the Majapahit kingdom. However, this work was not compiled at the behest of Hayam Wuruk himself with the aim of self-image politics or power legitimacy. But purely the will of the poet Mpu Prapanca who wanted to give devotion to the crown, and hoped that the King would remember the poet who had served at the Majapahit palace. This means that this manuscript was compiled after Prapanca retired and resigned from the palace. :319-20 The name Prapanca itself is a pen name, a pseudonym to hide the true identity of this literary writer. :287, 317 Because it is literary, only good things are written, things that don't contribute much to the authority of Majapahit, even though the poet might know them, are simply passed over.",

In Sanskrit, the term Bodhisattva consists of two words, namely bodhi which means enlightenment or illumination, and sattwa which means creature. Bodhisattva also refers to the Buddha in his previous life. In Mahayana teachings, Bodhisattvas take a vow not to enter nirvana until all beings have attained Buddhahood. This means that he postponed entering nirvana and chose to descend to earth to sacrifice himself to help other beings achieve enlightenment. That's why Bodhisattvas are known to have compassion and selflessness and self-sacrifice. This is not the same as in the traditional Theravada tradition, beings who attain enlightenment are Arhats, not Buddhas. The Bodhisattva meaning in the Pali Canon (collection of scriptures on Theravada teachings) and Theravada tradition does not say that a Bodhisattva makes a promise not to become enlightened until everyone else is enlightened. This is an innovation from Mahayana. So a Bodhisatta and a Bodhisattva are different things. Bodhisattvas are much admired in famous art, including one of the tallest statues of the Bodhisattva at Puning Monastery in China, built in 1755. The Pali word Bodhisattva is used by the Buddha in the Pali Canon to refer to himself in previous and present lives towards enlightenment and in the period when he was still moving towards liberation. Siddhartha Gautama's life as a Bodhisattva is recorded in the Jataka Book. When Siddhartha Gautama talks about himself first, he uses the term \"when I was a Bodhisattva\". One Bodhisattva who is frequently mentioned in the Pali Canon is Maitreya Buddha, for whom Theravada Teaching does not mention any other Bodhisattva.",

Literally means measurement of the earth. However, the term geometry (more precisely spatial or spatial science) which is the basis for studying geodesy is commonly referred to as a branch of mathematics. According to Helmert and Torge (1880), Geodesy is the science of measuring and mapping the earth's surface which also includes the surface of the seabed. According to the IAG (International Association Of Geodesy, 1979), Geodesy is a scientific discipline that studies the measurement and representation of the Earth and other celestial bodies, including their respective gravitational fields, in three-dimensional space that changes with time. In the report of the United States National Research Council, the definition of Geodesy can be read as follows: a branch of applied mathematics that determines by observations and measurements the exact position of points and the figures and areas of large portions of the earth's surface,the shape and size of the earth, and the variations of terrestrial gravity. In a different language, geodesy is a branch of applied mathematics, which is carried out by making measurements and observations to determine: This definition has two aspects, namely: Now geodetic techniques are no longer only related to surveys and mapping. The development of digital computer technology has expanded the scope of geodetic engineering knowledge and expertise.",

Etymologically, the term empiricism comes from the Greek emperia, which means experience. In empiricism, truth can only be obtained through experience. The empiricist mindset relies on empirical evidence. Empiricism is a type of ontology. In empiricism, humans can gain knowledge from experience by observing and sensing. Empiricism is one of the three schools of philosophy of science in the Western world. Philosophical thinking on empiricism has a nature that is contrary to rationalism. Empiricism thought was pioneered by Thomas Hobbes as a reaction against rationalism. The development of empiricism thought took place rapidly in England and the surrounding area during the renaissance during the 17th to 18th centuries. Empiricism was first developed in England by John Locke (1632\u20131704), but has more influenced thinkers in the United States, especially in the fields of environmental preservation and environmental psychology. Supporting figures come from adherents of Western philosophy, including Francis Bacon, Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, and David Hume. The empiricism of its leaders has contributed to the development of the scientific field. These figures include John Locke (social science and scientific method), George Berkeley (physics, mathematics and theology), and David Hume (historical science and science). Empiricism is also the basis for the development of philosophy in positivism. In addition, empiricism is also one of the main streams in educational philosophy which is the basis for the development of various models of education in the world. The understanding of empiricism has been put forward by Aristotle with the opinion that perception is the basis of science. Empiricism first appeared in England as a thought that contradicted the rationalist thought put forward by Ren\u00e9 Descartes.",

The laws of mechanism are considered as the basis of the processes that take place in the world, including humans. Then, another idea about empiricism was put forward by John Locke (1632\u20131704) who argued that the source of knowledge received by reason comes from experience. The empiricism of thought was further developed by George Berkeley who argued that material substances do not exist at all, only observable characteristics exist. When the world entered the Industrial Revolution, humans began to rely on science and technology to determine policies to address various social problems in society. Mysticism and beliefs about the occult and magic have begun to be abandoned by society. Social problems began to be solved by compiling and testing various scientific theories. The benchmarks used are empiricism and the scientific method. The main teachings of empiricism can be divided based on their views on sources of knowledge, methods of thinking and models of reasoning used. The source of knowledge in the view of empiricism is only from experience. The method of thinking he uses is through empirical evidence and experiments. While the reasoning model he uses is inductive reasoning. The main teachings of empiricism are contrary to rationalism, because rationalism considers knowledge recognition by the senses to be unclear. Meanwhile, empiricism believes that the senses are the perfect and clearest means of recognizing knowledge. In another sense, empiricism prioritizes the use of a posteriori elements, while rationalism prioritizes the use of a priori elements. Another difference between empiricism and rationalism lies in the type of mindset used. Empiricism uses an inductive mindset, while rationalism uses a deductive mindset. The epistemological view of empiricism is based on the principle that everything that exists in the mind exists in the form of sensory data.",

Medicine includes the various health care practices developed to maintain and restore health by preventing and treating disease. Contemporary medicine uses biomedical science, biomedical research, genetics, and medical technology to diagnose, treat, and prevent injuries and disease, usually through drugs or surgery, but also through a variety of therapies, including psychotherapy, external splints and traction, among others. medical devices, biopharmaceuticals, and radiotherapy. Medicine has been around for thousands of years, much of this time being practiced as an art (an area of \u200b\u200bskill and knowledge) and often linked to religious beliefs and local cultural philosophies. For example, a shaman would use medicinal plants and pray for healing or ancient philosophers and doctors would bleed according to the theory of humoralism. In recent centuries, since the advent of modern science, most medical practices have been a combination of art and science (both basic and applied sciences, under the medical umbrella). Meanwhile, the technique of performing sutures is an art that is learned through practice and knowledge of what happens at the cellular and molecular level in the sutured tissue emerges through science. The pre-scientific forms of medicine are now known as traditional medicine and folk medicine. They remain so commonly used with or in lieu of scientific medicine that they are called alternative medicine. Meanwhile, treatment outside the limits of safety and efficacy according to medical science is called quackery. The practice of medicine is carried out by medical professionals, usually doctors, and other medical professional groups which include nurses or pharmacists.

Medical science is generally considered to have various specialist branches, ranging from pediatrics (child health), gynecology (women's disease), neurology (neurology), to cover other fields such as sports medicine, and public health. Systems of medicine and health care practices have developed in various human societies since at least the beginning of human recorded history. These systems have developed in different ways, in different cultures, and in different areas. What is meant by modern medical science in general is the medical tradition that has developed in the Western world since the beginning of modern times. Despite this, various traditional medical and health procedures are still practiced throughout the world, largely considered separate and distinct from Western medicine, which is also called biomedicine or the Hippocratic tradition. The most developed system of medical science apart from the Western system is the Ayurvedic tradition from India and traditional Chinese medicine. Various unconventional health care traditions were also developed in the Western world that are different from medical science in general. In many places, Western systems of medicine are often practiced alongside traditional local or other systems of medicine, although these are also considered to be in competition or even conflict. Veterinary medicine or what is commonly called veterinary medicine is a health practice that is specific to animal species and is a medical science other than for humans.

Many of the early Rus' principalities were nearly destroyed or severely affected by the great Mongol invasion in the 13th century, but the lands of modern Belarus were spared the brunt of the invasions and eventually joined the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. During this time, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania engaged in several military campaigns, including fighting on the Polish side against the Teutonic Order at the Battle of Grunwald in 1410; mutual victory allowed the Grand Duchy to control the northwestern borders of Eastern Europe. The Muscovites, led by Ivan III of Moscow, began a military campaign in 1486 in an attempt to annex the former lands of Kievan Rus', specifically the territories of modern Belarus, Russia and Ukraine. On 2 February 1386, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland were joined in a personal union by the marriage of their rulers.

The study of devices like this is a branch of physics, while the design and manufacture of electronic circuits is part of electrical engineering, computer engineering, and electronics and instrumentation science/engineering. Tools that use the basic work of electronics are referred to as electronic equipment (electronic devices). Examples of these electronic equipment (devices): Cathode Ray Tubes, radios, TVs, cassette recorders, video cassette recorders (VCRs), VCD recorders, DVD recorders, video cameras, digital cameras, desktop personal computers, laptop computers, PDAs (pocket computers) , robots, smart cards, etc. The history of electronics begins in the 18th century, involving three main components, namely vacuum tubes, transistors and integrated circuits. In 1883, Thomas Alva Edison discovered that electrons could move from one conductor to another through a vacuum. This discovery of conduction or displacement is known as the Edison effect. In 1904, John Fleming applied the Edison effect to invent a two-element electron tube known as a diode, and Lee De Forest followed in 1906 with a three-element tube, called a triode. The vacuum tube is a device made to manipulate the possibility of electrical energy so that it can be amplified and sent. The first application of the electron tube was in the field of radio communications. Guglielmo Marconi pioneered the development of the wireless telegraph in 1896 and long-distance radio communication in 1901. In 1918, Edwin Armstrong invented the \"super-heterodyne\" receiver which could select radio signals or stations and could receive signals over long distances.",

When electronic systems became the guarantee of quality, Bell Labs engineers introduced the cathode-ray picture tube and color television. But Vladimir Zworykin, an engineer at the Radio Corporation of America (RCA), is considered the \"father of television\" for his inventions, the picture tube and camera tube iconoscope. By the mid-1950s, television had superseded radio for home and entertainment use. After the war, electron tubes were used to develop the first computers, but these tubes were impractical due to the size of the electronic components. In 1947, the transistor was invented by a team of engineers from Bell Laboratories. The transistor functions like a vacuum tube, but is smaller, lighter, consumes less power, and is more robust, and less expensive to manufacture due to its combination of metal connectors and semiconductor materials. The concept of the integrated circuit was proposed in 1952 by Geoffrey W. A. \u200b\u200bDummer, a British electronics expert with his Royal Radar Establishment.

Sociology has a clear object of study and can be investigated through scientific methods and can be structured into a coherent and interconnected system. The main object of study in sociology is the structure of society, social elements, socialization and social change. The branches of sociology are a combination of the science of social phenomena that occur in society with other sciences. Sociology was founded by the ancient Greeks. Initially, sociology was united with social philosophy. Separated because then community discussion revolves around matters that attract public attention. Such as war and social conflict.

Under such conditions, Auguste Comte suggested that the study of society should be developed into an independent science. C tis where sociology was born as the youngest branch of the social sciences. The term sociology was popularized by Auguste Comte in his Cours de Philosophe Positive (1830). In the book it is explained that the object of sociology is human or society at large. Sociology then became a science that developed in Europe, especially in Germany and France. In the process of its development, sociology can be separated from other social sciences such as economics and history. Sociology, which is a thought against society, is slow to become a science that stands alone. Many efforts, both scientific and non-scientific, have shaped sociology as an independent science. The main motivating factor for the emergence of sociology is the increasing attention to the welfare of society and the changes that occur in it. At first, humans united all fields of knowledge as part of natural philosophy. Then natural philosophy developed into various branches of science, one of which is social philosophy. Social philosophy discusses the ethics that need to exist and be applied in society. Its characters are Plato (429-347 BC) and Aristotle (384-322 BC). Plato discussed the elements of sociology in the state, while Aristotle discussed social ethics. In its development, sociology became a knowledge that was different from social philosophy.

They broke away from the majority of the Mah\u0101s\u0101\u1e43ghikas at the time of the Second Buddhist Council. The Sthavira nik\u0101ya (Sanskrit \"Sect of the Elders\"; Traditional Chinese: \u4e0a\u5ea7\u90e8; pinyin: Sh\u00e0ngzu\u00f2 B\u00f9) is one of the early Buddhist schools. The Sthavira nik\u0101ya broke away from the majority of the Mah\u0101s\u0101\u1e43ghikas at the time of the Second Buddhist Council resulting in the first schism in the Sangha. The \u015a\u0101riputraparip\u1e5bcch\u0101 Mah\u0101s\u0101\u1e43ghika, a text written to give reasons for the school's deviation from the disciplinary code of the senior monks, asserts that the council met in P\u0101\u1e6daliputra on the question of the vinaya, and it explains that the split occurred because the majority (Mah\u0101sa\u1e43gha) refused to accept additions to the Vinaya rules by minority (Sthavira). The Mah\u0101s\u0101\u1e43ghika, therefore, saw the Sthavira as a breakaway group trying to change the original Vinaya. Scholars generally agree that the matter of dispute is indeed a matter of the vinaya, and have noted that this Mah\u0101s\u0101\u1e43ghika account is supported by the vinaya texts themselves, since the vinayas associated with the Sthavira contain more rules than those in the Mah\u0101s\u0101\u1e43ghika Vinaya. Therefore, modern scholarship generally agrees that the Mah\u0101s\u0101\u1e43ghika Vinaya is the oldest. According to Skilton, future scholars might determine that a study of the Mah\u0101s\u0101\u1e43ghika school would contribute to a better understanding of the early Dhamma-Vinaya than the Theravada school. The Tibetan historian Buton Rinchen Drub (1290-1364) writes that Mah\u0101s\u0101\u1e43ghika used Prakrit, Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101din used Sanskrit, Sthavira used Pai\u015b\u0101c\u012b, and Sa\u1e43mit\u012bya used Apabhra\u1e43\u015ba. The Sthavira later divided into other schools such as: The Vibhajyav\u0101da branch gave rise to a number of schools such as: The Theravada School in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia has identified itself exclusively with the Sthavira, for the Pali word thera is equivalent to the Sanskrit sthavira.",

Before Thales, Greek thought was dominated by mythological ways of thinking in explaining everything. The thought of Thales is considered the first philosophic activity and is called the father of philosophy. Because it tries to explain the world and the phenomena in it without relying on myths but on human ratios. He is also known as one of the Seven Wise Men (in Greek hoi hepta sophoi), whom Aristotle called 'the first philosopher'. Apart from being a philosopher, Thales is also known as an expert in geometry, astronomy, and politics. Together with Anaximander and Anaximenes, Thales belongs to the Miletus School. Thales did not leave written evidence regarding his philosophical thought. Thales's thoughts are mainly obtained through Aristotle's writings about him. Aristotle said that Thales was the first person to think about the origin of the universe. For this reason, Thales is also considered a pioneer of natural philosophy (natural philosophy). Thales (624-546 BC) was born in the city of Miletus which was the land of the Greeks in Asia Minor. Miletos' affluent situation allowed the people there to pass the time discussing and thinking about things. It was the beginning of philosophical activity so it is not surprising that the first Greek philosophers were born in this place. Thales was a merchant who often sailed to Egypt. In Egypt, Thales studied geometry and brought it to Greece. He is said to be able to measure the pyramid from its shadow alone. In addition, he can also measure the distance of ships in the sea from the coast. Then Thales became famous after successfully predicting the occurrence of a solar eclipse on May 28, 585 BC. Thales was able to make this prediction because he studied astronomical records stored in Babylon since 747 BC.",

Thales stated that water is the basic principle (in Greek arche) of all things. Water is the base, principal, and foundation of everything in the universe. Thanks to its own creative power and power, without any external causes, water is able to appear in all forms, is steady and imperishable. According to Thales, water is the source of life. Thales' argument for this view is how all living things' food ingredients contain water and how all living things also need water to live. In addition, water is a substance that can change state (solid, liquid, and gas) without decreasing. In addition, he also put forward the view that the earth is located above the water. Earth is seen as a material that once came out of the sea and then floated on it. Thales believed that everything in the universe has a soul. The soul is not only found in living things but also in dead things. This theory of animate matter is called hylezoism. Thales' argument was based on a magnet which was said to have a body and soul because it was able to move iron. In geometry, Thales is known for contributing what is called the theorem of Thales, although not necessarily entirely his original ideas. Thales' theorem contains the following: Based on the record of Herodotus, Thales once gave advice to the Ionian people who were being threatened by attacks from the Persian Empire in the mid-6th century BC. Thales advised the Ionians to form a common administrative and administrative center in the city of Teos which had a central position in all of Ionia.",

Homeomorphism is an isomorphism in a topological space category. Two topological spaces with a homeomorphism between them are called homeomorphic. The word homeomorphism comes from the Greek words \u1f45\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 (homoios) = similar or the same and \u03bc\u03bf\u03c1\u03c6\u03ae (morph\u0113) = shape, shape, introduced to mathematics by Henri Poincar\u00e9 in 1895. Roughly speaking, a topological space is a geometric object, with homeomorphism it is continuous bending and stretching to a new shape. Thus, the square and the circle are homeomorphic to each other, but not to the spherical shell and torus. However, this description can be misleading. Some malar deformations are not a homeomorphism, for example the curvature of a line into a point. Some homeomorphisms are not constant deformations, for example the homeomorphism between trefoil vertices and circles. One of the most repeated math jokes is that a topologist cannot tell the difference between a coffee cup and a donut, because a fairly soft donut can be shaped into a coffee cup by creating a depression which is then enlarged while keeping the donut hole the size of the cup handle. A function f:X\u2192Y{\\displaystyle f:X\\to Y} between two topological spaces (X,TX){\\displaystyle (X,{\\mathcal {T}}_{X})} and (Y,TY ){\\displaystyle (Y,{\\mathcal {T}}_{Y})} is called a homeomorphism if it has the following properties: A function with these three properties is also called dicontinuous.

Although there is no direct single word translation for dharma in European languages, dharma is generally translated as \"righteousness\", \"merit\" or \"religious and moral obligations\" that govern individual behavior. Dharma is often equated with a particular religion/belief, but the term religion/belief is actually different from Dharma. In Hinduism, dharma is one of the four components of the Puru\u1e63\u0101rtha, the goal of life, and denotes conduct deemed appropriate to the order that makes life and the universe possible. These include duties, rights, laws, conduct, virtues and \"right way of life\". In Buddhism, dharma means \"cosmic law and order\", as expressed by Buddhist teachings. In Buddhist philosophy, dhamma/dharma is also a term for \"phenomenon\".

Bacteria were one of the first forms of life to appear and currently inhabit the majority of habitats on Earth. Bacteria can live in soil, water, acidic hot springs, radioactive waste, to the Earth's crust. Bacteria also establish symbiotic relationships with plants and animals. Most of the bacteria are unknown, and only about 27 percent of the bacterial phyla have species that can be grown in the laboratory. The study of bacteria is called bacteriology, a branch of microbiology. Almost all animals depend on bacteria for their survival because only bacteria and some archaea have the genes and enzymes necessary to synthesize vitamin B12. This vitamin is obtained by animals through the food chain or produced by microorganisms that live in their digestive system. There are about 40 million bacterial cells in one gram of soil and one million bacterial cells in one milliliter of fresh water. Altogether, there are about 4\u20136 x 1030 bacteria and archaea on Earth, which form a biomass surpassed only by plants.

Geomorphologists try to understand why a landscape looks the way it does, to understand the history and dynamics of the landscape, and predict future changes using a combination of field observations, experiments and modelling. Geomorphology is studied in geography, geology, geodesy, archeology and earth engineering. Geomorphology had become a scientific discipline before the 17th century AD. In the 19th century, geomorphology began to be applied to developing countries. In the 20th century AD, geomorphology experienced rapid development in the Western world (Europe and America). Basically the scope of study of geomorphology is the shape of the Earth's surface. In scientific discussions, the shape of the Earth's surface includes the discovery and identification of land forms and their forming factors. Geomorphology also discusses the history and origins of land forms. In addition, geomorphology also discusses the discovery and recognition of landscape-forming aspects of constructional and destructive landscapes. Geomorphology determines the object of study is the shape of the land. Therefore, the study aspects of geomorphology can be divided into 4, namely morphology, morphogenesis, morphochronology, and morphoarrangement. Morphology deals with issues of shape and origin of the Earth's surface. The discussion is divided into two into morphography and morphometry. Morphography provides a descriptive explanation with descriptions, while morphometrics provides a quantitative explanation through measurement. Morphogenesis discusses the morphological processes that cause changes in land forms. The discussion is carried out on the process of change in the short term as well as in the long term.

Types of exogenous forces include weathering, erosion, mass wasting and sedimentation. Constructional landscapes are also known as endogenic landforms. The formation of destructive landscapes is controlled by ecdogenous forces. Endogenous forces include all types of forces originating from the Earth. In general, endogenous forces include tectonic activity, magmatic activity and volcanic activity. Tectonic activity is caused by plate shifts and the formation of mountains.

The term tungsten comes from the Swedish tung sten, meaning heavy stone. Its name in Swedish is volfram, but to differentiate it from scheelit, it is given the alternative name tungsten in Swedish. Natural tungsten is found on earth almost always as a chemical compound. It is a rare metal that is hard at standard conditions when not combined. It was identified as a new element in 1781, and first isolated in 1783. Important tungsten ores include wolframite and scheelite. Its free elemental resistance is remarkable, especially the fact that it has the highest melting point of all the elements discovered. It melts at 3,422\u00b0C (6,192\u00b0F). Its high density is up to 19.3 times that of water, comparable to uranium and gold, and higher (about 1.7 times) than lead. Polycrystalline tungsten is a brittle and hard material, making it difficult to work with. However, pure single-crystalline tungsten is more ductile, and can be cut using a hard steel saw. Many tungsten alloys have a variety of applications, including incandescent lamp filaments, X-ray tubes (both as filaments and targets), electrodes in WIG welding, superalloys, vacuum tubes, and radiation shielding. The hardness and high density of tungsten provide it with military applications in penetrating projectiles. Tungsten compounds are also often used as industrial catalysts.

When made very pure, tungsten retains its hardness (which exceeds that of most steels), and becomes malleable enough to be easily machined. It is processed by forging, drawing, or extrusion. Tungsten objects are also commonly formed by sintering. Of all the metals in its pure form, tungsten has the highest melting point (3,422\u00b0C (6,192\u00b0F)), lowest vapor pressure (at temperatures above 1,650\u00b0C (3,000\u00b0F)) and highest tensile strength. Although carbon remains solid at higher temperatures than tungsten, it sublimes at atmospheric pressure rather than melting, and so has no melting point. Tungsten has the lowest coefficient of thermal expansion of any pure metal. The low thermal expansion and high melting point and tensile strength of tungsten stem from the strong covalent bonds formed between the tungsten atoms by the 5d electrons. Alloying small amounts of tungsten with steel greatly increases its toughness. Tungsten exists in two main crystalline forms: \u03b1 and \u03b2. The first form has a body-centered cubic structure and is a more stable form. The \u03b2-phase structure is called cubic A15; it is metastable, but may coexist with the \u03b1 phase under ambient conditions due to synthesis or non-equilibrium stabilization by impurities. In contrast to the \u03b1 phase which crystallizes in isometric grains, the \u03b2 form exhibits a columnar stature. The \u03b1 phase has one third the electrical resistivity and a much lower TC superconducting transition temperature than the \u03b2 phase: ca. 0.015 K vs 1-4 K; mixing the two phases allows obtaining intermediate TC values. The TC value can also be increased by alloying tungsten with other metals (eg 7.9 K for W-Tc). Such tungsten alloys are sometimes used in low temperature superconducting circuits.",

In his writings, he actually criticized and denounced famous philosophers and figures, such as Homer, Archylochus, Hesiodos, Pythagoras, Xenophanes, and Hecataeus. Even though he turned away from the common philosophical teachings of his time, that does not mean that he was completely uninfluenced by those philosophers. Herakleitos is known to have written one book, but it has been lost. Until now, only 130 fragments have been stored, consisting of short proverbs, the meaning of which is often unclear. His philosophical thoughts are not easy to understand, so he is nicknamed \"the dark one\" (in English, the obscure). Herakleitos is known to have come from Ephesus in Asia Minor. He lived around the 5th century BC (about 540-480 BC). The account of Diogenes Laertius also states that Herakleitos was born around 540 BC into an aristocratic family in Ephesus, but later abandoned political life and devoted the rights of power he bequeathed to his brother. Herakleitos was a contemporary of Pythagoras and Xenophanes, but he was younger than both of them. However, Herakleitos was older than Parmenides because he was criticized by the philosopher. Apart from coming from a respectable family in Ephesus, there is no other credible information about the life history of Herakleitos considering that almost all sources regarding his life are anecdotes that are not authentic, imagined or made up by the author of the anecdotes based on Herakleitos' thoughts. No source mentions that he ever left his hometown, which was at that time part of the Persian empire.",

        "paragraph": "If you look at the works he left behind, it appears that Herakleitos' character was arrogant and haughty. Apart from criticizing the above philosophers, he also looked down on the ignorant people and insisted that most humans were bad. In addition, he also cursed the citizens of Ephesus. The most famous thought of Herakleitos is that of changes in the universe. According to Herakleitos, nothing in the universe is permanent or permanent. Nothing really exists, everything is in the process of becoming. He is famous for saying panta rhei kai uden mei which means, \"everything flows and nothing stays constant.\" Herakleitos envisioned this unceasing change in two ways: Everything that is constantly changing in the universe can operate in an orderly manner because of the logos. The view of logos here should not be equated with the concept of logos in the Stoic school. Logos is the ratio that becomes the law that controls everything and moves everything, including humans. Logos is also understood as something material, but at the same time transcends ordinary matter. This is because at that time, there were no philosophers who were able to separate the spiritual from the material. According to Herakleitos, every thing is composed of opposites. Nevertheless, in the resistance there is still unity. In short, it can be said that 'the one is many and the many is one.' Anaximenes also held this view, but the difference with Herakleitos was that Anaximenes said the conflict was injustice, while Herakleitos stated that the conflict was the principle of justice. We will not be able to know what 'day' is without us knowing what 'night' is. We will not know what 'life' is without the reality of 'death'.",

The actinide group elements are radioactive, with only actinium, thorium, and uranium found naturally in the Earth's crust. The actinide group of elements, which can also be called actinoida or actinone, consists of fifteen elements. The atomic spectra of these heavy elements are very complex, and it is difficult to characterize the levels in the quantum numbers and their configurations. The -ide suffix is \u200b\u200bused to refer to anions (eg halide ions and oxides), the -on suffix is \u200b\u200bchosen to refer to non-metals (such as the noble gas groups). This group of elements is metallic, so it is now recommended to use the \u2013oid ending. The actinoide group of elements is in the last row under the body of the periodic table which was first proposed by Glenn Seaborg (1944). The 5f electron filling of actinoides is similar to that of lanthanoids, their chemical properties are not uniform and each element has unique properties. All actinoide metals are radioactive, highly toxic, and have half-lives that decrease dramatically with increasing atomic number. The main feature of the actinoide elements is that they are all electropositive metals. This actinoide metal has a fairly high density (15-20 g cm\u22121), high melting point (~1000 \u00b0C) and very high boiling point (~3000 \u00b0C). In addition, the actinoide metals are not as reactive as the lanthanide metals. Actinides have 15 elements, i.e. The actinoide elements are capable of forming oxidation states. Thus, actinoides lose 6dx 7s2 electrons, but some metals (Ac, Th, Pa, and U) are capable of removing 5f electrons thereby achieving the noble gas electronic configuration Rn].",

For example: Western society sees time as a straight line (linear). The straight-line concept of time is followed by the formation of the concept of sequence of events. In other words, human history is seen as a process of travel in a timeline from the past, present, and future. In contrast to Western society, Hindu society sees time as a cycle that continues without end. The way of looking at time is not just a way of looking at the ticking of a watch on the wall that keeps on rotating without stopping and waiting for orders from everyone, but time is more seen as an opportunity, money, and work that continues to carve out an endless life. Freedom of time occurs where people are able to provide all their creations, creations, and initiatives for all. To measure very fast time scales (in the world of electronics and semiconductors), most people use units: In the world of physics, the dimensions of time and space (length, area, and volume) are the fundamental units of measurement, as is the mass of an object. objects (time, length and mass).

Unfortunately, in June 1316 at Vincennes, Val-de-Marne, and after one particularly grueling game, Louis drank a large quantity of chilled wine and later died of pneumonia or pleurisy, although poisoning is also suspected. Because of his death, Louis X became the first tennis player whose name is recorded in history. Racquets came into use in the 16th century and the game began to be called \"tennis\", from the Old French term tenez, which could mean \"hold!\", \"receive!\", or \"take!\", an interjection used by The player serving is aimed at his opponent. The game was popular in England and France, although the game was only played indoors and the ball could occasionally go over the wall. It was only in the 19th century that tennis was revived by British aristocrats by building country club facilities or tennis courts in their big houses. Because at that time tennis was popularly played on lawns, it was known as 'Lawn Tennis' or grass court tennis.

Zirconium metal is used in nuclear reactor cores because it is corrosion resistant and does not absorb neutrons. Zircaloy is an aliase of zirconium which is important for nuclear adsorption, such as coating fuel components. Zirconium is abundant in minerals such as zircon and baddelyite. Baddeleyit itself is a zirconium oxide that is resistant to extremely high temperatures, so it is used for furnace linings. Zirconium is an element in nature that is resistant to high temperatures. Zirconium does not exist in free form in nature but in the form of zirconium silicate in zircon (ZrSiO4) and zirconium oxide in badelleyite (ZrO2). Zirconium is found in volcanic rocks, basalt and granite rocks. The mineral baddeleyit or ZrO2 is a natural form of zirconium dioxide. The crystals have a density between 5.4 \u2013 6.02 and a hardness of 6.5 on the mesh scale containing 80% \u2013 90% zirconium dioxide. Zirconium is found in many zircon minerals varying from 61% - 67%. Theoretically zirconium in normal silicates is 67.2%.

Commonly added metals include chromium (Cr), iron (Fe), nickel (Ni), tin (Sn), and copper (Cu). Zirconium is widely used in the High-tech industry due to its favorable mechanical, thermal, electrical, chemical and optical properties. This element is widely used in the production of ceramics and in nuclear reactors as a coating for nuclear fuel. Zirconium is also used to manufacture pumps, valves and heat exchangers. Due to its fire resistance properties, zirconium is often used as the main composition of armament equipment, fuse boxes, and is present in vacuum-opening pyrophoric bullets, as well as laser excitation in photography. The application of pure zirconium alloys, such as alloying them with niobium to produce a superconductor, alloying them with titanium is used in aircraft, and combining them with copper improves the properties of the zirconium. Due to its resistance to corrosion, zircon metal is used as an additive in pumps, faucets, pipes, heat exchangers and chemical tanks, especially sulfuric acid and hydrochloric acid. The use of zirconum metal is also used by factories producing urea, hydrogen peroxide, methyl methacryrate and acetic acid. Zirconium is a material that has a very strategic role in various industries because of its advantages compared to other materials.

Leaves are important organs for plants to sustain their life because plants are obligate autotrophic organisms, they must supply their own energy needs through the conversion of sunlight energy into chemical energy. A perfect leaf is composed of three parts: the midrib, petiolus and leaf blade. The leaf sheath places the leaves on the stem. The petiole connects the sheath or stem to the leaf blade. The leaf blade is the most important part of most leaves because this is where the main function of the leaf as a photosynthetic organ is most dominant. The shape of the leaf blade is very diverse, but usually in the form of strands, can be thin or thick. The two-dimensional image of the leaf is used as a differentiator for leaf shapes. The basic shape of the leaf is rounded, with variations in the finger lobes or being elliptical and elongated. The extreme shape can be long tapered. Assorted leaf ornaments. The surface of the leaves can be covered with small hairs. Between the base of the leaf or petiole is often decorated with supporting leaves. On the leaves of grasses, the borders of the strands and the midrib are often decorated with ligulas. Leaves can also be modified into thorns (for example in cacti) and result in the leaves losing their function as photosynthetic organs. Leaves of succulent plants or xerophytes can also experience a change in function to become water storage organs. The green color of the leaves comes from the chlorophyll content of the leaves.

During the first and fifth centuries AD, Bantu-speaking tribes migrated from the far north and west to occupy the region. Then the Swahili tribes, and then the Arabs, established maritime trade along the coast until the arrival of Europeans. Vasco da Gama explored this area in 1498 and eventually this area became a colony of Portugal starting in 1505. After four centuries of Portuguese colonization, Mozambique gained its independence in 1975, and declared itself the People's Republic of Mozambique, in which the Communist regime ruled the country. until the late 1990s. After two years of independence, a protracted civil war broke out from 1977 to 1992. In 1994, Mozambique held its first elections with multiparty participation and achieved political stability thereafter.

In the central part of Mozambique, the Portuguese attempted to legitimize and consolidate their trading and settlement position through the creation of prazos (land grants) associated with their settlement and administration. While prazos were originally developed to be held by the Portuguese, through intermarriage they became African Portuguese or African Indian centers defended by a large army of African slaves known as Chikunda. Historically in Mozambique there was slavery.

As such, it is one of the four basic states of matter (the others being solid, gas, and plasma), and is the only state with a definite volume but no fixed shape. Liquids consist of particles of matter with fine vibrations, such as atoms, held together by intermolecular forces. Water is, by far, the most common liquid on Earth. Like gases, liquids can flow and take the shape of their container. Most liquids are incompressible, although others are compressible. Unlike gases, liquids do not spread to fill every space of the container, and maintain a fairly constant density. A characteristic property of the liquid state is surface tension, which leads to the wetting phenomenon. The density of liquids is usually close to that of solids, and much higher than that of gases. Therefore, liquid and solid are both called condensed matter. On the other hand, since liquids and gases share the ability to flow, they are both called fluids. Although water is abundant on Earth, this state of matter is actually the least common in the known universe, because the existence of liquid requires a relatively narrow temperature/pressure range. Most known matter in the universe exists in the gaseous state (with detectable traces of dense matter) as interstellar clouds or in the plasma form within stars. Liquid is one of the four main states of matter, along with solid, gas and plasma. Fluid is fluid. Unlike solids, molecules in liquids have much greater freedom of movement.

It has a nearly constant volume over a wide pressure range; it does not expand to fill the empty space in a container but forms its own surface, and does not always mix easily with other liquids. This property makes the fluid suitable for applications such as hydraulics. The liquid particles are held together tightly but not rigidly. They are able to move freely, resulting in a limited degree of particle mobility. As the temperature increases, the molecular vibrations increase causing the distance between molecules to increase. When the liquid reaches its boiling point, the cohesive forces holding the molecules together are broken, and the liquid turns into a gas (unless superheating occurs). If the temperature drops, the distance between the molecules gets closer and closer. When a liquid reaches its freezing point, the molecules usually lock together into a specific order, which is called crystallization, and the bonds between them become more rigid, turning the liquid into its solid state (unless supercooling occurs). There are only two elements that are liquids at standard temperature and pressure: mercury and bromine. Four other elements have melting points just above room temperature: francium, cesium, gallium and rubidium. Metal alloys that are liquid at room temperature include NaK, sodium-potassium alloys, galinstan, and some amalgams (alloys involving mercury).

Histological activities are carried out on thinly sliced \u200b\u200btissue preparations. Histology is very useful in studying the physiological functions of cells in the body, both humans, animals and plants, and in the form of histopathology it is useful in diagnosing diseases involving changes in physiological functions and organ deformation. For example, in medicine, the presence of a tumor requires the results of a tissue sample. In agriculture, examination of the condition of the transport network can support the diagnosis of tobacco leaf blight. Histology greatly requires the use of microscopy as well as the technique of providing tissue samples. The method of making histological preparations is called microtechnics. Making preparations from a tissue begins with surgery, biopsy, or autopsy. The extracted tissue is then processed with a fixative which will prevent the preparation from being damaged (shifted in position, rotted, or damaged). The most commonly used fixative for animal (including human) tissues is formalin (10% formaldehyde dissolved in water). Bouin's solution can also be used as an alternative fixative although the results will not be as good as formalin because it will leave yellow marks and artifacts. Artifacts are objects that are not present in the original tissue, but appear in the final preparation. This artifact was formed due to imperfect preparations. The fixed tissue sample is immersed in a graded ethanol (alcohol) liquid for the process of removing water from the tissue (dehydration). Then the sample was transferred into toluene to remove alcohol (dealcoholization). The final step is to place the tissue sample in hot paraffin which infiltrates the tissue. During this process which lasts for 12-16 hours, the tissue that was initially soft will become hard so that it is easier to cut using a microtome.",

In flowers there are reproductive organs, namely stamens and pistils. Flowers can appear singly or together in a series. Flowers that appear together are known as compound interest or inflorescence. In some species, compound interest can be considered ordinary as a (single) flower, for example in Anthurium and sunflower. The floral units that make up compound interest are called florets. Botanically, the flower is the part of the plant that produces seeds. Pollination and fertilization take place in flowers. After fertilization, the flower will develop further to form the fruit. In flowering plants, the fruit is a structure that carries and protects the seeds. The biological function of flowers is the sexual organ, as a vessel for the union of male (microspores) and female (macrospores) gametes to produce seeds. That flowers are analogous to sexual organs in animals was only scientifically realized in the 17th century in Europe. Some flowers have bright colors that function as pollinator animal decoys. Some other flowers produce heat or a distinctive aroma, also aimed at luring animals to help pollinate. Flowers can also be considered as organs to survive in unfavorable conditions for growth. A number of plants will immediately form flowers if they experience a lack of water or low temperatures. The best known example is the Bougainvillea paper flower. Flowers reduce metabolism and if the plant dies, seeds are expected to have formed as a survival effort. Humans have long been fascinated by flowers, especially the colorful ones that have cultural significance. Flowers are one of the determinants of the value of a plant as an ornamental plant.",

Flower formation is tightly controlled genetically and in many species is induced by certain environmental changes, such as low temperature, long exposure to light, and availability of water (see section Flowers: Flower formation). Flowers are almost always symmetrical in shape, which can often be used as an identifier for a taxon. There are two flower shapes based on their shape symmetry: actinomorphic (\"star-shaped\", radial symmetry) and zygomorphic (mirror symmetry). The actinomorphic form is more common. A flower is called a perfect flower if it has male organs (stamens) and female organs (pistils) together in one organ. Such flowers are called pansy or hermaphrodite flowers. A flower is said to be a complete flower if it has all the main parts of the flower. The four main parts of a flower (from outside to inside) are as follows: The female reproductive organ is the fruit leaf or carpellum at the base of which there is an ovary (ovary) with one or a number of ovule (ovulum, plural ovules) which carry female gametes) inside embryo sac. At the tip of the pistil there is a stigma or stigma to receive pollen or pollen. The pistil or stylus serves as a pathway for the pollen to the ovary. Although the floral structure described above is said to be a \"common\" plant structure, plant species exhibit highly variable modifications. This modification is used by botanists to make connections between plants with one another. For example, the two subclasses of flowering plants are distinguished by the number of floral organs: dicot plants generally have 4 or 5 organs (or in multiples of 4 or 5) whereas monocot plants have three organs or multiples thereof.",

Both in its original form and in its evolution in the second half of the 20th century, Cybernetics is equally applicable to physical and (language-based) social systems. Template:Cybernetics Science is most applicable when the system to be analyzed is involved in a closed loop signal; that is, when the action of the system causes some change in its environment and that change feeds into the system through information (feedback) that causes the system to adapt to these new conditions: the change in the system affects its behavior. This \"cause-and-effect\" relationship is necessary and sufficient for a cybernetics perspective. Systems dynamics, a related field, began with the application of electrical engineering control theory to other types of simulation models (particularly business systems) by Jay Forrester at MIT in the 1950s. Contemporary cybernetics began as an interdisciplinary study linking the fields of control systems, circuit theory, mechanical engineering, modeling logic, evolutionary biology, neuroscience, anthropology, and psychology in the 1940s, often associated with the Macy's Conference. Other fields of study that have influenced or been influenced by cybernetics include game theory, systems theory (a mathematical counterpart to cybernetics), perceptual control theory, sociology, psychology (especially neuropsychology, behavioral psychology, cognitive psychology), philosophy, architecture and organizational theory.

First used by the philosopher Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten in 1735 for the notion of the science of things that can be felt through feelings. Even though initially something beautiful is judged from a technical aspect in forming a work, changes in the mindset of society will also influence the assessment of beauty. For example, at the time of romanticism in France, beauty meant the ability to present a majesty. In the era of realism, beauty meant the ability to present something as it is. At the time of de Stijl's rise in the Netherlands, beauty meant the ability to combine color and space and the ability to abstract objects. Further developments made him realize that beauty does not always have a certain formula. It develops according to the public's acceptance of the ideas raised by the creator of the work. That's why there are always two things known in the assessment of beauty, namely the beauty, a work that is recognized by many parties to meet the standards of beauty, and the ugly, a work that does not meet the standards of beauty at all and is considered by many people to be bad, but when viewed from many things turn out to show beauty. Beauty should have been judged when works of art were first created, but the definition of beauty was first documented by the philosopher Plato who determined beauty from proportion, harmony, and unity.",

Under the direct guidance of the abbot, Shantideva became very good at learning, debating, and many other things. Although he was an extraordinary scholar, he did not show his intelligence to others. A group of students from a school in Nalanda were not happy to see Shantideva and wanted to expel him from the monastery. They loudly said that Nalanda was a monastery full of famous scholars, and he belittled Shantideva by saying that Shantideva was not a scholar at all, all he knew was eating, sleeping, urinating, and defecating. Therefore they challenged Shantideva to give Dharma lessons, if he did not want to, then he should immediately leave the monastery. The first request was rejected, then the second request he accepted. They made a plan to insult him in front of other classmates. They built a very high throne, so that Shantideva could not climb and sit on the throne. The monk of the school also gathered a number of other monks of the school. As Shantideva walked towards the throne, touched it gently and the big and tall throne suddenly became low and Shantideva could climb on it. At that moment they all felt strange, how could this happen? Then Shantideva sat on the throne and asked them, \"What lesson should he give, something that has already been taught or something that has never been taught?\" They begged him to teach a dharma lesson that had never been taught before.",

Then the energy goes to the words that are inside, spoken words, silence, motion, style, assertiveness, or doing something. Examples of Using the Energy of Faith. 1. A baby who can't walk yet feels sure he can walk and then tries to do it, because he wants to walk. When he didn't succeed, he cried sadly, his belief changed to believing or doubting, but he became convinced again when he wanted to be able to walk. Then his parents taught him little by little until he could walk. 2. A cellphone user has never seen a cellphone creator, but still believes that cellphones have benefits for life. Even though here and there there are still problems or misuse of cellphones and so on, he is still confident. Previously, he was someone who didn't know cell phones, came to know cellphones, learned them little by little, until he was sure of using cellphones in his daily life. 3. An alcoholic is sure that he must choose hatred, then he says he hates other people, but so that he is seen as a victim, because he wants money or alcohol. 4. A brawler believes he still chooses revenge, because he doesn't want anything and because he wants to fight. 5. Someone who feels sorry for seeing other people's circumstances helps him confidently without hesitation. 6.

The nation's capital was previously located in Yangon before being transferred by the military junta government to Naypyidaw on November 7, 2005. Myanmar has joined as a member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) since 1997. Early civilization in Myanmar included a Tibeto-Burmese speaking population in Northern Burma and the Mon Kingdom in Southern Burma. In the 9th century, the Bamar people entered the upper valley of the Irrawaddy River, following which the Pagan Kingdom was founded in the 1050s. Since then, the Burmese language, including Theravada culture and Buddhism has slowly become dominant in the country. The Pagan Kingdom fell due to the Mongol invasion. In the 16th century, after being unified by the Taungoo Dynasty, the country briefly became the largest empire in Southeast Asian history. In the 19th century, the Konbaung dynasty ruled the area that includes modern Myanmar and briefly controlled Manipur and Assam. The British ruled Myanmar after the 3 Anglo-Burmese Wars in the 19th century and the country later became a British colony. Myanmar gained independence in 1948, initially as a democracy, but after a 1962 coup it was ruled by the military.",

The Anschluss was part of the efforts of German leader Adolf Hitler (who himself was of Austrian origin) to establish a Reich unifying the German-speaking areas. After successfully taking over Austria, Nazi Germany acquired the Sudetenland (inhabited by German-speaking people) from Czechoslovakia in September 1938. Prior to the Anschluss, Nazi groups in Germany and Austria wanted the unification of the two countries because according to them the people of Germany and Austria were one nation who speak the same language, namely German. On the other hand, Austrian Chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg tried to defend his country's independence despite constant pressure from the Nazis. Schuschnigg planned a referendum for 13 March 1938 in the hope that the Austrian people would demonstrate their desire to remain independent. However, an ultimatum from Nazi Germany forced Schuschnigg to step down. The March 13 referendum was cancelled. The German armed forces called the Wehrmacht then entered Austrian territory on March 12, 1938 to annex the country. The Wehrmacht met no resistance at all. German troops and Hitler instead get a warm welcome. On March 13, 1938, Germany passed the law formalizing the Anschluss. About one month later, on April 10, 1938, the Nazi regime held a plebiscite so that the Austrian people could \"pass\" the law. The results of the plebiscite showed that 99.75% of voters in Austria supported unification.

A provisional government was formed in Austria on April 27, 1945, and Austrian territory was then divided into four Allied zones of occupation, each administered by the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and France. Austrian sovereignty was only restored in 1955 after the signing of the Austrian State Treaty. Regarding Austria's role in World War II, the United States, Soviet Union and Britain signed the Moscow Declaration on 30 October 1943 which stated that Austria was \"the first country to fall victim to Hitler's aggression\". The Austrian provisional government in 1946 also spread the myth of Austria as the \"first victim of the Nazis\" by publishing the Red-White-Red Book (Rot-Wei\u00df-Rot-Buch). This myth continued to be adhered to in Austria until the international scandal took place in 1986 which ensnared Austrian President Kurt Waldheim due to his involvement as an aide-de-camp (personal assistant) in the Wehrmacht. Now the myth of the \"first victim of the Nazis\" has been dispelled, and the Austrian government itself has also acknowledged Austria's involvement in Nazi crimes. The word \"Anschluss\" in German literally means \"connection\", \"connection\" or \"contact\". There are sources that call the Anschluss \"unification\". However, various modern sources also describe the Anschluss as an \"annexation\". In German, the events of the Anschluss are usually written in quotation marks (\u201eAnschluss\u201c) by historians. According to Austrian historian Florian Wenninger, this was intended to distance itself from a term used by Nazi propaganda to cover up the fact that Austria's takeover was violent. However, not all historians follow this practice; Austrian historian Kurt Bauer omitted the quotation marks for the sake of legibility. According to him, the historical relation of the Anschluss can be seen from the context, and he also feels that the practice of using quotation marks spreads because it is considered to be a habit and does not offend.",

This phenomenon can only be enjoyed in countries far from the equator, one of the countries where natural phenomena are good to see is New Zealand. On earth, auroras occur in the area around its magnetic North and South Poles. The aurora that is in the sky at the south pole is called the Aurora Australis, while the Aurora that is in the sky at the north pole of the earth is called the Aurora Borealis. Auroras that occur in the north are known as Aurora Borealis (IPA /\u0254\u02c8\u0279\u0254\u0279\u0259 b\u0254\u0279i\u02c8\u00e6l\u026as/), named after the Roman goddess of dawn, Aurora, and the Greek name for the north wind, Boreas. This is because in Europe, the aurora often looks reddish on the northern horizon as if the sun will rise from that direction. The aurora borealis always occurs between September and October and March and April. The aurora phenomenon in the south, known as Aurora Australis, has similar characteristics. But sometimes auroras appear on mountain peaks in tropical climates. Several important things related to the formation of the aurora, namely: This aurora phenomenon is related to the magnetic field envelope or the earth's magnetosphere and the activity of the appearance of light from the sun. The stronger and longer the aurora's light, the stronger the disturbance from the sun, known as a solar storm, can be expected. A solar storm is a cycle of violent explosive activity from the peak of sunspot activity, usually every 11 years it will enter a period of solar storm activity.",

        "paragraph": "Meanwhile, disturbances that occur in the earth's magnetic field are called magnetic storms. The sudden change in the magnetic field causes charged particles in the atmosphere to increase or change direction (for example, in the ionosphere). Auroras can also appear when further phenomena occur in the magnetosphere known as magnetic sub-storms. This event gives rise to the oval aurora at the poles of the earth which are symmetrical to each other. Although this phenomenon has been suspected by experts for a long time, new observational evidence (Blue & Pink) was obtained in 2001 through NASA satellite observations. The role of a large magnetic field in the occurrence of aurora causes aurora to occur most often in the area around the magnetic north pole and south pole, and very rarely occurs in the equator. The famous aurora are Aurora Borealis (at the north pole) and Aurora Australis (at the south pole). The aurora borealis is most commonly seen in Fairbanks, Alaska, and in some locations in Eastern Canada, Iceland and Northern Scandinavia. Aurora australis is the least frequently seen because this aurora usually looks bright in areas that are sparsely populated. Aurora australis is usually seen in Australia on the 11-year cycle of sunspot activity. The solar maximum occurred in 2000. Aurora Australis has been seen in Tasmania. Apart from location, weather and pollution, light also affects the quality of the aurora. In Alaska, the best time to see the aurora is in the months of March and September to late October. At that time the sky was dark and the weather was very bright. In summer, the night sky is not so dark. In winter, on the other hand, the air gets too cold, thus disturbing the comfort of those who want to observe it. Aurora appears in many different forms.",

The term H\u00e1nli\u00fa (\u97d3\u6d41, Korean: \ud55c\ub958; Hallyu) was adopted by the Chinese media after a Korean pop music album, H.O.T, was released in China.

South Korean broadcasting authorities have sent delegations to promote their TV programs and cultural content in several countries.

Statistics generally works by using numerical data which is the result of counting or measurement results using categorical data that are classified according to certain criteria. Statistics is a science related to data. Statistics is the data itself, the information, or the result of applying statistical algorithms to that data. From a collection of data, statistics can be used to conclude or describe data; This is what is called descriptive statistics. Information is then recorded as well as collected both in the form of numerical information and categorical information which is referred to as an observation. Most of the basic concepts of statistics provide assumptions about probability theory. Some statistical terms include the following: population, sample, sample unit, probability. Statistics has also been widely applied in various scientific disciplines, both natural sciences (eg astronomy and biology as well as social sciences (including sociology and psychology), as well as in business (regarding products, etc.), economics, and industry.

In the Middle Ages, statistics developed within the church and was used to record the number of births, deaths and marriages. In the 17th century AD, statistics was applied in England as political arithmetic. The term statistics was then put forward by a German mathematician named Gottfried Achenwall (1719-1772). In the 18th century, the term statistics was popularized by John Sinclair (1791-1799) in his book entitled Statistical Account of Scotland. In the 19th century and early 20th century statistics began to make extensive use of fields in mathematics, especially probability. The branch of statistics currently widely used to support the scientific method, statistical inference, was developed in the second half of the 19th and early 20th centuries by Karl Pearson (introducing the linear regression method and the standard deviation term in 1894), Ronald Fisher ( founding fathers of inferential statistics and publishing Design of Experiments in 1935), and William Sealey Gosset (researching small sample problems).

The capital city of this settlement was built at the mouth of Sungai Merbok, which is now known as Sungai Batu.

Solubility is expressed in the maximum amount of solute that dissolves in a solvent at equilibrium. The resulting solution is called a saturated solution. Certain substances are soluble in any ratio to a solvent. An example is ethanol in water. This trait is more precisely in English called miscible. The solvent is generally a liquid which can be a pure substance or a mixture. The dissolved substance can be a gas, another liquid, or a solid. Solubility varies from always soluble as ethanol in water, to poorly soluble, as silver chloride in water. The term \"insoluble\" is often applied to compounds that are poorly soluble, although in fact there are very few cases where there is really no substance dissolved. Under some conditions, the equilibrium solubility may be exceeded to give a so-called supersaturated solution which is metastable. Under certain conditions, the solubility equilibrium can be exceeded to produce what is called a supersaturated solution, which is metastable. Crystal metastability can also lead to visible differences in the amount of dissolved chemical depending on the shape or size of the crystalline particles. A supersaturated solution generally crystallizes when 'seeds' of crystals appear and equilibration rapidly occurs. Phenylsalicylate is one of the substances observed when it melts completely and then cools below its fusion point. The solubility ranges widely, from very soluble (indefinitely) (completely dissolved) like ethanol in water, to very insoluble, like silver chloride in water. The term insoluble is sometimes used for compounds that are very insoluble. A number of other descriptive terms are used to classify the degree of solubility for a given application.",

        "paragraph": "The threshold for describing something as insoluble, or a term similar to it, may depend on the application. For example, one source states that a substance is described as \"insoluble\" when its solubility is less than 0.1 g per 100 mL of solvent. A large number of reactions used in qualitative inorganic analysis involve the formation of precipitates. The precipitate is a substance that separates itself as a solid phase out of solution. The precipitate may be crystalline (crystalline) or colloidal, and can be removed from solution by filtration or centrifugation. A precipitate forms if the solution becomes oversaturated with the substance in question. The solubility (S) of a precipitate, by definition, is equal to the molar concentration of the saturated solution. Solubility depends on various conditions, such as temperature, pressure, the concentration of other ingredients in the solution, and on the composition of the solvent. The change in solubility with pressure is of no practical importance in qualitative inorganic analyses, since all the work was carried out in an open vessel at atmospheric pressure; slight change of atmospheric pressure has no significant effect on solubility. Of particular importance is the change in solubility with temperature. In general it can be said that the solubility of precipitates increases with increasing temperature, although in some exceptional cases (such as potassium sulfate), the opposite occurs. The rate of increase in solubility with temperature varies, in some cases it is very small, in other cases it is very large. In some cases the change in solubility with changing temperature can be the basis for separation. For example, separation of lead ions from silver and mercury(I) can be achieved by precipitating the three ions first as chlorides, followed by adding hot water to the mixture. This hot water will dissolve lead(II) chloride, but silver and mercury(I) chloride are practically insoluble in it.",

As a branch of biology, the scope of parasitology is not determined by the organisms or the environment it relates to, but by their way of life, which means that this field is synthesized with other fields, and uses techniques such as cell biology, bioinformatics, biochemistry, molecular biology, immunology, genetics, evolution. and ecology. This study of diverse organisms means that the field is often broken down into simpler, more focused units that employ common techniques, even if the field is not studying the same organism or disease. Most research in parasitology falls between 2 or more of these definitions. Generally, the study of prokaryotes is included in the field of bacteriology rather than parasitology. One of the largest fields of parasitology, medical parasitology is the study of a number of parasites that infect humans, which includes organisms such as: Medical parasitology can involve drug development, epidemiological studies and zoonotic studies. Study of parasites that cause economic losses in agricultural or aquaculture operations, or that infect companion animals. Examples of species studied are: Is a study of the protein structure of parasites. Determination of the structure of parasite proteins can help understand how these proteins function differently from homologous proteins in humans. In addition, protein structure can inform the drug discovery process. Parasites can provide information about the ecology of host populations. For example, in fisheries biology, parasite communities can be used to distinguish different populations of fish species that together inhabit that area. In addition, parasites have a number of special traits and life history strategies that allow them to colonize hosts. Understanding these aspects of parasite ecology can shed light on the host's parasite avoidance strategies.",

Apart from being a philosopher, he is also known as an orator and an accomplished debater. In addition, he was famous as a teacher who taught many youths of his time. Protagoras came from Abdera which is located on the north coast of the Aegean Sea. He lived between 490 BC - 420 BC. He made frequent trips to other countries, including several visits to Athens. In Athens, Protagoras was asked by Pericles to take part in drafting a constitution for the Athenian colony of Thurioi in 444 BC. According to the testimony of Diogenes Laertios, at the end of his life Protagoras was accused in Athens of blasphemy against religion. Protagoras' books were publicly burned. Then Protagoras is said to have fled to Sicily, but the boat in which he was traveling sank. Protagoras authored many books, but only a few fragments have survived. However, the contents of his philosophy can still be known because Protagoras's thoughts were widely discussed by subsequent philosophers. Plato is the main source, especially the two dialogues entitled Theaitetos and Protagoras. The most famous book of Protagoras is called \"The Truth\" (Aletheia). In a book entitled \"Truth\", Protagoras states that the human being referred to here is human as an individual. Thus, recognition of something depends on individuals who feel something with their five senses. For example for people who feel sick, the wind can feel cold. Meanwhile, for a healthy person, the wind feels hot. Here the two people are right, because the recognition of wind is based on the physical and psychological conditions of these people. A view like this can be said to be relativism because truth is based on each person who feels it.",

    {
        "paragraph": "In another work entitled \"Contradictory Positions\" (Antilogiai), Protagoras argues that this view is related to the notion of the relativity of human knowledge. If truth is determined by everyone, then it can be concluded that one opinion is no more correct than the opposite. The consequence of this is the art of speech. An orator must succeed in convincing his listeners of the truth he adheres to. Thus, it requires the ability to make convincing arguments for the listeners. According to Protagoras, the state was created by humans. The purpose of forming a country is so that humans can be released from the insecurities and difficulties of living in a wild nature. For this reason, humans establish relationships with other humans and form a state. However, then humans realize that living with other humans is not easy. With a myth, Protagoras stated that humans were given two things by the gods to be able to live with each other. These two things are awareness of justice (dike) and respect for others (aidos). With these two things, humans can live with each other. Humans do this by making laws or constitutions. Thus, certain laws are not truer than other laws. There are laws that are suitable for certain societies but not suitable for others. In his work entitled \"About the Gods\" (Peritheon), Protagoras stated that Protagoras' view is a skepticism, meaning that it is impossible to reach a truth. This fits perfectly with his relativistic view of cognition. During his lifetime, Protagoras influenced the minds of many young men through his thoughts on rhetoric and knowledge. He also influenced Democritus in his theory of knowledge and political philosophy. Apart from that, he also had a great influence on statesmen, poets, historians, and orators.",

Mineralogy is a part of geology that specifically studies minerals. Mineralogy is also part of the earth sciences. The scientific scope in mineralogy includes physical, chemical, optical and mechanical properties of minerals. Mineralogy can be divided into two scientific branches, namely physical mineralogy and optical mineralogy. Physical mineralogy specifically deals with the arrangement of crystals in minerals. In the science of physical mineralogy. The main study is mineral crystallography. The study of mineral crystallography is based on an understanding of elemental chemistry, stoichiometry, geometry and vectors. The primacy of mineral crystallography in physical mineralogy is caused by the condition of each mineral which is crystalline. Because of this, minerals have crystalline properties that can be described and projected. This depiction and projection is done in the form of a graphic presentation. This presentation enforces the laws of the crystallization mechanism. Soil mineralogy discusses solid minerals in the form of crystals with boundaries in the form of flat planes. Certain minerals have certain flat plane features. The main discussion in soil mineralogy is rock. Meanwhile, soil organic matter is not discussed in soil mineralogy. The formation of metamorphic rocks is the result of crystallization within the Earth's crust. These metamorphic rocks range between 3\u201320 kilometers below the Earth's surface. Most of the formation of metamorphic rocks do not go through a liquid phase and immediately become solid. The new physical environment with a certain pressure and temperature produces a new structure and mineralogy in metamorphic rocks.

The minerals contained in metamorphic rocks can originate from the original rock or result from metamorphism. Minerals due to metamorphism can be divided into three types. First, the common minerals in igneous and metamorphic rocks include biotite, hornblende, pyroxene, olivine and iron ore. Second, common minerals in sedimentary and metamorphic rocks include quartz, muscovite, clay minerals, calcite and dolomite. Third, minerals that only exist in metamorphic rocks include garnet, andalusite, cyanite, sillimanite, staautolite, cordierite, epidote and chlorite. Clay minerals at the beginning of the development of mineralogy are defined as minerals with fine textured grains. The grain diameter is smaller than 2 \u03bcm. Observations of its structure can no longer be done using an ordinary microscope. In its development, clay minerals are no longer interpreted based on the diameter of the grains, but on the shape of the layers which are like a pile of paper. The definition of clay minerals then turns into minerals that have a layered structure with an aluminosilika structure as a constituent of the framework. Grain mineralogy analysis is an analysis that aims to determine the mineral composition or mineral content in a grain-shaped mineral. The grain mineraological analysis process uses samples in the form of sand grains, sediment deposits, soil and rocks that have previously undergone preparation. The preparation process is carried out by panning method until it becomes concentrate. A binocular microscope is used as a tool for making observations. Another method that can be used is the X-ray fluorescence method. This method is widely used in mineralogy and other scientific fields. The advantage is that it only requires a small amount of grain mineral preparation so that the analysis process becomes faster.",

Tellurium is chemically related to selenium and sulfur, all three of which are chalcogens. It is sometimes found in its native form as elemental crystals. Tellurium is much more common in the Universe as a whole than it is on Earth. Its extreme rarity in the Earth's crust, comparable to that of platinum, is partly due to the formation of volatile hydrides which caused tellurium to be lost to space as a gas during Earth's formation, when conditions were very hot, and partly due to tellurium's low affinity for oxygen, which causes it to bind violently. preferential to the other chalcophiles in the solid minerals that permeate the Earth's core. Tellurium-carrying compounds were first discovered in 1782 in a gold mine at Kleinschlatten, Transylvania (now Zlatna, Romania) by the Austrian mineralogist Franz-Joseph M\u00fcller von Reichenstein, although it was Martin Heinrich Klaproth who named the new element in 1798 after the Latin word for \" earth\", Tellus. The mineral gold telluride is the best-known naturally occurring gold compound. However, they are not a commercially significant source of tellurium, which is usually extracted as a by-product of copper and tin production. Commercially, the main use of tellurium is in copper (copper tellurium) and steel alloys, where it can improve machinability. Applications in CdTe solar panels and cadmium telluride semiconductors also consume a large part of tellurium production. Tellurium is considered a critical element for technology. Tellurium has no biological function, although fungi can use it in place of sulfur and selenium in amino acids such as eggocysteine \u200b\u200band egg-methionine.

Tellurium is a semiconductor that exhibits greater electrical conductivity in certain directions depending on the alignment of the atoms, its conductivity increasing slightly when exposed to light (photoconductivity). When molten, tellurium is corrosive to copper, iron, and stainless steel.

Tellurium adopts a polymeric structure consisting of zig-zag chains of Te atoms. This gray material resists oxidation by air and is non-volatile. Naturally occurring tellurium has eight isotopes. Six of these isotopes, 120Te, 122Te, 123Te, 124Te, 125Te, and 126Te, are stable.

These aspects are limited in order to produce definite formulations. Science provides certainty by limiting the scope of its views, and the certainty of science is obtained from its limitations. Science is not just knowledge (knowledge), but summarizes a set of knowledge based on agreed theories and can be systematically tested with a set of methods that are recognized in a particular field of science. Viewed from a philosophical point of view, science is formed because humans try to think further about the knowledge they have. Science is a product of epistemology, in other words science is formed from 3 branches of philosophy namely ontology, epistemology and axiology, if these three branches are fulfilled it means that it is valid and recognized as a science. Natural science can only be certain after its field is limited to material matters, or psychology can only predict human behavior if its field of view is limited to general aspects of concrete human behavior.

A hypothesis is a conjecture that has not been supported or proven experimentally, and laws of physics or natural laws are scientific generalizations based on empirical observations. Mathematics is very important to science, especially in the role it plays in expressing scientific models. Observing and collecting measurement results, as well as making hypotheses and conjectures, inevitably requires mathematical models and exploitation. The branches of mathematics that are often used in science include calculus and statistics, although in fact all branches of mathematics have applications, even \"pure\" fields such as number theory and topology. Some thinkers view mathematicians as scientists, assuming that mathematical proofs are equivalent to experiments. Others do not consider mathematics as a science, because it does not require experimental tests on theories and hypotheses. However, despite these two assumptions, the fact that mathematics is important as a very useful tool for describing/explaining the universe has become a major issue for the philosophy of mathematics. See Eugene Wigner, The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics. Richard Feynman said, \"Mathematics is not real, but it feels real. Where does it belong?\", while Bertrand Russell was fond of defining mathematics as \"a subject about which we never know what we are talking about, nor do we know the truth of it\".

Platinum is a member of the platinum group elements and is an element in group 10 of the periodic table. It has six naturally occurring isotopes. This metal is one of the rarest elements in the earth's crust with an average abundance of about 5 \u00b5g/kg. It occurs in several nickel and copper ores along with several natural deposits, mostly in South Africa, which accounts for 80% of world production. Due to its scarcity in the earth's crust, only a few hundred tons are produced annually, and for its important uses, it is highly valuable and a major precious metal commodity. Platinum is the least reactive metal. Its amazing resistance to corrosion, even at high temperatures, has earned it the title of noble metal. Consequently, platinum is often found as a naturally occurring element. Because it occurs naturally in the alluvial sands of rivers, it was first used by the indigenous people of pre-Columbian South America to make artifacts. European writings refer to the 16th century, but the report of Antonio de Ulloa who published a new metal in Colombia in 1748 became the object of research by scientists. Platinum is used in catalytic converters, laboratory equipment, electrical contacts and electrodes, platinum resistance thermometers, dental equipment, and jewelry. Because it is a heavy metal, platinum has health problems when exposed to its salts, but because of its resistance to corrosion, platinum is not as toxic as some other metals.

The most common oxidation states of platinum are +2 and +4. The +1 and +3 oxidation states are less common, and are sometimes stabilized by metallic bonds in bimetallic (or polymetallic) species. As expected, tetracoordinated platinum(II) compounds tend to adopt a 16-electron planar quadrilateral geometry. Although elemental platinum is usually unreactive, it dissolves in hot aqua regia to form chloroplatinic acid (H): As a weak acid, platinum has a great affinity for sulfur, as for dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO); a number of DMSO complexes have been reported and the choice of reaction solvent must be made with great care.

The catalytic reaction rate occurs over a large surface area in solid fluids so that it is applied to porous solid materials. In a chemical reaction, the catalyst does not act as a chemical reactant or product. Commonly used catalysts are metal ions by impregnation method to produce zero valence and acid sites during the reduction process. The role of the catalyst is to increase the catalytic performance of solid materials. A catalyst is a substance that speeds up the reaction rate of a chemical reaction. The acceleration of the rate of reaction occurs at a certain temperature by lowering the activation energy of a reaction, without affecting the results of the reaction (product). It should be noted that the catalyst participates in the reaction. This can be proven by conducting experiments. At the end of the reaction, it will be found that the effectiveness of a catalyst is reduced. This is the proof that the catalyst reacts in a reaction. A catalyst plays a role in the reaction but not as a reactant or product. Catalysts allow reactions to occur more quickly or allow reactions to occur at lower temperatures due to the changes they induce in the reactants. The catalyst provides an alternative pathway with a lower activation energy. Catalyst reduced energy needed for reaction. Catalysts can be divided into two main groups: homogeneous catalysts and heterogeneous catalysts. Heterogeneous catalysts are catalysts that exist in a different phase from the reactants in the reaction they catalyze, whereas homogeneous catalysts are in the same phase. One simple example of heterogeneous catalysis is that of the catalyst providing a surface on which the reactants (or substrates) are temporarily adsorbed.

The esterification reaction requires an acid or base catalyst to accelerate the reaction between glycerol and fatty acids to produce monoglycerides, diglycerides and water. The catalyst is fed at a heating temperature between 210\u00b0C and 230\u00b0C. The ratio between glycerol and fatty acids in the reaction will determine the monoglyceride composition.

In Indonesian, the Greek term is also known, especially the mention of Greek, which was absorbed from Latin: Graecus, namely to name the area now located to the north of Greece, which was once inhabited by the Graekos tribe. The area around Attica was inhabited since the Upper Paleolithic period (30,000\u201310,000 BC), but archaeological evidence can only show that the small caves around the \"Athenian Acropilis\" and the \"Klepsythra\" spring were used in the Neolithic period (3000\u20132800 BC). It was in this area of \u200b\u200bGreece that European culture first appeared, starting with the \"Cycladic\" civilization on the islands of the Aegean Sea around 3000 BC, the \"Minoan\" civilization on the island of Crete (2700\u20131500 BC) and the \"Mycenaean Greek\" civilization on the mainland (1900\u20131100 BC). The period between 1200 and 800 BC known as the \"Greek Dark Ages\" is thought to have followed the Dorian invasion, which ended the Mycenaean age. Two of the most famous works of Greek literature, Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, were written during this period. At the end of the Greek Dark Ages, various states and city-states emerged throughout the Greek peninsula to the Black Sea coast, Greater Greece (Southern Italy) and Anatolia (Asia Minor/Asia Minor), achieving high levels of prosperity with rapid cultural development, such as evidences of architectural heritage, drama, science and philosophy, which are preserved in a democratic environment.",

The worst was the Peloponnesian War, because it marked the end of the Athenian Empire as an important ruler in Greece. In 500 BC, the Persian Empire (Achaemenid Empire) controlled this region. Alexander the Great's empire stretched from Greece in the west to Pakistan in the east and Egypt in the south, before his sudden death in 323 BC. After his death, the kingdom split into a number of smaller countries, which eventually became the 4 leading states:1. Ptolemaic kingdom in Egypt (south) 2. Seleucid Empire in Persia (east)3. Kingdom of Pergamon in Asia Minor (north)4. Kingdom of Macedonia in Greece (west). The Eastern Roman Empire lasted more than 1000 years, from the 4th century AD to 1453. During its existence, the Byzantines were an important economic, cultural and military force in Europe. The Ottoman Empire began to colonize Greece in the late 14th century. By the time Istanbul (Constatinople) fell in 1453, much of the Byzantine Empire, including its second largest city (which is now the second largest city in modern Greece), Thessaloniki, had been captured by the Ottomans. By the 1500s most of Greece was under Ottoman rule, including Cyprus (captured 1571) and Crete (captured 1670). The parts not controlled by the Ottomans were the Ionian islands, which remained independent under the protection of the Republic of Venice until annexation by the First French Republic in 1797 and Great Britain in 1809, and were restored to unity with Greece in 1864. After years of negotiations, the Republic The First Hellenic was finally recognized under the London Protocol in 1830.

His political and religious teachings were known in the Magna Graecia area at his time and influenced the thinking of Plato and Aristotle, so that he indirectly influenced the development of Western philosophy. Details about his life are shrouded in legend, but he seems to have been the son of Mnesarkos, a jewel engraver or wealthy merchant on the island of Samos, off the coast of Anatolia. Modern scholars are still debating who was Pythagoras' teacher and which thinkers had influenced him. However, they agree that around 530 BC, Pythagoras moved to Croton on the Italian coast and founded a society with a special membership. Those who wish to join must be initiated first, and the community follows a lifestyle of togetherness and seclusion. This community also has rules regarding food. It is said that his followers were supposed to be vegetarians, but modern scholars doubt whether Pythagoras really ever required his followers to abstain from meat. The most obvious teaching propounded by Pythagoras was metempsychosis, namely the belief that every soul is immortal, and that after death it passes into a new body. He may also have been the originator of the doctrine of musica universalis, according to which the planets move according to mathematical equations, thus producing an inaudible musical symphony. Scholars still debate whether some of the numerology and musical teachings associated with the name Pythagoras were actually developed by him or were creations of his followers after his death, especially Philolaus of Croton. After Kroton defeated its neighbor Sibaris around 510 BC, the followers of Pythagoras came into conflict with the supporters of democracy, as a result the meeting hall of the Pythagoreans was burned down.",

He is also said to have been the first to call himself a philosopher (\"lover of wisdom\") and to divide the world into five climatic zones. However, classical historians still debate whether Pythagoras actually made these discoveries, and many of the accomplishments attributed to his name may have preceded or been instigated by his contemporaries or successors. In addition, it is still debated whether he really has contributed to the field of mathematics or natural philosophy. Pythagorean thought influenced Plato, and Plato's dialogues (especially Timaios) show the influence of Pythagoreanism. The Pythagorean notion of mathematical perfection also had an impact on ancient Greek art. Pythagoreanism made a comeback in the first century BC among medieval Platonists, which coincided with the emergence of neopythagoreanism. Pythagoras continues to be regarded as a major philosopher in the Middle Ages, and his philosophy was very influential on scientists such as Nicolaus Copernicus, Johannes Kepler, and Isaac Newton. Pythagorean symbolism is also used by modern Western esotericists, and its teachings as detailed in the Metamorphoses by Roman poet Ovidius have influenced the modern vegetarian movement. None of the original writings of Pythagoras have survived into modern times. In addition, there is almost no information about his life that can be confirmed. The first sources on Pythagoras' life are brief, ambiguous, and often satirical. The first source dealing with Pythagoras's teachings is a satirical poem probably written after his death by Xenophanes of Colophon, one of his contemporaries.",

A nation is also defined as a political-cultural community that is aware of autonomy, unity and common interests. In international law, nation is the term for a sovereign state.

For the most part, the members of a nation remain strangers to one another and may never meet. Hence the phrase, \"a nation of strangers\" is used by writers such as the American journalist Vance Packard. So the nation is the reality of intersubjectivity and exists solely in the minds of the people's shadows. Even if someone finally believes that the nation does not exist, the nation will still not be threatened, because the nation is not a reality of subjectivism that exists in one person's mind.

Controversy about the properties of silicon dates back to its discovery: Silicon was first prepared in its pure form in 1824 under the name silisium (from the Latin: silicis), with the suffix -ium meaning metal. However, in 1831, the name was changed to silicon due to its closer physical properties to carbon. and boron.

Several types of living things that need it, among others, types of sponges and microorganism types of diatoms. Silicon is used to make their body structure. Silicon is solid at room temperature, with melting and boiling points of 1,400 and 2,800 degrees Celsius, respectively. Interestingly, silicon has a greater density when in liquid form than in its solid form. But like most other substances, silicon doesn't mix in its solid phase, but only expands, just as ice has a lower density than water. Due to its high thermal conductivity (149 W m\u22121 K\u22121), silicon conducts heat so it is never used to insulate hot objects. In its crystalline form, pure silicon is metallic gray.

Pure methane is odorless, but when used for commercial purposes, a slight odor of sulfur is usually added to detect any possible leaks. As the main component of natural gas, methane is the main fuel source. Combustion of one molecule of methane with oxygen releases one molecule of CO2 (carbon dioxide) and two molecules of H2O (water): Methane is a greenhouse gas. The concentration of methane in the atmosphere in 1998, expressed as mole fractions, was 1,745 nmol/mol (parts per billion), up from 700 nmol/mol in 1750. By 2008, the concentration of methane gas in the atmosphere had increased again to 1,800 nmol/ mole. Methane is a tetrahedral molecule with four equivalent C-H bonds. Its electronic structure can be explained by 4 bonding molecular orbitals resulting from complementary C and H valence orbitals. The low energy molecular orbitals result from the 2s orbitals on the carbon atom pairing with the 1s orbitals of 4 hydrogen atoms. At room temperature and standard pressure, methane is a colorless and odorless gas. The smell of methane (which is deliberately created for safety reasons) is produced by the addition of an odorant such as methanthiol or ethanthiol. Methane has a boiling point of \u2212161 \u00b0C (\u2212257.8 \u00b0F) at 1 atmosphere. As a gas, methane is only flammable when its concentration reaches 5-15% in air. Liquid methane will not burn unless subjected to high pressure (4-5 atmospheres). The main reactions in methane are combustion, reformation of the vapor to syngas, and halogenation.

Protonation of methane can be prepared by reacting it with superacids to produce CH5+, sometimes called methanium ions. In the methane combustion reaction, there are several steps that are skipped. The initial product obtained is formaldehyde (HCHO or H2CO). Formaldehyde oxidation produces formyl radical (HCO), which in turn produces carbon monoxide (CO): H2 is oxidized to H2O and releases heat. This reaction takes place very quickly, usually even less than a millisecond. Eventually, CO will oxidize and form CO2 while releasing heat. This reaction proceeds more slowly than the other steps, usually taking several milliseconds.

A transistor can function as a kind of electric valve, where based on its input current (BJT) or input voltage (FET), it allows a very accurate flow of electricity from the power supply circuit. In general, a transistor has 3 terminals, namely Base (B), Emitter (E) and Collector (C). The voltage at one terminal, for example the emitter, can be used to regulate currents and voltages that are greater than the base input (input) current, namely the output voltage and output current (output) of the collector. Transistor is a very important component in the world of modern electronics. In analog circuits, transistors are used in amplifiers (amplifiers). Analog circuits include loudspeakers, stabilizers, and radio signal amplifiers. In digital circuits, transistors are used as high-speed switches. Some transistors can also be arranged in such a way that they function as logic gates, memory and other circuit functions. Basically, transistors and vacuum tubes have a similar function; both regulate the amount of electric current flowing. To understand how semiconductors work, consider a glass filled with pure water.

This is because arsenic has 5 atoms in its outer orbit, whereas silicon has only 4. Conduction occurs because free charge carriers have been added (by the excess electrons from Arsenic). In this case, an n-type silicon (n for negative, since the charge carriers are electrons which are negatively charged) has been formed. Additionally, silicon can be mixed with boron to make p-type semiconductors. Since Boron has only 3 electrons in its outermost orbit, new charge carriers, called \"holes\" (positive charge carriers), will form in the layout of the silicon crystal. In a vacuum tube, charge carriers (electrons) are emitted by thermionic emissions from a cathode heated by a filament wire. Therefore, vacuum tubes cannot create positive charge carriers (holes). It can be seen that charge carriers with the same charge will repel each other, so that without any other force, these charge carriers will be evenly distributed in the semiconductor material. But in a bipolar transistor (or diode junction) where a p-type semiconductor and an n-type semiconductor are fabricated on a single silicon chip, these charge carriers tend to migrate toward the P-N junction (the boundary between the p-type semiconductor and the diode junction). n-type), because they are attracted by opposite charges from across it.

While these winds can be very destructive or highly destructive, tropical cyclones are an important part of the atmospheric circulation system, which transfers heat from the equator to higher latitudes. The most fertile tropical cyclone growth area in the world is the northwest region of the Pacific Ocean, followed by the southeastern region of the Indian Ocean or the western waters of Australia. As explained by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, the growth of cyclones in the region reaches an average of 10 times per year. Tropical cyclones apart from destroying the areas they pass through, also cause flooding. Australia has developed early warnings to reduce the risk of tropical cyclones since the 1960s. By structure, a tropical cyclone is a giant area of \u200b\u200bvarying cloud, wind, and thunderstorm activity. The primary energy source for a tropical cyclone is the release of condensation/condensation heat from water vapor that condenses at high altitudes. Therefore, a tropical cyclone can be interpreted as a giant churning coal machine. The elements of a tropical cyclone include pre-existing weather disturbance, warm tropical oceans, moisture (moisture), and relatively mild winds. If the right conditions persist long enough, they can link together to produce fierce winds, incredible waves, torrential rains, and floods alongside this phenomenon. The use of this condensation as a driving force is the primary difference that distinguishes tropical cyclones from other meteorological phenomena.

As a result, when a tropical cyclone passes over land, its strength decreases rapidly. Tropical cyclones are classified into three main groups: tropical depressions, tropical storms, and a third group whose name depends on the area. A tropical depression is a system of falling clouds and thunderstorms with maximum surface circulation and sustained winds of less than 17 meters per second (33 knots, 38 m/h, or 62 km/h). It has no eyes, and is not characteristic of the spiraling shape of the stronger storms. It is already a low pressure system, however, hence the name \"depression\".

Wind turbines can convert kinetic energy in the wind into mechanical energy. The part of the turbine that is capable of converting this form of energy is called the turbine blade. Energy changes carried out by wind turbines always experience losses. The reason is that not all of the potential kinetic energy of the wind can be converted into other forms of energy by the turbine. The energy that can be converted is greater when the energy losses due to the shape of the turbine are smaller. The kinetic energy generated by the turbine is then forwarded to the gearbox which is connected to an electric generator. Then the generator will convert the mechanical energy from the wind turbine into electrical energy. The mechanical energy generated by a wind turbine can be estimated by measuring the wind speed. The most common type of measuring instrument is the anemometer. Gas turbine is a turbine with a driving medium in the form of a gaseous fluid. This fluid comes from a fan that introduces the working fluid into the heating system. The fluid is heated in the combustion engine. Types of internal combustion engines can vary from internal combustion engines to external combustion engines. Combustion of this fluid produces hot gas which is then flowed to the turbine.",

Hamburg was founded in 825. With an area of \u200b\u200b755 km2 and crossed by the river Elbe, this city is classified as a cosmopolitan city thanks to the reputation of its sons such as the famous classical composers Felix Mendelssohn and Johannes Brahms and director and theater player Gustaf Grudgens of the Deutsche Schauspielhaus. The city of Hamburg has a strong publishing industry which began to develop in the 17th century. The physical character of this city is marked by the canal system that divides it. Hamburg also has beautiful lakes, parks and museums including the Kunsthalle (1868), Museum of Arts and Crafts (1877), Museum of Ethnology and Prehistory (1878). Its official name reflects Hamburg's history as a member of the Hanseatic League in medieval times and an independent imperial city from the Holy Roman Empire. Prior to the German Unification in 1871, Hamburg was a fully sovereign city-state, and prior to 1919 it formed a civil republic governed constitutionally by the hereditary great burgher class or Hanseaten. Struck by disasters such as the Great Hamburg Fire, the North Sea floods of 1962 and military conflicts including bombing raids during World War II, the city has managed to recover and become more prosperous after each disaster. The history of the city of Hamburg is both tragic and romantic. Located between the Elbe and Alster rivers, Hammaburg castle was built in 825 and became the home of the Archbishop of Ansgar, which made it a base for expanding Christian influence over the pre-Christian population of Northern Europe. The city was burnt to the ground by the Vikings in 845, but was later rebuilt only to be burned again 8 times in 300 years.",

This league strengthened the economy of the cities of the unified North Germany. Trade flourished, and Hamburg became a major port of trade between Russia and Flanders with its position as ruler and guardian of the river Elbe. Although the Hanseatic League broke up in the late Middle Ages, Hamburg continued to grow. Its growth has outpaced L\u00fcbeck. The Hamburg stock exchange was founded in 1558. Between 1616-1625, Hamburg built its own defenses and also built public facilities such as an orphanage built in 1604 and a hospital built in 1605. In 1625, the city strengthened its defenses so that it could continue its trading activities went through hard times in the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648) which left other cities in a slump. It's just that when it was attacked by the French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte in 1830, Hamburg was subdued and then dissolved in the French Empire. However, after Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte fell, Hamburg was able to reclaim its former glory as a free Hanseatic port city. Trade also expanded to Africa, America and Asia. Since rebuilding the damage suffered by its port during World War II, Hamburg has reclaimed its position as Germany's main port and has become one of the most important ports in Northern Europe. In the early 1960s, members of the world famous band from Great Britain, The Beatles often performed regularly in the city of Hamburg and became so famous that it can be said that this city was the starting point of the band's success. There are 5 main churches in the city of Hamburg which were rebuilt after the big fire. The development of the city of Hamburg is marked by the many areas in the suburbs of Hamburg that have sprung up along the shores of Lake Aussenalster, and the many consulates general that occupy the beautiful Patrisian style houses in this city .",

        "paragraph": "Alkenes or olefins in organic chemistry are unsaturated hydrocarbons with a double bond between carbon atoms. The terms alkene and olefin are often used interchangeably (see Nomenclature section below). The simplest acyclic alkenes, which form one double bond and are not attached to any functional group, are known as mono-enes, forming a homologous series of hydrocarbons with the general formula CnH2n. Alkenes have two less hydrogen atoms than related alkanes (with the same number of carbon atoms). The simplest alkene is ethene or ethylene (C2H4) is the largest organic compound produced on an industrial scale. Aromatic compounds are often described as cyclic alkenes, but their structure and properties are different and so they are not considered alkenes. Like a single covalent bond, a double bond can be described in terms of overlapping atomic orbitals, except that, unlike a single bond (which consists of single sigma bonds), a carbon\u2013carbon double bond is composed of one sigma bond and one pi bond. These double bonds are stronger than single covalent bonds (611 kJ/mol for C=C vs 347 kJ/mol for C\u2013C) and also shorter, with an average bond length of 1.33 \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m (133 pm). Each carbon in the double bond uses three sp2 hybrid orbitals to form sigma bonds to three atoms (one other carbon and two hydrogen atoms). The non-hybridized 2p atomic orbitals, which are perpendicular to the plane created by the axes of the three sp\u00b2 hybrid orbitals, combine to form pi bonds. These bonds lie off the principal C\u2013C axis, with half of the bonds on one side of the molecule and half on the other. Rotation around a carbon\u2013carbon double bond is limited because it requires a large amount of energy to break the alignment of the p orbitals on the two carbon atoms.",

More complex alkenes may be named with the E\u2013Z notation for molecules with three or four distinct substituents (side groups). For example, in the butene isomer, two methyl groups (Z)-but-2-ene (aka cis-2-butene) appear on the same side of the double bond, and on (E)-but-2-ene (aka trans- 2-butene) methyl group appears on the opposite side. These two isomers of butene differ slightly in their chemical and physical properties. A 90\u00b0 turn of the C=C bond (which can be determined by the position of the functional group attached to the carbon) requires less energy than the strength of the pi bond, so the bond can hold. This contradicts the common statement in textbooks that p orbitals would not be able to maintain such bonds. In fact, the deviation of the p orbitals is less than expected due to pyramidalization (see: pyramidal alkenes). trans-Cyclooctene is a stable straight alkene with an orbital deviation of only 19\u00b0 with a dihedral angle of 137\u00b0 (normal 120\u00b0) and a pyramidalization degree of 18\u00b0. The trans cycloheptene isomer is only stable at low temperatures. As predicted by the VSEPR electron pair repulsion model, the molecular geometry of the alkene includes the bond angle around each carbon in the double bond being around 120\u00b0. The angle varies because the steric chain is affected by unbonding interactions between the functional groups attached to the carbon of the double bond. For example, the C-C-C bond angle in propylene is 123.9\u00b0. For bridged alkenes, the Bredt rule states that a double bond cannot form at the base of a bridged ring system unless the ring is large enough (8 or more atoms). The physical properties of alkenes do not differ much from alkanes. They are colorless, nonpolar, flammable, and nearly odorless.",

In mathematics, the concept of number has over the years been extended to include zero, negative numbers, rational numbers, irrational numbers, and complex numbers. Certain procedures that take numbers as input and produce other numbers as output are called numerical operations. The uner operation takes one input number and produces one output number. The more commonly encountered operation is the binary operation, which takes two numbers as input and produces one number as output. Examples of binary operations are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponents, and square roots. The field of mathematics that studies numerical operations is known as arithmetic. In everyday usage, number is often interpreted as either a number or a number, but the three terms are by definition distinct entities. A number is a sign or symbol used to represent a number. For example, the number five can be represented using the Hindu-Arabic numerals \"5\" (base 10 numeral system), \"101\" (binary numeral system), or using the Roman numeral 'V'. The symbols \"5\", \"1\", \"0\", and \"V\" used to represent the number five are called numbers. Number usually refers to one or more digits representing an integer in a sequence of consecutive integers. For example the word 'number 3' refers to a position in the sequence of numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, ..., etc. The word \"number\" is closely related to the notion of sequence. The early history of the emergence of numbers (mathematics) comes from nations that live along rivers such as the Egyptians in the Nile river, the Babylonians who inhabited the banks of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, the Indian Hindus along the Indus and Ganges rivers, and the Chinese along the the Huang Ho and Yang Tze rivers.",

In the development of human civilization, mathematics is increasingly needed in trade, finance, and tax collection. The number system used by ancient nations varied until it finally developed into the number currently used, namely the Hindu-Arabic number system. There are various types of numbers. The best known numbers are the integers 0, 1, -1, 2, -2, ... and the natural numbers 1, 2, 3, ..., both of which are often used to calculate in arithmetic. Integer itself is divided into three types, namely positive integers, negative integers, and zero. Whole numbers are the set of non-negative integers, namely {0, 1, 2, 3 ...}. In other words, the set of natural numbers is added by 0. So, whole numbers must have a positive sign. The set of all integers in algebra textbooks is usually represented by the symbol Z and the set of all natural numbers is usually represented by the symbol N. Any form of p/q ratio between two integers p and a non-zero integer q is called a rational number or a fraction. The set of all rational numbers is marked with Q. The elements of the three sets N, Z and Q above can still be 'sorted' (enumerated) without any being left or scattered. Sets of infinite size that can be sorted are called countable sets. The set of all natural numbers (real numbers), that is, all rational numbers combined with all irrational (or irrational) numbers, is represented by the symbol R.

An ecosystem can also be said to be a complete and comprehensive unitary arrangement between all elements of the environment that influence each other. An ecosystem is an amalgamation of each biosystem unit that involves reciprocal interactions between organisms and the physical environment so that the flow of energy leads to a certain biotic structure and a material cycle occurs between organisms and inorganics. The sun is the source of all existing energy. In an ecosystem, organisms in a community develop together with the physical environment as a system. Organisms will adapt to the physical environment, otherwise organisms also affect the physical environment for the purposes of life. This definition is based on the Gaia Hypothesis, namely: \"organisms, especially microorganisms, together with the physical environment produce a control system that maintains conditions on earth suitable for life\". This has led to the fact that the chemistry of the atmosphere and Earth is very controlled and very different from that of the other planets in the solar system. The presence, abundance and distribution of a species in an ecosystem is determined by the level of availability of resources and conditions of chemical and physical factors that must be within the range that can be tolerated by the species, this is what is called the law of tolerance. For example: Pandas have a wide tolerance for temperature, but has a narrow tolerance for its food, namely bamboo. Thus, pandas can live in ecosystems under any conditions as long as the ecosystem has bamboo as a food source. Unlike other living things, humans can widen their range of tolerance because of their ability to think, develop technology and manipulate nature.

Abiotic or non-living components are physical and chemical components which are the medium or substrate in which life takes place, or the environment in which life takes place. Most of the abiotic components vary in space and time. Abiotic components can be organic materials, inorganic compounds, and factors that influence the distribution of organisms, namely: Biotic is a term that is usually used to refer to living things (organisms). The biotic component is a component that makes up an ecosystem other than the abiotic (non-living) component. Based on their roles and functions, living things are divided into two types, namely: The heterotrophic component consists of organisms that utilize organic materials provided by other organisms as food. Heterotrophic components are also called macroconsumers (fagotrophs) because the food eaten is smaller. Heterotrophs include humans, animals, fungi and microbes. Decomposers or decomposers are organisms that decompose organic matter derived from dead organisms. Decomposers are also called macroconsumers (sapotrophs) because the food they eat is larger. Decomposing organisms absorb some of the results of this breakdown and release simple materials that can be reused by producers. Classified as decomposers are bacteria and fungi. There are also decomposers called detritivores, which are decomposer animals that eat the remains of organic matter, for example, wood lice.

Internet browsers receive HTML documents from web servers or from local storage and render documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the semantic structure of a web page and the prefixes that are included for the appearance of the document. HTML elements are described by tags, written using square brackets. Tags like <img /> and <input /> directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as <p> surround and provide information about the document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display HTML tags, but use them to interpret page content. HTML can embed programs written in scripting languages \u200b\u200bsuch as JavaScript, which influence the behavior and content of web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the appearance and layout of the content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the former maintainer of HTML and the current maintainer of CSS standards, has been pushing the use of CSS over explicit presentation HTML since 1997.

Nine years later, Berners-Lee proposed an internet-based markup system. Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the network and software in the late 1990s.

Many text elements are found in the ISO technical report in 1988 TR 9537 Techniques for using SGML, which in turn include language features of early text formats such as those used by the RUNOFF commander developed in the early 1960s for operating systems: these format commands are derived from commands used by typists to manually format CTSS documents. However, the SGML concept of generic markup is based on elements rather than just print effects, with separate structure and markup as well; HTML has increasingly moved in this direction with CSS. HTML documents are similar to ordinary written documents, only in this document an article can contain instructions marked with code or better known as certain tags. For example, if you want to make your text appear bold like: SHOW BLOCK, then write it in the following way: <b> SHOW BLOCK</b>.

Additionally, in Theology, Antinomianism is defined as someone who believes that only faith, not the moral law is necessary for salvation. In a theological sense, a person also tends to despise, and consider himself above all laws and social rules that are due to faith, grace or some special knowledge that makes salvation possible. Antinomianism, as a most radical ideology, arose in the 2nd and 3rd centuries in a sect of Adamites from North Africa. At that time, many currents within the Gnostics were antinomian. As for the Gnostic schools given by Demiurgos and Martin Luther, taught that the Torah law makes everyone aware of all the sins they have committed. However, this teaching from Luther was opposed by John from Agrrikola who said that the Torah law did not have any meaning or benefit. John of Agrrikola also said that a conversion occurs not because of the Torah law, but occurs through the preaching of the Gospel of Salvation. This statement caused a great debate between Luther and John. In 1537 to 1540, Luther continued to debate with John, emphasizing that the role of the law in the life of Christians was very important.

The electron has no known basic components or substructures, so it is believed to be an elementary particle. Electrons have a mass of about 1/1836 the mass of a proton. The intrinsic angular momentum (spin) of the electron is half its integer value in units of \u0127, which means that it is a fermion. The antiparticle of the electron is called the positron, which is identical to the electron, but has a positive charge. When an electron collides with a positron, the two may either scatter or completely annihilate, producing a pair (or more) of gamma-ray photons. Electrons, which belong to the first generation of the lepton particle family, participate in gravitational interactions, electromagnetic interactions and weak interactions. Like all matter, the electron has both particle-like and wave-like properties (wave-particle duality), so it can collide with other particles and diffract like light. Because electrons are fermions, two different electrons cannot occupy the same quantum state according to the Pauli exclusion principle. The concept of an indivisible electric charge was theorized to explain the chemical properties of atoms by the natural philosopher Richard Laming as early as 1838; The name electron was introduced for this charge in 1894 by the Irish physicist George Johnstone Stoney. The electron was identified as a particle in 1897 by J. J. Thomson. In many physical phenomena, such as electricity, magnetism and thermal conductivity, electrons play a very important role. An electron moving relative to the observer will generate a magnetic field and the trajectory of the electron will also be warped by the external magnetic field.

Electrons can be destroyed by annihilation with positrons, or they can be absorbed during stellar nucleosynthesis. Modern laboratory equipment can be used to load or monitor individual electrons. Electrons have many uses in modern technology, for example in electron microscopy, radiation therapy and particle accelerators. The Ancient Greeks noticed that amber attracted small objects when rubbed with animal hair. Apart from lightning, this phenomenon is one of humanity's earliest records of electricity. In his 1600 work De Magnete, English physicist William Gilbert coined the new term electricus to refer to the attracting property of small objects after being rubbed. The English word for electric is derived from the Latin \u0113lectrum, which comes from the Greek \u03ae\u03bb\u03b5\u03ba\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd (\u0113lektron) for amber. In 1737, C.

Its name is taken from the Neo-Latin molybdaenum, from the Ancient Greek \u039c\u03cc\u03bb\u03c5\u03b2\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2 molybdos, meaning lead, because its ore was confused with lead ore. The mineral molybdenum has been known throughout history, but the element was discovered (in the sense of distinguishing it as a new entity from salts of other metallic minerals) in 1778 by Carl Wilhelm Scheele. The metal was first isolated in 1781 by Peter Jacob Hjelm. Molybdenum does not occur naturally as a free metal on Earth; it is only found in various oxidation states in minerals. The free element, a silvery metal with gray stains, has the 6th melting point of all the elements. It readily forms stable and hard carbides in alloying metals, and for this reason, a large part of the element's world production (about 80%) is used in steel alloys, including high-strength alloys and superalloys. Most molybdenum compounds have low solubility in water, but when molybdenum minerals are exposed to oxygen and water, the resulting MoO molybdate ion is moderately soluble. On an industrial scale, molybdenum compounds (about 14% of world production) are used in high pressure and high temperature applications as pigments and catalysts. Molybdenum fixing enzymes are by far the most common bacterial catalysts for breaking chemical bonds in atmospheric nitrogen molecules in the nitrogen fixation process. At least 50 molybdenum enzymes are now known in bacteria and animals, although only bacterial and cyanobacterial enzymes are involved in nitrogen fixation. These nitrogenases contain molybdenum in a form different from the other molybdenum enzymes, which all contain fully oxidized molybdenum in a molybdenum cofactor. These molybdenum cofactor enzymes are essential for organisms, and molybdenum is an essential element for life in all higher eukaryotic organisms, though not in all bacteria.",

Mo has a melting point of 2,623\u00b0C (4,753\u00b0F; 2,896K); Of the natural elements, only tantalum, osmium, rhenium, tungsten and carbon have higher melting points. The weak oxidation of molybdenum begins at 300\u00b0C (572\u00b0F; 573K). It has one of the lowest coefficients of thermal expansion of the metals used commercially. The tensile strength of molybdenum wire increases about 3 times, from about 10 to 30 GPa, as the diameter decreases from ~50-100 nm to 10 nm. There are 35 known isotopes of molybdenum, with atomic masses ranging from 83 to 117, as well as four metastable nuclear isomers. Seven isotopes occur naturally, with atomic masses of 92, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, and 100. Of these naturally occurring isotopes, only molybdenum-100 is unstable. Molybdenum-98 is the most abundant isotope, making up 24.14% of all molybdenum. Molybdenum-100 has a half-life of about 1019 years and undergoes a double beta decay to become ruthenium-100. Molybdenum isotopes with mass numbers 111 to 117 all have half-lives of about 150 ns. All the unstable isotopes of molybdenum decay into niobium, technetium, and ruthenium. As also noted below, the most common isotopic molybdenum applications involve molybdenum-99, which is a product of fission. It is the parent radioisotope to the short-lived, gamma-emitting daughter radioisotope technetium-99m, a nuclear isomer used in a variety of imaging applications in medicine. In 2008, Delft University of Technology applied for a patent for the production of molybdenum-99 based on molybdenum-98. Molybdenum is a transition metal with an electronegativity of 2.16 on the Pauling scale and a standard atomic weight of 95.95 g/mol.",

As of December 2011, it had an area of \u200b\u200b141.22 km\u00b2 and an estimated population of 327,913; 19th largest city in Germany. Although Berlin replaced Bonn as the capital of unified Germany in 1990, it is still the political and administrative center. Approximately half of the functions of the federal government, many federal government departments, and several government agencies under federal ministries are still centralized in Bonn. In honor of these circumstances, the former capital was given the status of a Federal City (Bundesstadt). Bonn has developed into a center for international cooperation, particularly in the environmental and sustainable development spheres. In addition to a number of international organizations and institutions, such as the United Nations Center for Environmental Law on Nature Reserves (IUCN ELC), the city also hosts 18 United Nations agencies. Together, Bonn asserts itself as a center for national and international meetings, conventions and conferences, most of which relate directly to the work of the United Nations. A conference center capable of accommodating thousands of participants is currently under construction near the UN Campus. The city is home to the University of Bonn, one of the best higher education institutions in Germany. From 1597 to 1794, Bonn was the Electorate of Cologne and the residence of the Archbishops and Prince-electors of Cologne, and was the birthplace of the famous composer Ludwig van Beethoven in 1770.",

Sefer Beresyit\u200e) is the first book and part of the group of books of the Torah (or Pentateuch) in the Old Testament Christian Bible and Tanakh (or Hebrew Bible). This book tells about the creation of the world, the early history of mankind, the ancestors of Israel and the origin of the Jewish people. In the Jewish and Christian traditions, it is said that the Book of Genesis was written by Moses, as well as the Book of Exodus, Leviticus, and most of the contents of Deuteronomy. Modern scholarship, however, especially since the 19th century, considers the books to have been written in the 6th\u20135th century B.C.E., hundreds of years after the time Moses was supposed to have lived. Based on scientific interpretations of archaeological, genetic, and linguistic evidence, most scientists believe that the Book of Genesis is not historical fact but simply Judeo-Christian mythology. Within Judaism, the theological importance of the Book of Genesis is centered on the covenant linking God to His chosen people and His chosen people to the Promised Land. Christianity has interpreted the Book of Genesis as an early description of certain important faiths of Christianity, especially the need for salvation (the hope or assurance for all Christians) and Christ's atoning act on the Cross as the fulfillment of the covenant as the Son of God.

Divisions based on Bible facts This first section covers Genesis 1\u201311. This section presents the author's concept of divinity and the relationship between humans and their Creator. This section contains several toledot lists (\"history, genealogy\"), some in the form of narratives and some in the form of genealogies (descendants).

The second section called history covers Genesis 12\u201350. This section describes the prehistoric times of the Israelites, namely God's chosen nation, by telling their forefathers. Like the first part, this section also contains several toledot lists, which consist of the genealogy of Ishmael (25:12), the history of Isaac (25:19), the history and genealogy of Esau (36:1, 36:9), and the history of Jacob ( 37:2).

The democracy practiced at that time was direct democracy, meaning that the people's right to make political decisions was carried out directly by all the people or citizens. A democratic government is different from a form of government in which the power is held by one person, such as a monarchy. Derived from the Greek philosophy today seems ambiguous because some contemporary governments mix elements of democracy, oligarchy, and monarchy. Karl Popper defined democracy as distinct from dictatorship or tyranny, thus focusing on the opportunity for a society to control its dishonest or untrustworthy leaders and remove them without needing a revolution. There are several types of democracy, but only two basic forms. Both explain how all people carry out their wishes. The first form of democracy is direct democracy, in which all citizens play a direct and active role in making government decisions. In most modern democracies, the entire people is still a sovereign power but political power is exercised indirectly through representatives; so-called indirect democracy. A brief history Throughout its independence, the Indonesian nation has tried to implement various types of democracy. Until 1959, democratic practices were carried out which tended to be a Liberal Democracy system, as was the case in individualistic Western countries. In 1959-1966 Guided Democracy was implemented, which in practice tended to be authoritarian. Starting in 1966 until the end of the New Order period in 1998 Pancasila Democracy was implemented.

Proteins have many functions in living things, including accelerating metabolic reactions, replicating DNA, responding to stimuli, giving shape to cells and bodies, and moving molecules from one location to another. The main difference between one protein and another is the sequence of its amino acids, which is determined by the nucleotide sequence of its genes, and usually causes the folding of the protein into a special three-dimensional structure suited to its function. A number of amino acids form a straight chain called a polypeptide. A protein consists of at least one long polypeptide. Short polypeptides (with less than 20\u201330 amino acids) are not usually considered proteins, but are called peptide or oligopeptide molecules. Each amino acid in a protein is bound to a nearby amino acid by a peptide bond. The sequence of amino acids in a protein is determined by the sequence of genes encoded in the genetic code. In general, the genetic code produces a standard 20 amino acids, although some organisms have additional amino acids. Shortly after or even during synthesis, residues in proteins are often chemically modified through posttranslational modification processes that change the physical and chemical properties, folding, stability, activity, and function of the protein. Some proteins have nonpeptide (non-amino acid) groups, which can be called cofactors and prosthetic groups. Some proteins can also work together to carry out specific functions, and such groups often form stable protein complexes. Once formed, proteins exist only for a certain period of time and then are degraded and recycled within the cell through the process of protein turnover.

Abnormal or misfolded proteins degrade more rapidly, either because they are targeted for destruction or because they are unstable. Along with other giant biomolecules such as polysaccharides and nucleic acids, proteins are an essential part of organisms and are involved in almost all processes in cells. Some proteins are enzymes that function as catalysts in biochemical reactions and are vital for metabolism. Some proteins have a building or strengthening function, for example actin and myosin proteins in muscles and proteins in the cytoskeleton. Other proteins have important roles in cell signaling, immune response, cell adhesion, and cell cycle. Animals need protein in their diet to obtain essential amino acids that cannot be synthesized in the body. The digestive system breaks down protein from food to be used in metabolism. Proteins can be purified from other cellular components using various techniques such as ultracentrifugation, precipitation, electrophoresis and chromatography. Genetic engineering allows a number of methods to facilitate this purification. Methods commonly used to study protein structure and function are immunohistochemistry, site-directed mutagenesis, X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance, and mass spectrometry. Proteins were recognized as a group of biomolecules in the eighteenth century by Antoine Fourcroy and others, characterized by their ability to coagulate or flocculation under treatment with heat or acids. Examples recorded at that time were albumin from egg white, albumin in blood serum, fibrin, and wheat gluten. Proteins were first described by the Dutch chemist Gerardus Johannes Mulder and named by the Swedish chemist J\u00f6ns Jacob Berzelius in 1838.

It is relative to a set of standard solutions whose pH is determined by international agreement. The concept of pH was first introduced by the Danish chemist S\u00f8ren Peder Lauritz S\u00f8rensen in 1909. It is not known exactly what the abbreviated \"p\" means in \"pH\". Some references suggest that the p comes from the abbreviation for power (rank), others refer to the German word Potenz (which also means rank), and still others refer to the word potential. Jens Norby published a scholarly paper in 2000 arguing that p is a constant meaning \"negative logarithm\". Pure water is neutral, with its pH at 25\u00b0C defined as 7.0. Solutions with a pH less than 7 are said to be acidic, and solutions with a pH greater than 7 are said to be basic or alkaline. pH measurement is very important in fields related to life or the chemical processing industry such as chemistry, biology, medicine, agriculture, food science, engineering (engineering), and oceanography. Of course, other fields of science and technology also use it though at a lower frequency. pH is defined as the minus logarithm of the activity of hydrogen ions in an aqueous solution. pH is a dimensionless quantity. where aH is the hydrogen ion activity.

The potential difference across this glass electrode ideally follows the Nernst equation: where E is the measured potential, E0 is the standard electrode potential, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature in kelvins, F is the Faraday constant, and n is the number of electrons transferred. The electrode potential E is directly proportional to the logarithm of the hydrogen ion activity. This definition is inherently impractical because the hydrogen ion activity is the product of the concentration times the activity coefficient. The activity coefficient of a single hydrogen ion cannot be calculated experimentally. To overcome this, the electrode is calibrated with a solution whose activity is known. The operational definition of pH is formally defined by International Standard ISO 31-8 as follows: For a solution X, first measure the electromotive force EX of the galvanic cell and then measure the electromotive force ES of the galvanic cell which differs only on replacement of solution X of unknown pH with a solution of S whose pH (standard) is known as pH(S). The pH of solution X is therefore the difference between the pH of solution X and the pH of a standard solution depends only on the difference between the two measured potentials. Thus, pH is obtained from potential measurements with electrodes calibrated to one or more pH standards. A pH meter is adjusted so that the meter reading for a standard solution is equal to the pH(S) value. The pH(S) values \u200b\u200bfor various S standard solutions are given by IUPAC recommendations.

Samadhi is also the highest phase in the eight phases of Yoga mastery. When entering the samadhi phase, analytical and logical faculties become dysfunctional or stagnant. According to the Bhargava Dictionary, Samadhi is the strongest phase of yoga in which a person gains the power to suspend the connection between body and soul for as long as He likes. Samadhi is also understood as a part of religious ritual, as opposed to meditation or meditation, both of which are concentration training practices used outside of religious rituals. In terms of awareness, it is described that samadhi emphasizes non-duality, in which the subject's consciousness becomes one with the object experienced or that exists outside of it, and at this very moment the mind becomes still, focused on one thing or concentrated while one remains aware. Whereas in Buddhism, it can also refer to a submissive state in which the mind becomes very still and completely disengaged with the object of attention, thereby gaining insight and a stream of changes regarding experience. The word samadhi is first used in Sanskrit literature in the Maitri Upanishad. The word samadhi itself generally means \"concentration\" or \"not distracted\", while in terms of raising awareness by doing meditation. Then, we traced the etymology of the word originating from the Pali language which is a combination of the prefix sam (meaning \"unity\" or \"integration\"), a (\"toward\"), and finally dha (\"achievement of goals or intellect\").

In addition, this term can also be interpreted as uniformity (sam) and determination (dhi) which means to determine oneself to be fully uniform in one's true self-awareness. So from this etymology it can be concluded that samadhi is an attempt to obtain the whole, the goal, or the truth (samapatti). In Hinduism, Samadhi is part of the religious ritual procedures described in the Yoga Sutras in the first chapter entitled Samadhi-pada. Likewise, Vyasa, an influential figure in Hinduism and also the author of the Mahabharata, explained that samadhi is the same as yoga from a practical point of view. In addition, Hindu teachings also do not only emphasize the concept of samadhi as a state of peace without content, but rather a person changes his consciousness to focus on feeling happy and serene following the flow of life. In Hindu teachings, samadhi is divided into five levels: laya samadhi, savikalpa samadhi, nirvikalpa samadhi, sahaja samadhi, and mahasamadhi. At the first level of laya samadhi one recognizes for the first time the form of peace and happiness through singing, dancing, or other daily activities. In this phase a person begins to grow and recognize the potential talent within him to continue samadhi to the next level. In the second level, savikalpa samadhi, the meditator will experience the sensations of space and time travel differently. During these periods of samadhi, the meditator tries to understand the consummation of samadhi. All kinds of feelings and thoughts flooded into his mind, but he consciously put them out. The third is Nirvikalpa Samadhi, in which the yogi will experience the pinnacle of great bliss. He felt as if the world and everything in it was following him.",

The alleged answer is a temporary truth, which will be verified by data collected through research. The scientific hypothesis tries to express a temporary answer to the problem to be studied. The hypothesis becomes tested if all the symptoms that arise do not contradict the hypothesis. In an effort to prove the hypothesis, the researcher may deliberately cause or create a symptom. This intention is called a trial or experiment. A hypothesis that has been tested for truth is called a theory. Example: The hypothesis comes from the Greek: hypo = under; thesis = establishment, upheld opinion, certainty. That is, the hypothesis is a scientific term used in the context of scientific activities that follow the rules of ordinary thinking, consciously, thoroughly and purposefully. In everyday use this hypothesis is often also called a hypothesis, there is no difference in meaning in it. When thinking on a daily basis, people often refer to a hypothesis as an assumption, estimate, conjecture, and so on. Hypothesis also means a statement or proposition which says that among a number of facts there is a certain relationship. This proposition will shape the process of forming a hypothesis in research, one of which is social research. The process of forming a hypothesis is a reasoning process, which goes through certain stages. This also happens in making scientific hypotheses, which are done consciously, thoroughly, and purposefully. Thus, it can be said that a hypothesis is a type of proposition that can be directly tested. Hypothesis is an important element in scientific research, especially quantitative research.

This is the same as descriptive research, some argue that it does not use hypotheses because it only makes descriptions or measures carefully about the phenomenon under study, but there are also those who think descriptive research can use hypotheses. Meanwhile, in explanatory research that aims to explain the relationship between variables, it is imperative to use a hypothesis. The important function of the hypothesis in research, namely: One hypothesis can be tested if the hypothesis is formulated correctly. Failure to formulate a hypothesis will obscure the research results. Even though the hypothesis has met the requirements proportionally, if the hypothesis is still abstract it not only confuses the research procedure, but also is difficult to test in real terms. To be able to formulate a good and correct hypothesis, at least it must have several main characteristics, namely: The stages of forming a hypothesis are generally as follows: This hypothesis is a type of proposition that is formulated as a tentative answer to a problem and then tested empirically. As a type of proposition, hypotheses generally state the relationship between two or more variables in which the relationship statements have been formulated in a theoretical framework. This hypothesis is derived from, or derived from, theories and literature reviews related to the problem to be studied. The statement of the relationship between variables, as formulated in the hypothesis, is only a temporary assumption of a problem based on the relationship that has been described in the theoretical framework used to explain the research problem. Because, the right theory will produce the right hypothesis to be used as a temporary answer to the problem being researched or studied in research.",

Etymologically, the term empiricism comes from the Greek emperia, which means experience. In empiricism, truth can only be obtained through experience. The empiricist mindset relies on empirical evidence. Empiricism is a type of ontology. In empiricism, humans can gain knowledge from experience by observing and sensing. Empiricism is one of the three schools of philosophy of science in the Western world. Philosophical thinking on empiricism has a nature that is contrary to rationalism. Empiricism thought was pioneered by Thomas Hobbes as a reaction against rationalism. The development of empiricism thought took place rapidly in England and the surrounding area during the renaissance during the 17th to 18th centuries. Empiricism was first developed in England by John Locke (1632\u20131704), but has more influenced thinkers in the United States, especially in the fields of environmental preservation and environmental psychology. Supporting figures come from adherents of Western philosophy, including Francis Bacon, Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, and David Hume. The empiricism of its leaders has contributed to the development of the scientific field. These figures include John Locke (social science and scientific method), George Berkeley (physics, mathematics and theology), and David Hume (historical science and science). Empiricism is also the basis for the development of philosophy in positivism. In addition, empiricism is also one of the main streams in educational philosophy which is the basis for the development of various models of education in the world. The understanding of empiricism has been put forward by Aristotle with the opinion that perception is the basis of science.

The laws of mechanism are considered as the basis of the processes that take place in the world, including humans. Then, another idea about empiricism was put forward by John Locke (1632\u20131704) who argued that the source of knowledge received by reason comes from experience. The empiricism of thought was further developed by George Berkeley who argued that material substances do not exist at all, only observable characteristics exist. When the world entered the Industrial Revolution, humans began to rely on science and technology to determine policies to address various social problems in society. Mysticism and beliefs about the occult and magic have begun to be abandoned by society. Social problems began to be solved by compiling and testing various scientific theories. The benchmarks used are empiricism and the scientific method. The main teachings of empiricism can be divided based on their views on sources of knowledge, methods of thinking and models of reasoning used. The source of knowledge in the view of empiricism is only from experience. The method of thinking he uses is through empirical evidence and experiments. While the reasoning model he uses is inductive reasoning. The main teachings of empiricism are contrary to rationalism, because rationalism considers knowledge recognition by the senses to be unclear. Meanwhile, empiricism believes that the senses are the perfect and clearest means of recognizing knowledge. In another sense, empiricism prioritizes the use of a posteriori elements, while rationalism prioritizes the use of a priori elements. Another difference between empiricism and rationalism lies in the type of mindset used. Empiricism uses an inductive mindset, while rationalism uses a deductive mindset. The epistemological view of empiricism is based on the principle that everything that exists in the mind exists in the form of sensory data.",

Animals range from 8.5 micrometers to 33.6 meters in length and have complex interactions with one another and with their environment, as well as forming intricate food webs. The study of animals is called zoology. Most of the living animal species are classified in the Bilateria, a clade whose members have a bilaterally symmetrical body shape. The Bilateria includes protostomes and deuterostomes. Within the protostomes there are many groups of invertebrates, such as nematodes, arthropods, and molluscs, while the deuterostomes include echinoderms and chordates (including vertebrates).

So, education means the activity of \"leading out\". Any experience that has a formative effect on the way people think, feel, or act can be considered educational. Education is generally divided into stages such as preschool, elementary school, junior high school, high school, and then college, university or apprenticeship. A right to education has been recognized by several governments. At the global level, Article 13 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights recognizes the right of everyone to education. Although education is compulsory in most places up to a certain age, attending school is often not practiced, and a minority of parents opt for home-schooling, e-learning or similar education for their children. Education usually begins when a baby is born and lasts a lifetime. Education could have started before the baby was born as many people do by playing music and reading to babies in the womb with the hope that he can teach their babies before birth.

In the 19th century, a person who liked to dress up both men and women was seen as feminine but by modern standards was called feminine. Ronald F. Levant in his book Masculinity Reconstructed explains that there are distinctive traits in someone who is considered masculine, including avoiding femininity, limiting emotions, ambitious, independent, strong and aggressive. These traits reinforce gender roles that are grouped according to male or female sex because most men are masculine. On the other hand, most women are feminine. The study of masculinity received increased attention in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In the United States, masculinity courses increased from 30 to more than 300 courses. This has sparked various studies on masculinity and in the end this field has developed more broadly. The birth of theories of social discrimination, social construction and gender differences is a development of this field of study. However, it should be noted that masculinity and femininity are not concepts with a single category dimension. There are different forms of masculinity and femininity.

However, with the emergence of androgyny studies, feminist experts argue that the definition of gender has obscured gender classification.

Behavior outside the standards set by tradition in certain cultures can be considered as an indication of homosexuality for men and lesbian for women.

Damage to the environment occurs due to two factors, either natural factors or due to the ignorant hands of humans. The importance of a well-maintained environment is sometimes forgotten by humans, and this can result in ecosystems and life that are not optimal in that environment. The following are some of the in-depth factors that cause environmental damage: The number of natural disasters and erratic weather is the cause of environmental damage. These natural disasters can be in the form of floods, landslides, tsunamis, tornadoes, hurricanes, volcanic eruptions, or earthquakes. Besides being dangerous for the safety of humans and other creatures, this disaster will damage the environment. Humans as intelligent beings and have high abilities compared to other creatures will continue to develop from a simple lifestyle to a modern life. With the development of life, of course, their needs will also greatly develop, including the need for excessive exploitation of natural resources. Environmental damage due to the human factor can be in the form of illegal logging which causes floods or landslides, and dumping garbage anywhere, especially rivers and seas, will create pollution. Institutionally in Indonesia, the agency that regulates environmental issues is the Ministry of Environment and Forestry of the Republic of Indonesia (formerly: State Minister of Population and Environment) and in the regions or provinces it is Bapedal.

The city of Palembang and several of its neighboring regencies (Banyuasin Regency, Ogan Ilir Regency and Ogan Komering Ilir Regency) were developed by the central government as a metropolitan area in Indonesia with an area called the Great Statue or Great Palembang. The history of Palembang, which was once the capital of the largest Buddhist maritime empire in Southeast Asia at that time, the Sriwijaya Empire, which dominated the archipelago and the Malay Peninsula in the 9th century, also made this city known as the \"Bumi Sriwijaya\".

One version is that when the Sriwijaya rulers founded a Wanua (city) which is now known as Palembang City; The topography of Palembang city is surrounded by water and even submerged by water. The water comes from tributaries and swamps, even according to statistical data for 1990, Palembang still has 50% of the land that is inundated by water (swamps). It is possible that because of this topographical condition, the ancestors of the Palembang people named this city as Palembang, which means Pa or Pe as a place or situation, and Lembang or Lembeng means low ground, root valleys that swell because they have been submerged in water for a long time (according to the Malay dictionary), while according to the Palembang Malay language, a lembang or lembeng is a pool of water.",

The differences in question are individual differences with other individuals or differences in adopted values, such as differences in systems, culture, religion, habits, and politics. Multiculturalism is related to culture and the possibility of its concept being limited by value content or having certain interests. Multiculturalism contrasts with monoculturalism and assimilation which have been the norm in the nation-state paradigm since the early 19th century. Monoculturalism requires normative cultural unity (the term 'monocultural' can also be used to describe pre-existing homogeneity). Meanwhile, assimilation is the desire to unite between two or more different cultures by reducing differences. thus creating a new culture.Multiculturalism began to be made official policy in English-speaking countries, starting in Africa in 1999. This policy was later adopted by most members of the European Union, as official policy, and as social consensus among the elite.citation needed] In recent years, however, a number of European countries, notably the UK and France, have begun to shift their policies towards multiculturalism, a change in policy that has also become the subject of debate in the UK and Germany, among other countries. kind of meaning and to The trend towards the development of concepts and practices of multiculturalism expressed by experts has made a character named Parekh (1997:183-185) distinguish five kinds of multiculturalism (Azra, 2007, summarizing Parekh's description): Indonesian society is a society with a very complex level of diversity. Societies with various diversity are known as multicultural societies. If we know society as a group of people who have lived and worked together long enough so that they are able to organize themselves and think of themselves as a social unit with certain boundaries (Linton), then the concept of society when combined with multiculturalism has a very broad meaning. and a deep understanding is needed to be able to understand what a multicultural society really is.",

So that a multicultural society can be interpreted as a group of people who live and live permanently in a place that has its own culture and characteristics that are able to distinguish one society from another. Each society will produce its own culture which will become the hallmark of that society. This is where the term multiculturalism comes from. There are many definitions of multiculturalism, including multiculturalism which is basically a worldview which can then be translated into various cultural policies which emphasize acceptance of the reality of diversity, plurality and multiculturalism in people's lives. Multiculturalism can also be understood as a world view which is then embodied in the \"politics of recognition\" (Azyumardi Azra, 2007). Lawrence Blum revealed that multiculturalism includes an understanding, appreciation, and assessment of one's culture, as well as respect and curiosity about other people's ethnic cultures. The various understandings of multiculturalism can be concluded that the essence of multiculturalism is about acceptance and appreciation of a culture, both one's own culture. and other people's culture. Everyone is emphasized to respect each other and respect every culture that exists in society. Whatever form a culture has, it must be accepted by everyone without discriminating between one culture and another. Basically, multiculturalism that is formed in Indonesia is the result of socio-cultural and geographical conditions that are so diverse and broad. According to geographical conditions, Indonesia has many islands where each island is inhabited by a group of people who form a society. From this society a culture is formed about the community itself. Of course this has an impact on the existence of very many and varied cultures.",

Elephants are distributed throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. Elephantidae is the only extant family of the order Proboscidea; other families now extinct include mammoths and mastodons. The male African elephant is the largest land animal with a height of up to 4 m and a mass that can also reach 7,000 kg. Elephants have special features, and the most striking is the trunk or proboscis which is used for many things, especially for breathing, sucking water, and picking up objects. The incisors grow into canines which can be used as weapons and tools for moving objects or digging. Their large ears help regulate their body temperature. African elephants have larger ears and a concave back, while Asian elephants have smaller ears and a convex back. Elephants are herbivorous animals that can be found in various habitats, such as savannas, forests, deserts and swamps. They tend to be near water. Elephants are considered a keystone species because of their impact on the environment.

The calf is the center of attention of the family group and is dependent on its mother for about three years. Elephants can live for 70 years in the wild. They communicate by touch, sight, smell, and sound; elephants also use infrasound and seismic communication over long distances. The intelligence of elephants has been compared to that of primates and cetaceans. They appear to be self-aware and show empathy for other elephants who are near or have died. The African elephant is classified as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), while the Asian elephant is classified as a threatened species. One of the biggest threats to elephants is the ivory trade which fuels poaching. Another threat is habitat destruction and conflicts with local residents. On the other hand, elephants are used as working animals in Asia. Once they were used for war; today, elephants are often exhibited in zoos and circuses. Elephants are easily recognizable and have been depicted in art, folklore, religion, literature and popular culture. In Indonesian, Javanese, Sundanese, Minangkabau and Acehnese, this animal is called \"elephant\". The word itself comes from the Sanskrit word, \"gaja\", which is the root of the masculine noun.

This doctrine is attributed to Nestorius (c. 386\u2013c. 451), Patriarch of Constantinople. This view of Christ was condemned at the Council of Ephesus in 431, and conflict over this view resulted in the Nestorian Schism, which separated the Assyrian Church of the East from the Byzantine Church. The Assyrian Church of the East refused to withdraw support for Nestorius and refused to label him a heretic, so this Church was henceforth called the \"Nestorian Church\" by the Western Church, to distinguish it from other ancient Eastern Churches. Nevertheless, the Assyrian Eastern Church actually does not consider its Church doctrine to be Nestorian, but teaches the view of Babai Agung, that Christ has two qnomes (essences) that do not mix and are eternally united in one parsopa (personality). According to some interpretations, the origin of this belief is largely historical and linguistic: for example, the Greek has two words for 'person', which are not properly translated into Syriac, and the meanings of these terms are not even established at the time. life of Nestorius. Nestorianism emerged in the Church in the 5th century as a result of attempts to rationally explain and understand the incarnation of the Divine Logos, the Second Person of the Most Holy Trinity, as the man Jesus Christ. Nestorianism taught that the human essence and the divine essence of Christ were separate and therefore there were two persons, namely the human person Jesus Christ, and the divine Logos person, who dwelt in the man Jesus Christ.

Nestorius (c. 386\u2013c. 451) was a pupil of Theodorus of Mopsuestia in Antioch, Syria (now in Turkey) and later became Patriarch of Constantinople. He taught that the human and divine aspects of Christ were distinct, not one, attributes. He preached against using the title Mother of God (Theotokos) for the Virgin Mary and calling her only the Mother of Christ (Kristotokos). He also argued that God could not suffer on the cross, because God is omnipotent. Therefore, the human part of Christ died on the cross, but not the divine part. His opponents accused him of dividing Christ into two persons: they argued that God the Word did not suffer suffering and died on the cross, while Jesus the man did, or claimed God the Word was omniscient, while Jesus the man had limited knowledge, means that there are two separate persons having separate experiences. In response, Nestorius said that he believed Christ was truly one person (Greek: prosopon). Opposed by Cyril of Alexandria, Nestorius was finally condemned at the Council of Ephesus in 431. The council taught that Christ is one person, and that the Virgin Mary is the Mother of God.

Changes to the rules regarding the prohibition of the distribution of liquor in 1933 stopped this illegal distribution effort which at the same time made entrepreneurs and drivers who had already modified cars look for other ways so that what they had done to their cars would not end up in vain.

The synthesis appeared around 500\u2013200 BC, and coexisted with Buddhism until the 8th century. From North India, the \"Hindu Synthesis\" spread south, to parts of Southeast Asia. This is supported by Sanskritization. Since the 19th century, under the domination of Western colonialism and Indology (when the term \"Hinduism\" came into widespread use), Hinduism was reaffirmed as a place for a coherent and independent collection of various traditions.

Sport is a physical activity that is intentional and planned starting from the direction, purpose, time and location. In social life, sport is a phenomenon as well as a form of human expression. Sports can be done individually or in groups. Another definition, sport is a competitive activity that involves physical and mental abilities, in which there must be rules in the game. So that in a sports competition there will be winners and losers. Sports that involve physical ability as a major controller in influencing the outcome of the game include football, basketball, badminton, and others. While sports that do not involve too much physical abilities, include card games and chess. The involvement of sports in human life occurred about 3000 years ago. At that time, sports were used to support training for soldiers in preparation for war. Some sports such as javelin throwing and discus throwing are adaptations of sports in ancient times. Over time, sports have developed and formed various types of sports. The Pharaoh Monument, located in Egypt, shows the development of the sport in running as represented by Zoser participating in a running race during the festival. The first sporting Olympics were held in 776 BC (BC) by the ancient Greeks. At that time, the Olympics could only be followed by Greek men, especially those who were free from slavery. In 1896, the first modern Olympics were held in Athens, Greece under the leadership of Pierre de Coubertin. The following is an incomplete list of sports that are still contested in the modern era. Sport is very beneficial for the health of the body.",

Lutetium is a white and silver mixed metal that is resistant to corrosion and is a rare earth product. Lutetium is the hardest and densest metal in the lanthanide group, which is located in the last column of the group on the periodic table. Lutetium was first discovered in 1907 by Baron Carl Auer von Welsbach, Georges Urbain, and Charles James while each of them was conducting research in different locations. They examined a mineral thought to consist purely of ytterbium, but in the end it was discovered that this mineral was also a combination of lutetium and several other chemical elements. Because Georges Urbain took the swift step to publicize his discovery, the naming of the chemical element lutetium was chosen and officially recognized globally. Lutetium has the atomic number 71 and the electron configuration Xe] 4f145d16s2. Lutetium is resistant to corrosion and is a mixture of white and silver in color. The atomic mass of lutetium is large compared to its size, so it has high boiling and melting points. Actually, the electrons of the element lutetium do not completely fill the d orbitals, but are still classified as lanthanides because they have physical and chemical characteristics that are very similar to the 14 other chemical elements of the lanthanide group. Lutetium has 59 isotopes, but only two are stable, namely Lu-175 and Lu-176. 97.41% of the total lutetium found on earth is Lu-175, while only 2.59% is Lu-176. Although less abundant and radioactive, elemental Lu-176 can last for 4x1010 years. In real life, lutetium can be obtained from minerals containing a mixture of lutetium and other lanthanide group chemical elements.",

Mechanics is a very important part of physics, especially for scientists and engineers. Mechanics also means the science that studies the force of motion of an object and the effects of the force it produces. Broadly speaking, the branch of mechanics is divided into two, namely statics and dynamics. While the dynamics can also be divided into two into kinematics and kinetics. Early thought about mechanics dates back to the time of Aristotle (384\u2013322 BC). The earliest field of mechanics was celestial mechanics. Aristotle in his time considered the Earth as a stationary object with the stars that revolve around it experiencing movement or rotation. Aristotle's thought was further developed by an astronomer named Tycho Brahe in the 16th century AD and further developed by his student named Johannes Kepler in the early 17th century AD. The laws of mechanics were only scientifically formulated in the early 17th century AD by Isaac Newton from empirical evidence found by Brahe and Kepler. The basic concepts put forward by Newton were force and mass, which were later developed again into the theory of gravity. The science of mechanics then continued to be developed in the second half of the 17th century AD to the first half of the 19th century AD. Its developers include Johann Bernoulli, Jean le Rond d'Alembert, Joseph-Louis de Lagrange and William Rowan Hamilton. At this time, mechanics was known as classical mechanics, theoretical mechanics or analytic mechanics. From this classical mechanics, the science of mechanics which is more complicated and related to modern physics, namely wave mechanics, statistical mechanics, and quantum mechanics develops.",

Mechanics is included in the scientific field of physics, so the units used are related to physical mechanical quantities. In mechanics, the units used are length, mass, and time. The unit systems used in mechanics are the MKS unit system and the CGS unit system. The following are classified as classical mechanics: Fluid mechanics is a branch of mechanics that studies the motion of fluids. This movement is observed in both liquid and gaseous forms. Fluid mechanics also studies fluids that are not in a state of motion or rest. Much of what is discussed in fluid mechanics deals with continuum mechanics. Broadly speaking, fluid mechanics is divided into fluid statics, which studies fluids at rest, and fluid dynamics, which studies fluids in motion. Especially in fluid dynamics, mathematical approaches and complicated empirical evidence are used to solve problems. Soil mechanics is a field of science that combines several branches of mechanics with the aim of studying soil and its components to carry out construction activities. In practical applications, soil mechanics is used in civil engineering to predict soil performance characteristics. In its application, soil mechanics uses statics techniques, dynamics techniques, fluid mechanics, and other technologies to analyze soil structure. Major studies in soil mechanics include the study of soil composition, strength, consolidation, and the use of hydraulic principles. The benefit of soil mechanics is to reduce and overcome engineering geology problems caused by the presence and properties of sedimentary rocks and other depositional reactions. Meanwhile, engineers utilize the theory of soil mechanics for building construction engineering purposes, planning equipment and supporting materials and managing the type of work required.",

        "paragraph": "Enzymes are biomolecules in the form of proteins that function as catalysts (compounds that speed up the reaction process without being finished reacting) in an organic chemical reaction. Enzymes function as biocatalysts of a chemical reaction. The energy required by enzymes in chemical reactions is very small so that it functions to lower the activation energy. The initial molecule called the substrate will be accelerated to change into another molecule called the product. All biological processes of the cell require enzymes in order to proceed quickly enough in a certain direction of metabolic pathway. Enzymes work by reacting with substrate molecules to produce intermediate compounds through an organic chemical reaction that requires a lower activation energy, so that the acceleration of chemical reactions occurs because chemical reactions with higher activation energies take longer. For example: Although the catalyst compound may change in the initial reaction, in the final reaction the catalyst molecule will return to its original shape. Most enzymes work uniquely, which means that each type of enzyme can only work on one type of chemical compound or reaction. This is due to differences in the chemical structure of each enzyme which is fixed. For example, the \u03b1-amylase enzyme can only be used in the process of breaking down starch into glucose. Enzyme work is influenced by several factors, especially the substrate, temperature, acidity, cofactors and inhibitors. Each enzyme requires a different optimum temperature and pH (acidity level) because enzymes are proteins, which can change shape if the temperature and acidity change. Outside the appropriate temperature or pH, enzymes cannot work optimally or their structure will be damaged. This will cause the enzyme to lose its function completely. Enzyme work is also influenced by other molecules. Inhibitors are molecules that decrease enzyme activity, while activators are those that increase enzyme activity.",

At least in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, several processes involving enzymes were known, namely the digestion of meat by gastric secretions and the breakdown of starch into sugars by plant extracts and saliva. However, the mechanisms by which these processes occur have not been identified. French chemist Anselme Payen was the first scientist to discover an enzyme, namely diastase, in 1833. Decades later, Louis Pasteur, who was researching the fermentation of sugar into alcohol using yeast, wrote that this fermentation reaction was caused by a \"vital force\" contained in yeast cells, referred to as \"ferment\", according to which it only functions in the body of living organisms. He wrote that \"alcoholic fermentation is an action related to the life and order of the yeast cells, and not to their death or decay.\" In 1878, the German physiologist Wilhelm K\u00fchne (1837\u20131900) first used the term \"enzyme\", which comes from the Greek \u03b5\u03bd\u03b6\u03c5\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd meaning \"in leavening agent\" or \"in yeast\", to describe this process. The word \"enzyme\" (enzyme) was later used to refer to inanimate substances such as pepsin, and the word ferment was used to refer to chemical activities produced by living organisms. In 1897, Eduard Buchner began his series of scientific papers on yeast extract. In experiments at the University of Berlin, he found that the fermentation of sugar by yeast extract continued even if there were no surviving yeast cells in the mixture. He named the enzyme that triggers this fermentation of sucrose \"zymase\" (zimase). In 1907, he received the Nobel Prize in chemistry for \"discovering cellless fermentation\".

Derrida degrades the role of language which according to him is just \"writing\" which does not force its users, he also sees that social institutions are nothing but writing, because they are unable to force people. Different contexts give words with different meanings. As a result, the language system does not have coercive power over people, which according to the views of structuralist theorists does. Therefore, according to Derrida, it is impossible for scientists to discover the general laws that underlie language. He criticized society in general for being enslaved by logocentrism (the search for a universal system of thinking that expresses what is right, right, beautiful and so on). Poststructuralism contains both criticism and absorption. Absorbing various aspects of structural linguistics while making it a critique that is considered capable of transcending structuralism. In short, poststructuralism rejects the idea of \u200b\u200ba stable structure that underlies meaning through binary (black-and-white, good-bad) pairs. Meaning is something that is unstable, which always slips in the process, not only limited to certain single words, sentences or texts, but the result of relationships between texts.

The concepts of the subconscious, ego, fear of castration by the father, and Freud's process of identification underlie Lacan's thinking. In an effort to revisit the theory of subjectivity derived from the work of Sigmund Freud, Lacan rereads Freud to clarify and enliven a set of concepts, especially that of the unconscious. The theory about the ego in humans which gives rise to the human unconscious extends to various social and human fields. In America and other English-speaking countries it thrived under the influence of Heinze Hartman. In the period after the great war, the humanism movement became important, and an understanding emerged of the importance of human consciousness, a belief that the ego, good or bad, is at the center of human psychic life. With a structuralist emphasis on language as a system of differences without positive meaning, Lacan highlights the importance of language in Freud's work. However, before the structuralist approach became popular, in 1936 Lacan had developed a mirror image theory which spoke of the ability of babies aged 6-18 months (no voice) to be able to recognize their own reflection in a mirror. The act of self-knowledge does not become self-evident by itself, this is because the baby will see the image either as himself or not (only a reflected image). At that age, the baby does not yet have the concept of self-awareness, then at a later age -after he begins to speak, it is called a marker of self-awareness. Thus, the formation of the ego takes place, that is the center of consciousness. In 1953, Lacan in the Roman Discourse said, \"Man speaks,... but it is the symbol that makes him human.\" Foucault is both a body sociologist and a post-structuralist theorist.",

Bridges are often a critical component of a road section, because it determines the maximum load of vehicles passing through the road. The first bridge was made with a wooden footbridge to cross the river. There are also people who use two ropes or rattan, which are tied to the rocks by the river. Henceforth, stone was still used, but only as a frame. The first arched bridges were built during the time of the Roman Empire, and there are still many bridges and aqueducts of the Romans that we know today. The Romans also had the knowledge to know the difference in the strength of different stones. The brick and mortar bridges were built during the time of the Roman emperors, because after that time, knowledge technology was lost.

Sometimes there are limitations in the use of bridges; for example, there are bridges that are dedicated to roads and cannot be used by pedestrians or cyclists. There are also bridges built for pedestrians (crossing bridges), and can be used for cyclists. Half the bridge is made higher than necessary, so that the reflection of the bridge will complete a circle. This kind of bridge, which is often found in oriental gardens, is called \"Bridge of the Moon\", because the bridge and its reflection resemble a full moon.

In Sri Lanka, Arahat Mahinda founded the Mah\u0101vih\u0101ra Monastery in Anuradhapura. During most of the early history of Buddhism in Sri Lanka, three branches of Theravada existed in Sri Lanka, consisting of monks from the Mah\u0101vih\u0101ra, Abhayagiri Vih\u0101ra, and Jetavana Vih\u0101ra. The Mah\u0101vih\u0101ra was the first tradition to be founded, while the Abhayagiri Vih\u0101ra and Jetavana Vih\u0101ra were founded by monks who had broken away from the Mah\u0101vih\u0101ra tradition.

Glucose is one of the main products of photosynthesis and the start of respiration. Its natural form (D-glucose) is also called dextrose, especially in the food industry. Glucose (C6H12O6, molecular weight 180.18) is a hexose\u2014a monosaccharide containing six carbon atoms. Glucose is an aldehyde (contains -CHO group). Its five carbons and one oxygen form a ring called a \"pyranose ring\", the most stable form for six-carbon aldoses. In this ring, each carbon is bonded to a hydroxyl and hydrogen side group except the fifth atom, which is bonded to the sixth carbon on the outside of the ring, forming a CH2OH group. This ring structure is in equilibrium with the more reactive form, which accounts for 0.0026% at pH 7. Glucose is a ubiquitous energy source in biology. We can surmise the reason why glucose, and not other monosaccharides such as fructose, is so widely used. Glucose can be formed from formaldehyde under abiotic conditions, making it readily available to primitive biochemical systems. Of more importance to higher organisms is the tendency for glucose, compared with other hexose sugars, to react nonspecifically with the amino groups of proteins. This reaction (glycosylation) reduces or even impairs the function of various enzymes. The low rate of glycosylation is due to glucose being mostly in less reactive cyclic isomers. However, acute complications such as diabetes, blindness, kidney failure, and peripheral nerve damage (''peripheral neuropathy''), may be caused by protein glycosylation. In respiration, through a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions, glucose is oxidized to finally form carbon dioxide and water, producing energy, mainly in the form of ATP.

On Earth, gravity causes physical objects to have weight, the Moon's gravity causes sea tides, and the sun's gravity causes planets and various other objects to be in their respective orbits in the solar system. The gravitational force of the matter in space that exists in the universe caused this matter to begin to gather, forming stars and causing these stars to gather to form galaxies so that it can be said that the large-scale structures in the universe were created by gravity. Gravity has an infinite range of values. However, the effect gets weaker the further away an object is. Modern physics most accurately describes gravity using the general theory of relativity proposed by Albert Einstein in 1915, which describes gravity not as a force, but as the consequence of mass moving \"straight\" in a curvature of space-time caused by the unequal distribution of mass. . The most extreme example of this curvature of space-time is a black hole, in which nothing, not even light, can escape once it passes through the black hole's event horizon. However, for most cases, gravity can be explained by Newton's simpler law of universal gravitation. Newton described gravity as a force that causes two physical objects to attract each other, with a force proportional to the resulting mass and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the two objects. Several theories that have not been proven yet state that the gravitational force arises because of the graviton particles in each atom.",

The island of Mauritius was discovered by the Portuguese in 1505, and first colonized by the Dutch in 1638. The Dutch named the island \"Mauritius\" in memory of Prince Maurice of Nassau. The French controlled the island throughout the 18th century and then named it Ile de France. Mauritius was annexed by the United Kingdom in 1810 and reverted to its former name. Independence was achieved in 1968 with a republican government that was included in the group of Commonwealth of Nations in 1992. Mauritius is a relatively stable democracy with regular elections and a good human rights record. The large influx of foreign investment into Mauritius has made it one of the countries with the highest per capita income in Africa. Together with Reunion and Rodrigues, Mauritius forms part of the Mascarene Islands. The islands were formed by an underwater volcanic explosion as the African Plate moved toward the Reunion hotspot. Mauritius and Rodrigues formed 8-10 million years ago. The two mountains are no longer active and the hotspot now resides beneath Reunion. The island of Mauritius itself is formed around a central plateau, with the highest peak Piton de la Riviere Noire (828m). Around the plateau, the original krater can still be distinguished from the other mountains.

Titanium was discovered in Cornwall, United Kingdom in 1791 by William Gregor and named by Martin Heinrich Klaproth from the Greek mythological Titan. This element is present among the deposits of various minerals, including rutile and ilmenite, which are abundant in the earth's crust and lithosphere, as well as in almost all living things, rocks, water and soil. The metal is extracted from its mineral ores via the Kroll process or the Hunter process. Its most common compound, titanium dioxide, is a common photocatalyst and is used in the manufacture of white pigments. Other compounds are titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4), a smoke screen component and catalyst; and titanium trichloride (TiCl3), used as a catalyst in the production of polypropylene. Titanium can be used as an alloy with iron, aluminum, vanadium, and molybdenum, to produce strong yet light alloys for aviation (jet engines, missiles, and space probes), military, industrial processes (chemical and petrochemical, desalination plants, pulp, and paper), automotive, agro-industry, medical devices, orthopedic implants, dentist tools and instruments, dental implants, sports equipment, jewelry, mobile phones, and many other applications. The two most useful properties of titanium are its corrosion resistance and the highest strength-to-density ratio of any metal. In its pure state, titanium is as strong as some steels, but lighter.

Because of their high oxidation number, titanium(IV) compounds have high covalent bonding properties. Unlike other transition metals, the aquo Ti(IV) complex is unknown. The most important oxide is TiO2, which exists in 3 polymorphs; anatase, brookite, and rutile. All three are white diamagnetic solids, although some samples are dark (see rutile). Titanate usually refers to titanium(IV) compounds, such as barium titanate (BaTiO3). With a perovskite structure, this material has piezoelectric properties and is used as a transducer in the interconversion of sound and electricity. Many minerals are titanates, such as ilmenite (FeTiO3). Star sapphires and rubies have asteristic properties from the presence of titanium dioxide in them. Several kinds of reduced oxides of titanium are known. Ti3O5 is a purple semiconductor produced by the reduction of TiO2 with hydrogen at high temperatures, and is used in industry when a surface needs to be vapor-coated with titanium dioxide: it evaporates as pure TiO, while TiO2 evaporates as a mixed oxide and deposit coating. with varying refractive indices.

The term \"inquisition\" comes from the Latin word Middle Ages, inquisitio. This word is used to refer to all kinds of judicial processes based on Roman law which were slowly revived in the Late Middle Ages. The term \"Inquisition\" is now used as a designation for a number of institutions to control heresy (as well as other violations of canon law) within the judicial system of the Roman Catholic Church. Although the plural is used as a designation for Catholic ecclesiastical courts, the term \"Inquisition\" actually refers to a judicial process, not an organization.

Cooper's Eagle is best at catching quail and cottontail rabbits, but larger females may occasionally catch quail. The kestrel can catch its prey by grabbing it with its claws and kill by gripping it tightly and haphazardly and tearing its prey's vital parts. Most of the action takes place on the ground and in certain species, such as the rabbit hawk, it will chase its prey down the hole.

        "paragraph": "Soil (Greek: pedon; Latin: solum) is that part of the earth's crust composed of minerals and organic matter. Soil has a very vital role for all life on earth because it supports plant life by providing nutrients and water as well as supporting roots. The hollow structure of the soil is also a good place for roots to breathe and grow. Soil is also the living habitat of various microorganisms. For most land animals, the land provides a place to live and move around. The science that studies various aspects of soil is known as soil science. In terms of climatology, soil plays an important role as water storage and suppresses erosion, although the soil itself can also erode. Soil composition varies from one location to another. Water and air are part of the land. Soil comes from the weathering of rocks with the help of organisms, forming a unique body that covers the rocks. The process of soil formation is known as ''pedogenesis''. This unique process forms soil as a natural body consisting of layers or is referred to as a soil horizon. Each horizon tells about the origin and physical, chemical and biological processes that have been passed through the soil body. Hans Jenny (1899-1992), a soil expert from Switzerland working in the United States, stated that soil is formed from parent material that has undergone modification/weathering due to the dynamics of climatic factors, organisms (including humans), and the relief of the earth's surface (topography). as time goes by. Based on the dynamics of these five factors, various types of soil are formed and soil classification can be carried out. Soil is formed from rocks and rocks take millions of years to turn into soil. Rocks become soil because of weathering, namely the process of breaking down rocks into soil.",

Weather factors that cause rock weathering, such as temperature and rainfall. Weathering caused by weather factors is called physical weathering. The living things that cause weathering, for example trees and mosses are called biological weathering. Soil is formed from several factors: rocks, climate, living organisms, topography and time. There are various differences in these factors, the processes of weathering and soil formation are different. This causes differences in soil types from one region to another. Decomposers or decomposers are organisms that eat dead organisms and waste products from other organisms. Decomposers help cycle nutrients back into the ecosystem. Decomposers make soil rich by adding organic compounds with it. Substances such as carbon, water and nitrogen are returned to the ecosystem through the action of decomposers. Examples of decomposers include insects, earthworms, bacteria, fungi, maggots, lactobacteria, cockroaches, yeast, slugs, mosses, and actinomycetes/actinobacteria. Decomposers or decomposers are living things that obtain energy by decomposing the remains of living things that have died. The soil component is the composition of the process of soil formation. Soil is not a pile of solid material in a dead and static system, but is a dynamic and living system that changes from time to time. Every soil is composed of mineral/inorganic matter, organic matter, groundwater, and air. Mineral material comes from the weathering of rocks, while organic matter comes from the decomposition of dead organisms. However, the ratio of each of the components making up the soil varies for each soil and changes at any time. For a good ratio of soil components what plants need ideally is 45% mineral matter, 5% organic matter, 25% water and 25% air.",

Since the time of Carl Linnaeus, great apes have been considered the closest relative to humans, based on morphological similarities. In the 19th century, it was thought that the closest relatives to humans were chimpanzees and gorillas, and based on their similarities, it was suggested that humans share a common ancestor with African apes and their fossils must be found in Africa. This branch of science is thought to have emerged at the end of the 19th century when important discoveries were made that led to the study of human evolution. This is the discovery of Neanderthal humans in Germany, Thomas Huxley's work entitled Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature, and Charles Darwin's work entitled The Descent of Man is an important beginning of paleoanthropological research. The modern branch of paleoanthropology began in the 19th century with the discovery of the \"Neanderthal man\" (found in 1856, but similar bones have been found elsewhere since 1830), and with evidence suggesting that it was a caveman. The idea that humans are similar to great apes had been around for some time, but the idea of \u200b\u200bthe biological evolution of species in general was not recognized until after Charles Darwin published On the Origin of Species in 1859.",

It is a steel-gray, shiny, hard and brittle metal that requires high polishing, resists tarnishing, and has a high melting point. The element's name is derived from the Greek \u03c7\u03c1\u1ff6\u03bc\u03b1, chroma, meaning color, because many chromium compounds are very colorful. Ferrochromium alloys are produced commercially from chromite by cilicothermal or aluminothermal reactions and chromium metal by roasting and leaching followed by reduction using carbon and then aluminum. Chromium metal is of high value because of its high resistance to corrosion and hardness. A major development was the discovery that steel could be made highly corrosion and tarnishing resistant by the addition of metallic chromium to form stainless steel. Stainless steel and chrome plating (electroplating with chromium) together account for 85% of commercial use. Trivalent chromium ion (Cr(III)) in trace amounts is an essential nutrient in humans for insulin, sugar and lipid metabolism, although this issue is still being debated. While chromium metal and Cr(III) ions are considered non-toxic, hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) is toxic and carcinogenic. Obsolete chromium production sites often require environmental cleaning. Chromium is amazing for its magnetic properties: it is the only solid element that exhibits a degree of antiferromagnetism at room temperature (and below). Above 38\u00b0C, it becomes paramagnetic. Chromium metal left in the open air is passivated by oxidation, forming a thin protective surface layer. This layer is a spinel structure only a few molecules thick. It is very dense, and prevents the diffusion of oxygen into the underlying metal.",

Passivation can be enhanced by brief contact with an oxidizing acid such as nitric acid. Passivated chromium is stable to acids. Passivation can be removed by strong reducing agents which destroy the protective oxide layer on the metal. Chromium metal that has been given this treatment is easily soluble in weak acids. Chromium, unlike similar metals such as iron and nickel, is not affected by hydrogen embrittlement. However it is affected by nitrogen embrittlement, reacting with nitrogen from water and forming brittle nitrides at high temperatures which are part of metal works. Chromium is the 22nd most abundant element in the Earth's crust with an average concentration of 100 ppm. Chromium compounds are found in the environment from erosion of chromium-containing rocks, and can be disseminated by volcanic eruptions. Typical background chromium concentrations in environmental media are: atmosphere <10 ng\u02d1m\u22123; soil <500 mg\u02d1kg\u22121; vegetation <0.5\u00a0mg\u02d1kg\u22121; fresh water <10 ug\u02d1L\u22121; seawater <1\u00a0ug\u02d1L\u22121; sediment <80\u00a0mg\u02d1kg\u22121.

About two-fifths of the world's chromite ores and concentrates are produced in South Africa, while Kazakhstan, India, Russia and Turkey are also substantial producers. Untapped chromite deposits are abundant, but geographically concentrated in Kazakhstan and southern Africa. Native chromium deposits exist, although they are rare. Udachnaya Pipeline in Russia produces natural metal samples. The mine is a kimberlite pipe, rich in diamonds, and the reducing environment helps to produce both elemental chromium and diamond.

Moggallana was a disciple of the Buddha who possessed the most powerful abilities compared to the other disciples. His abilities include the ability to read minds to tell lies from the truth, get out of his physical body and visit various planes of existence, talk to the spirits and gods. It can also do things like walk through walls, walk on water, fly through the air, and move faster than the speed of light. Various Suttas in the Tipitaka indicate that Moggalla spoke to the souls of the dead to explain to them the terrible state they were in and to give them an understanding of their own misery, so that they could either be liberated or accept it.

This is what the Great Ascetic (Buddha Gotama) teaches.\" This illustrates that Sariputta attained stream-entry from an Arahant, whereas Moggallana attained stream-entry only through an ordinary lay follower, namely his own friend. Maudgalyayana's demise came when he was traveling in Magadha. Some argue that religious worshipers stoned him to death, others say that his death was caused by thieves. It is well known that Moggallana's death was brutal. When asked why Moggallana had not protected himself with his supernatural powers, and why a great Arahant had suffered such a brutal death, the Buddha said that Moggallana had had heavy karmic actions in his previous life (he had killed his own parents and it is one of the gravest misdeeds), he sincerely accepts the fruit of his deed and hastens such a death, so that it occurs as quickly as possible. Further, the Buddha stated that even supernormal powers will be of little or no use to oneself in avoiding their karma, especially when it is so heavy. The Ullambana Sutta is the Sutra of the Mahayana sect to which Moggallana is mentioned. This sutra deals with the topic of being kind to parents, and is a discourse Buddha Shakyamuni gave to Moggallana. In Japan, Ullambana was the basis for the Obon sect, which shares Confucian and Neo-Confucian understandings of ancestor worship.

Women have organs of the female reproductive system, namely the ovaries, uterus and vagina, and are capable of producing gamete cells called eggs. Women also have the ability to menstruate, get pregnant, give birth, and breastfeed. The term \"woman\" is generally used for people of all ages. The general term for female adults is called a woman. Meanwhile, the term for a child who is female is called \"daughter\", \"girl\", or \"girl\". In Indonesia, a more polite greeting or address for respected or older women is \"mother\", or other greetings according to the local language of each region. The opposite sex of women is men. According to popular theory, the word \"female\" comes from the word \"empu\" in Old Javanese, which was later absorbed into Malay, meaning \"lord, noble, respect\". The word master was affixed with the addition of \"per-\" and \"-an\" which then formed the word \"female\". Some sources also state that the word empu in women is related to the word ampu which means \"support, support\".

Cations are positively charged ions, while anions are negatively charged ions. Therefore, a cation molecule has a hydrogen proton without an electron, whereas an anion has an extra electron. Because of their opposite electrical charges, cations and anions are attracted to each other and easily form ionic compounds. Ions containing only one atom are called monatomic ions or atomic ions, while those containing two or more atoms form molecular ions or polyatomic ions. In the case of physical ionization in a medium, such as a gas, \"ion pairs\" are created by collisions of ions, where each pair formed contains a free electron and a positive ion. Ions are also created through chemical interactions, for example dissolving a salt in a liquid, or alternatively, passing a direct current through a conducting solution dissolves the anode via ionization.

This dissertation earned Arrhenius the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1903. Arrhenius' explanation was that in forming a solution, the salt dissociates into Faraday ions. Arrhenius proposed that ions were formed even in the absence of an electric current. Ions in their gaseous state are highly reactive and will quickly interact with ions with opposite charges to produce neutral molecules or ionic salts. Ions are also produced in the liquid or solid state when salts interact with a solvent (eg, water) to produce \"solvated ions\", which are more stable. The ions move away from each other to interact with the liquid for reasons that involve changes in energy and entropy. These stabilized species are more common in low temperature environments. A common example is the ions found in seawater, which come from dissolved salts. All ions have a charge, which means that, like other charged objects, they: Electrons, due to their small mass and large space-occupying properties, are considered matter waves. It determines the entire size of atoms and molecules that have electrons. Anions (negatively charged ions) are larger than the parent molecule or atom, because the excess electrons repel each other thereby increasing the physical size of the ion, and its size is determined by its electron cloud. Thus, in general, cations are smaller than their parent atoms or molecules because the size of their electron cloud is also smaller. The hydrogen cation has no electrons at all, so it only has a single proton - much smaller than the hydrogen atom.",

The train was developed by Alstom and SNCF, and is operated by SNCF, the French National Rail Company. This train connects major cities in France, especially Paris, and also neighboring countries, such as Belgium, Germany, and Switzerland. TGV or TGV-based trains also operate in the Netherlands, South Korea, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States. In France, TGVs have operated on special high-speed lines (LGV, Ligne \u00e0 Grande Vitesse) since 1981. Most TGVs function as passenger trains, but there is also a variety of TGVs used for mail delivery between Paris and Lyon. The TGV network has penetrated into neighboring countries either directly (Italy, Spain, Belgium, Luxembourg and Germany) or through the TGV derivative network connecting France with Switzerland (Lyria), to Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands (Thalys), as well as to the United Kingdom (Eurostar). Cities such as Tours and Le Mans have become part of the \"TGV commuter belt\" around Paris; TGV also serves Charles de Gaulle Airport and Lyon\u2013Saint-Exup\u00e9ry Airport. The TGV users usually stop at Disneyland Paris or in tourist cities such as Avignon and Aix-en-Provence. Brest, Chamb\u00e9ry, Nice, Toulouse and Biarritz can be reached by TGV which uses a mix of LGV fleets and modern lines. In 2007, SNCF made a profit of \u20ac1.1 billion (about US$1.75 billion, \u00a3875 million), largely driven by higher margins on the TGV network. The TGV idea was first proposed in the 1960s. The first prototype, known as the TGV 001, used a gas turbine and produced its own electricity from oil, but after the 1973 energy crisis and the high increase in oil prices, this idea was deemed impractical.",

There are also other lines out of France that are currently under construction to London, Cologne and Amsterdam. Further expansion into Spain and Italy is still being planned. The TGV was not the first high-speed train, as the Japanese Shinkansen connecting Tokyo and Osaka had been open since October 1, 1964, almost 17 years earlier than the TGV. TGV is the record holder for conventional electric trains, where on April 3 2007 the TGV train on the LGV Est line recorded a speed of 574.8\u00a0km/hour in a project test for the V150 variant of the TGV type. This TGV train has a semi-permanent shape with two powered trains at each end, using Jacobs bogies in each train set, making it easier for the train to run smoothly. And at the end of the series, the train has its own bogie. TGV trains can be extended with a series of two other TGVs together, by means of a hidden coupler located at the muzzle (nose) of the TGV train. This design is intended to be advantageous during travel, so that the train can run smoothly on the rails and not deviate from the track. Ordinary trains, on the other hand, can be assembled using couplers and jack-knife, as happened in the train disaster at Eschede. The downside to this train design is that it is difficult to divide train sets. While the TGV electric trains can be removed from the main train by standard uncoupling procedures, special depot equipment is required to split the trains, by lifting the trains all at once.",

In english says contrition Archived 2017-03-27 at the Wayback Machine. or permanently disabled link remorse] often synonymous with repentance Archived 2017-03-27 at the Wayback Machine. which generally translates to repentance in Indonesian. As a central concept in much of Christianity, contrition is seen as the first step, through Christ, toward reconciliation with God. This concept includes one's remorse for all one's sins, a desire for God rather than sin, and faith in Christ's atonement on the cross and its sufficiency for salvation (cf. regeneration and ordo salutis). Regret can be found in various parts of the Bible, for example Ezekiel 33:11, Psalm 6:7 etc., Psalm 51:1-12, Luke 13:5, Luke 18:9-13, and the parable of the prodigal son (Luke 15:11 -32). The Council of Trent defines contrition as \"grief of the soul, and an abhorrence for sins committed, with a firm intention not to sin in the future\". This hatred of sin can arise for various motives, for various reasons. Inner contrition is accompanied by a beneficent anguish and pain, which the Church Fathers called animi cruciatus (sorrow of the spirit) and compunctio cordis (remorse of the heart). The word regret implies the breaking or breaking of something that has hardened. St. Thomas Aquinas in his Commentary on Sententiarum thus explains its specific usage: \"Since it is required for remission of sins, that one completely abandons sinful pleasures which implies a kind of continuity and stability in one's mind, this act for which forgiveness is obtained is figuratively termed 'repentance'\".",

        "paragraph": "This sadness or sorrow of the soul is not just a speculative sadness for the wrong done, remorse of conscience, or a determination to make changes, but is a real pain and trembling of the soul accompanied by a sense of hatred and horror for the sin committed. The feeling of hatred for the sin causes a person to be determined not to sin again. The early Christian writers, when talking about the nature of regret, sometimes emphasized the feeling of sadness, sometimes disgust for the wrong done. St. Augustine included both when he wrote: \"Compunctus corde non solet dici nisi stimulus peccatorum in dolore p\u0153nitendi\". Almost all medieval theologians were of the view that the main regret was based on abhorrence or hatred of sin. Such hatred presupposes that one has a knowledge of the horrors of sin, and this knowledge produces sorrow and pain in the soul. \"A sin is committed by the consent of the will], so it is covered by the argument of the rational will; then regret is basically sadness. But it should be noted that sadness has a double meaning--the argument of the will and the feeling that arises; the first mentioned is the essence of regret, the last mentioned is the impact\". The official teaching or doctrine of the Church, presented in the Council of Trent, states that repentance is always necessary for a person to obtain forgiveness for his sins. Repentance is the first condition and must to obtain forgiveness. It is possible for a person to receive forgiveness when sacramental confession is not possible, but it is impossible for a person to receive forgiveness for his sins without repentance. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, Catholic writers always emphasize that the need or necessity arises: (a) from the nature of repentance itself and (b) from God's positive command. In terms of the nature of the repentance, they emphasize that the words of Christ in Luke 13:5 are absolute: \"... if you do not repent, you will all perish...\", and from the Church Fathers they quote the following sentence from St. . Ciprianus, De Lapsis no.32: \"Practice complete repentance, give evidence of the sorrow that comes from a sorrowful and lamenting soul ... those who put away remorse for sin, close the door to reconciliation.\"",

Parthenogenesis occurs naturally in several species, including lower plants, invertebrates (examples of water fleas, aphids, and some bees), and vertebrates (examples of some reptiles, fish, and, very rarely, birds, and sharks). Parthenogenesis is a form of reproduction asexual namely the ability of an ovum to develop into a new individual without being fertilized by sperm. An example of parthenogenesis is in bees. Ovum that comes from a female bee if it is not fertilized by sperm will become a new individual, namely a male individual. Parthenogenesis is a form of asexual reproduction in which the female produces eggs that develop without going through the process of fertilization. We can see parthenogenesis in aphids, bees, water fleas, and several other invertebrates, as well as in some plants. It turns out that Komodo dragons and sharks are also capable of parthenogenetic reproduction, along with several genera of fish, amphibians and reptiles - which have shown different forms of asexual reproduction, including true parthenogenesis, gynogenesis and hybridogenesis (an imperfect form of parthenogenesis). Alternating between parthenogenesis and sexual reproduction is called heterogamy. Forms of reproduction related to parthenogenesis but requiring sperm are called gynogenesis and hybridogenesis. The form of asexual reproduction associated with parthenogenesis is gynogenesis. Offspring are produced by the same mechanism as in parthenogenesis, but with the provision that the egg must be stimulated in the presence of sperm so that it can develop. However, sperm cells do not contribute any genetic material to the offspring. In reproduction hybridogenesis reproduction is not strictly asexual but rather hemiclonal. Chromosome pairs from the mother are paired with their (similar) copies which can be described as half clones.",

Nickel is a transition metal, and has hard and ductile properties. Nickel also belongs to the iron-cobalt group of metals, which can yield very valuable alloys. Pure nickel is powdered to maximize reactive surface area, has significant chemical activity, but large pieces react slowly with air under normal conditions because an oxidized layer forms on the surface and prevents further corrosion (passivation). However, pure nickel is only found in small quantities in the Earth's crust, usually in ultrabasic rocks, and in iron or siderite meteorites that were not exposed to oxygen while outside the Earth's atmosphere. Nickel in meteorites was found along with iron, which came from supernovae. An iron\u2013nickel mixture is thought to make up the Earth's outer core and inner core. The use of nickel (as a nickel-iron alloy) dates back to 3500 BC. Nickel was first classified as a chemical element in 1751 by Axel Fredrik Cronstedt, who initially mistook the ore for the mineral copper, in the cobalt mines of Los, H\u00e4lsingland, Sweden. The element's name comes from the mischievous fairy from German miners' mythology, Nickel (similar to Old Nick), who personified the fact that copper\u2013nickel ores could not be refined into copper. An economically important source of nickel is the limonite iron ore, which contains 1\u20132% nickel. Other important nickel ore minerals include pentlandite and a naturally occurring nickel-rich mixture of silicates known as garnierite.

Carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins and minerals are nutrients in food that are needed by the body. Liquids to be consumed are often referred to as drinks, but the word 'food' can also be used in its place. Food consumed by humans is called food, while food consumed by animals is called feed. The quality of a food can be judged from the food energy and shelf life it has. Inappropriate or insufficient food consumption will lead to malnutrition, and can have an impact on various health problems. In addition, some types of food can trigger food allergies when consumed by sensitive individuals. Foodstuffs are processed into a variety of different dishes and are characteristic of a culture or population in a particular geographical location. Food is a subject that is studied in various sciences, such as food science, nutrition or nutrition, and gastronomy. Most of the food comes from plants. Some foods are obtained directly from plants. Cereal grains are a staple food that provides more food energy worldwide than any other type of crop. Corn (maize), wheat and rice - in all their varieties - account for 87% of all grain production worldwide. Most of the grain produced worldwide is used as animal feed. Some foods that are not of animal or plant origin include various edible mushrooms, especially mushrooms. Fungi and bacteria are used in the preparation of fermented and pickled foods such as leavened bread, liqueurs, cheeses, pickles, kombucha and yogurt. Another example is blue-green algae such as Spirulina. Inorganic substances such as salt, baking soda and cream of tartar are used to preserve or modify chemicals.",

The island of Madagascar is the fourth largest island in the world and the second largest archipelago in the world after Indonesia. In addition to the main island, several small islands in the vicinity also claim this republic, namely Juan de Nova Island, Europa Island, Glorioso Islands, Tromelin Island, and Bassas da India even though these islands belong to France. Although geographically adjacent to Africa, Madagascar's geological, biological and demographic history differs from that of the continent's mainland. If you visit this country, the atmosphere feels more like in Southeast Asia than Africa seen from the landscape, language, culture, and social conditions of the people. The name \"Malagasy\" is used to refer to the language and the nation. Geologically, Madagascar is on a separate plate from the main continent of Africa. First separated from the Indian subcontinent, the island is moving closer and closer to the continent. This island is an old continent, just like Australia, so the soil is deficient in minerals due to the absence of volcanic activity. Most of the soil is red, indicating a weathered state of the soil. As a result of hundreds of millions of years of isolation, the flora and fauna of Madagascar are very distinctive and many endemic species are found there. This situation is similar to what happened on the island of Sulawesi. The first humans to inhabit Madagascar came from the Archipelago, especially from South Kalimantan (Banjar tribe), and are thought to have been due to the trade relations of the Archipelago people to the east coast of Africa in the early centuries of the Christian era. Based on statistical and linguistic lexico evidence, the Malagasy language is still one of the closest to the Maanyan languages, and belongs to the Austronesian language family.",

Despite their different origins, all residents speak the same language, even though they have different dialects. Reference needed] In the Malagasy language, the island of Madagascar is called Madagascar and the people are called Malagasy. The island's title \"Madagascar\" is not of local origin but was popularized in the Middle Ages by Europeans. With an area of \u200b\u200b592,800 square kilometers (228,900 sq mi), Madagascar is the 46th largest country in the world and the fourth largest island in the world.

The closest land country is Mozambique, located to the west. The breakup of the prehistoric continent of Gondwana separated Madagascar-Antarctica-India from the African-South American continent about 135 million years ago. Madagascar then broke away from India about 88 million years ago, so the island's plants and animals evolved in isolation. The east coast of the island is a narrow, steep slope containing much of the island's remaining tropical lowland forest.",

In popular usage, phenomenon often refers to an extraordinary event. The term is most often used to refer to events that initially contradict explanations or confuse observers. According to the Appearance Discourse Dictionary: In ordinary language, 'phenomena' refers to any incident that is worthy of note and investigation, usually an unexpected or unusual event, a person, or a fact that has special significance or vice versa. In modern philosophical usage, the term phenomenon means 'what is experienced based on reality'. In his inaugural dissertation entitled On Forms and Principles of a Reasonable and Understandable World, Immanuel Kant (1770) theorized that the human mind is limited to a logical world. Thus, the human mind can only interpret and understand events according to its physical appearance. He wrote that humans can infer as much as the senses can perceive, but not experience or feel the object itself. This may make sense in terms of a communication channel (epistemology) derived from an ensemble of reality-inputs (ontology), but not in the sense of exercising sober imagination (a-la Albert Einstein, for partial success). Thus, the term phenomenon refers to every event that deserves to be examined and investigated, especially processes and events that are very unusual or have special significance.",

This compound was the first synthetic organic compound that was successfully prepared from inorganic compounds, which ultimately undermined the concept of vitalism. Urea was first discovered by Hilaire Roulle in 1773. This compound was the first organic compound that was successfully synthesized from inorganic compounds. Urea is formed through an oxidation process that occurs in the liver. Erythrocytes or red blood cells that have been damaged (120 days) are broken down into 'haemo' and 'globin'. Furthermore, the 'haemo' will be converted into bile dyes, namely bilirubin and urobilin which contain urea and ammonia which will be excreted with urine and feces. About 90% of industrial urea is used as chemical fertilizer. Urea in the form of prills is used in agriculture as a chemical fertilizer that supplies nitrogen. In soil, urea will hydrolyze and release ammonium ions. The N content in urea is 46%, but half is used by plants. Because it is important in agricultural development, urea fertilizer is often subsidized by the government of a country, including Indonesia. In the Indonesian market, urea fertilizer is marketed in two forms: subsidized (in pink, used for development assistance) and unsubsidized (in white, to be marketed commercially). Urea fertilizer is produced as a by-product of natural gas processing or coal combustion. The carbon dioxide produced from these industrial activities is then mixed with ammonia through the Bosch-Meiser process.

During this time, the influence of Greek culture and power reached its peak in Europe and Asia. This period is sometimes called the transition period, or even decline, between the brilliant Classical Age and the rise of the Roman Empire. This period began after Alexander's death in 323 BC and ended when the Roman Republic conquered mainland Greece in 146 BC; or when Alexander's last successor state fell, the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt in 31/30 BC, in the Battle of Actium. The Hellenistic period is characterized by a new wave of colonies founded by Greek cities and kingdoms in Asia and Africa. The word Hellenistic comes from the German term hellenistisch, from Ancient Greek \u1f19\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2 ( Hell\u0113nist\u1e17s, Greek speaking person), and \u1f19\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac\u03c2 (Hell\u00e1s, \"Greek\").

Following Droysen, the term Hellenistic and other terms, such as Hellenism, have been widely used in various contexts; a well-known usage is in Culture and Anarchy by Matthew Arnold, where the term Hellenism is used in contrast to Hebraism.

The Greek population did not always mix with the natives; Greeks tend to move around and bring their own culture with them, but interaction doesn't always happen. Although there were early fragments, no complete historical form survived for hundreds of years after Alexander's death. The works of the Hellenistic historian Hieronymus of Cardia (who worked under Alexander, Antigonus I and other successors), Duris of Samos and Philarchus used as surviving sources have been lost. The most credible surviving source for the Hellenistic period is Polybius of Megalopolis, a statesman of the Achaean League until 168 BC when he was forced to go to Rome as a hostage. His historical records number 40 books, covering the years 220 to 167 BC. His other sources include Justin's epitoma from Pompeius Trogus's Historiae Philipicae and a summary of Arrian's activities after Alexander, by Photios I of Constantinople. Fewer additional sources include Curtius Rufus, Pausanias, Pliny, and the Byzantine encyclopedia Suda.

It is a notoriously toxic metalloid material and has three allotropic forms; yellow, black, and gray. Arsenic and arsenic compounds are used as pesticides, herbicides, insecticides and in various alloys. Arsenic has chemical characteristics similar to Phosphorus, and can often be used as a substitute in various biochemical reactions and is also toxic. When heated, arsenic rapidly oxidizes to arsenic oxide, which smells like garlic. Arsenic and some arsenic compounds can also directly sublimate, changing from a solid to a gas without first becoming a liquid. Arsenic is found in two solid forms which are yellow and metallic in color, with specific gravity of 1.97 and 5.73. The word arsenic is borrowed from the Persian \u0632\u0631\u0646\u064a\u062e Zarnik which means \"yellow orpiment\". Zarnik is borrowed in Greek as arsenicone. Arsenic has been known and used in Persia and in many other places since ancient times. It was often used to kill, and the symptoms of arsenic poisoning were difficult to explain, until the invention of the Marsh test, a sensitive chemical test for the presence of arsenic. Because it is often used by rulers to get rid of their opponents and because of its extraordinary killing power and difficulty to detect, arsenic is called the Poison of kings, and King of all poisons. In the Bronze Age, arsenic was often used in bronze, which made the alloy harder. Warangan, which is often used as a coating material for keris surfaces, contains the main ingredient arsenic. Arsen evokes the prestige of the keris by emphasizing the contrast on the prestige. In addition, arsenic also increases the lethality of the stabbing weapon.

Arsenic was also rubbed on women's faces and arms to whiten their skin. However this is highly discouraged now. Some places on earth contain arsenic high enough to seep into groundwater. WHO sets the highest safe threshold for arsenic in groundwater at 50 ppb (parts per billion). Most of the areas with the highest arsenic content are alluvial areas which are river silt deposits and soils rich in organic matter. It is estimated that around 57 million people drink groundwater contaminated with excess arsenic, making it potentially toxic. Arsenic in groundwater is naturally occurring, and is released from sediments into groundwater due to the absence of oxygen in the subsurface layer. This groundwater began to be used after a number of western NGOs researched large well water programs in the late 20th century, but failed to find the presence of arsenic in the groundwater. It is considered to be the worst mass poisoning in history and possibly the worst environmental disaster in history. In Bangladesh there is an epidemic of mass poisoning caused by arsenic.

There is also disagreement about whether space itself is measurable or part of a measurement system.

Marianne (pronounced ma\u0281jan]) has been the national personification of the French Republic since the French Revolution, as a personification of freedom, equality, brotherhood and reason, as well as a depiction of the Goddess of Freedom. Marianne is featured in many places in France and holds honorable places in town halls and law courts. He is depicted in The Triumph of the Republic, a bronze statue facing the Place de la Nation in Paris, and is represented with another Parisian bust on the Place de la R\u00e9publique. His profile features prominently on the country's official government logo, is engraved on French euro coins, and appears on French postage stamps. Previously the image was also displayed in francs.",

Marianne is an important republican symbol; another French monarchical equivalent was often Jeanne d'Arc. As a national icon, Marianne represents the resistance to monarchy and the champion of freedom and democracy against all forms of oppression. Other French national symbols include the tri-colour flag, the national motto Libert\u00e9, \u00c9galit\u00e9, Fraternit\u00e9, the national anthem \"La Marseillaise\", the coat of arms and the official Grand Coat of Arms of France. Marianne also wears a folded cockade of the French coat of arms and a red hat which symbolizes Freedom. Since classical times, it has been common to symbolize abstract ideas and entities by gods, goddesses, and allegorical personifications. During the French Revolution of 1789, many allegorical personifications of 'Freedom' and 'Reason' appeared. The two figures eventually merge into one: a female figure, shown sitting or standing, and accompanied by various attributes, including a French cockade and a red Phrygian hat. This woman usually symbolizes Freedom, Reason, Nation, Homeland and the virtues of the Civil Republic. (Compare New York's Statue of Liberty, created as Freedom that Lights the World by French artist Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Auguste Bartholdi, with copies in Paris and Saint-\u00c9tienne.) In September 1792, the National Convention decreed that the country's new seal would represent a standing woman. holding a spear with a Phrygian hat held high on it. The historian Maurice Agulhon, who in several notable works undertook detailed investigations to discover Marianne's origins, points out that it was French tradition and mentality that led to the use of a woman to represent the Republic. The feminine allegory was also a way of symbolizing a break with the old monarchy led by a king, and promoting a modern republican ideology.",

        "paragraph": "Tax (from the Latin taxo; \"rate\") is a mandatory contribution to the state that is owed by individuals or entities that are coercive under the law, by not getting compensation directly and used for the needs of the state for the greatest prosperity of the people. According to Charles E. McLure, taxes are financial obligations or levies imposed on taxpayers (individuals or entities) by the state or institutions whose functions are equivalent to the state which are used to finance various kinds of public expenditures. Taxes are levied based on legal norms to cover the costs of collective production of goods and services to achieve the general welfare. Refusal to pay, avoidance, or resistance to taxes is generally a violation of the law. Taxes consist of direct taxes or indirect taxes and can be paid in money or in labor of equivalent value. Some countries do not impose taxes at all, for example the United Arab Emirates. The government agency that manages state taxation in Indonesia is the Directorate General of Taxes (DGT), which is a directorate general under the auspices of the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Indonesia. There are different legal and economic definitions of tax from tax. Economists believe that not all financial transfers to the public sector can be categorized as taxes. An example is some transfers to the public sector which are still affected by prices. This is for example, tuition fees at state universities and costs for providing services to the government. Governments also obtain financial resources by \u201ccreating\u201d money (e.g. by printing money), through grants (e.g., contributions to state universities and museums), by imposing sanctions (such as fines for traffic violations), by taking on debt, and by seizing riches. From the point of view of economists, taxes are non-penalty transfers of resources from the private sector to the public sector which are levied on a predetermined basis and without declaring the benefits to be provided.",

        "paragraph": "In the modern taxation system, the government collects taxes in money, but both in-kind and in-kind payments of taxes are characteristic of traditional or pre-capitalist taxes and function equally. The system of taxation and government spending on tax revenue is a topic that is often debated by whom?] in a political and economic context. Tax collection is carried out by public institutions such as the Directorate General of Taxes in Indonesia, the Canada Revenue Agency in Canada, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the United States, or Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) in England. When taxes are not paid, the government can impose legal sanctions such as fines, confiscation of assets, and even detention of those who are proven to have done so. There are various definitions or definitions of \"tax\" put forward by experts, including: Taxes from an economic perspective are understood as the transfer of resources from the private sector to the public sector. This understanding illustrates that the tax causes two situations to change. First, the reduced ability of individuals to control resources for the benefit of controlling goods and services. Second, increasing the state's financial capacity in the provision of public goods and services which are the needs of the community. While the understanding of tax from a legal perspective according to Soemitro is an agreement that arises because of a law that causes the obligation of citizens to deposit a certain amount of income to the state, the state has the power to force and the tax money must be used for government administration. From this legal approach, it shows that the tax collected must be based on the law so as to guarantee legal certainty, both for the tax collector as a tax collector and for the taxpayer as a tax payer. Tax according to Article 1 point 1 of Law no. 6 of 1983, as amended several times, most recently by Law Number 16 of 2009 concerning general provisions and procedures for taxation, is \"compulsory contributions to the state owed by individuals or entities that are coercive based on the law, without receiving reciprocal directly and used for the needs of the state for the greatest prosperity of the people'' The existence of tax collection was first known to have occurred in Ancient Egypt around 3000 \u2013 2800 BC where the known tax system was in the form of a variable tax system, namely based on the height of the Nile river water.",

Along with popular protests, palace coups posed a grave threat to dictators. The 12th century BC Harem Conspiracy is one of the earliest. Palace coups were common in Imperial China. They also occurred among the Habsburg dynasty in Austria, the Al-Thani dynasty in Qatar, and in Haiti in the 19th to early 20th centuries. The majority of Russian tsars between 1725 and 1801 were either overthrown or seized power in palace coups.

The term was originally coined for Z\u00fcriputsch on September 6, 1839 in Switzerland. It was also used for attempted coups in Weimar Germany, such as the 1920 Kapp Putsch, K\u00fcstrin Putsch, and Adolf Hitler's 1923 Beer Hall Putsch.

Germans still use the term R\u00f6hm-Putsch to describe the event, a term given to it by the Nazi regime, despite the unproven implication that the assassination was necessary to prevent a reactionary coup.

In the field of physics or in everyday terms, distance can refer to the length (physically) between two positions, or an estimation based on certain criteria (for example the distance between Jakarta and Bandung). The distance from point A to point B is generally expressed as |AB|{\\displaystyle |AB|}. In most cases, the phrase \"distance from A to B\" is interchangeable with \"distance from B to A\". In mathematics, the distance or metric function is a generalization of the concept of physical distance; namely as a way to give an understanding of how \"far\" or \"close\" the positions of two objects are. In psychology and the social sciences, distance is a non-numeric measure. Physical distance can refer to several different things: An uncommon definition of distance can be useful for modeling certain physical situations, but is also used in pure mathematics: The measure of distance in cosmology is more complicated because it is affected by the expansion factors of the universe, and by the effects described by the theory of relativity (such as a contraction in the length of a moving object). The definition of \"distance\" is also used as an analogy for measuring two non-physical objects in some way. In computer science, there is a notation of \"editing distance\" between two strings. For example, the words \"eat\" and \"tomb\" which differ by only one letter, are closer together than the words \"eat\" and \"night\" which have a difference of two letters. This concept is used in code theory and in spell checkers. Mathematically distance can be defined in several ways: In mathematics, a metric space is a set in which the distance between the members of the set is defined. In this way, many types of \"distance\" can be computed, such as graph traversals, distribution comparisons and curves, and unusual definitions of \"space\" (for example folds and reflections).",

In psychology, human geography, and the social sciences, distance is often understood not as an objective measure, but as a subjective experience. Both distance and displacement measure the movement of an object. Distance is a scalar quantity while displacement is a vector quantity with magnitude and direction. The distance between the two points cannot be negative. On the other hand, directional character does not measure movement; it measures the position of a point from a reference point, and is expressed in vector form. The distance traveled by a vehicle (e.g. as recorded by an odometer), person, animal, or object along a curved path from point A to point B must be distinguished from the straight-line distance from A to B, because in general straight-line distances do not equal the distance traveled, except for traveling in a straight line.

This name is in honor of James Watt, the inventor of the steam engine in the 18th century AD. Power is a scalar quantity. In physics, power is the speed with which work is done. Power is equal to the amount of energy required per unit time. The power integral over time defines the work done. Because the integral depends on the path of force and torque, the work calculation is path dependent. As a basic physics concept, force requires a change in a body and a specific time when the change occurs. This is different from the concept of work, which only measures changes in the state of things. For example, the work done by a person is the same when lifting weights up regardless of running or walking, but it takes more power to run because work is done in less time. The output power of an electric motor is the result of multiplying the torque produced by the motor and the angular speed of the output shaft. Power in a moving vehicle is the product of the traction force of the wheels and the speed of the vehicle. The speed at which a light bulb converts electrical energy into light and heat is measured in watts\u2014the higher the value, the more electrical energy required per unit time. The dimension of power is energy divided by time. The SI unit of power is the watt (W), which is one joule per second. Other units of power are erg per second (erg/s), horsepower (hp), metric horsepower (Pferdest\u00e4rke (PS) or cheval vapeur (CV)), and foot-pounds per minute.

Electrical power can be generated from changing the working power during the electromagnetic induction process taking place in the magnetic coil. The induced voltage on a conducting rod that is in a magnetic field will produce an induced current with a certain value. These induced voltages and currents produce a power in Joules which is equal to the power released into the conductor. This power in Joule units is generated as a result of mechanical work originating from the process of moving the conducting rods. Meanwhile, in the conducting rod there is a force that moves in the opposite direction, so that the mechanical power turns into electrical power. The distribution of electric power through cables always results in power losses. Reduction of power losses is done by reducing the value of the electrical resistance in the cable. Resistance values \u200b\u200bcan be reduced by using electrical materials with low specific resistance, such as copper or aluminum. The type resistance of an electrical material is a constant that cannot be changed, so that the reduction in the value of the electrical resistance can only reach a certain minimum value. Impairment can be done again by engineering electrical materials. The first way to engineer materials so that their electrical resistance is very small is to mix electrical materials so that a resistance that is smaller than the electrical materials found in nature is found. The second way is to use a cable with a larger cross-sectional area. The electrical resistance will be smaller if the cross-sectional area is larger.

        "paragraph": "The Fahrenheit scale is one of the temperature scales besides Celsius and Kelvin. The name Fahrenheit is taken from a German scientist named Gabriel Fahrenheit (1686-1736). This scale was proposed in 1724. In this scale, the freezing point of water is 32 degrees Fahrenheit (written as 32 \u00b0F) and the boiling point of water is 212 degrees Fahrenheit. Negative 40 degrees Fahrenheit is the same as negative 40 degrees Celsius. The Fahrenheit scale is widely used in the United States.) There is some debate as to how Fahrenheit thought of his temperature scale. Some claim that Fahrenheit determines the zero point (0\u00b0F) and 100\u00b0F on his temperature scale by recording the lowest outside temperature he can measure, and his own body temperature. He used the lowest outside temperature as the zero point which he measured in the winter of 1708 before 1709 in his hometown, Gd\u00e1nsk (Danzig) (-17.8\u00b0C). Fahrenheit wanted to avoid negative temperatures as the Ole R\u00f8mer scale often indicates negative temperatures in everyday use. Fahrenheit determined that his own body temperature was 100\u00b0F (a normal body temperature is close to 98.6\u00b0F, meaning that either Fahrenheit had a fever when experimenting or the thermometer was inaccurate). He divided his normal scale into 12 divisions, and then the 12 divisions were each subdivided into 8 sub-divisions. This division results in a 96 degree scale. Fahrenheit said that on his scale, the freezing point of water is at 32\u00b0F, and the boiling point of water is at 212\u00b0F, a difference of 180 degrees. There are also those who say that Fahrenheit determines the zero point (0\u00b0F) on his scale as the temperature at which the mixture is evenly distributed. between ice and melted salt and 96 degrees being the temperature of his blood (he originally used horse blood to indicate the scale).",

He later found that water (without anything mixed in) would freeze at 32 degrees and boil at 212 degrees. The third is the most familiar story, as depicted on the popular physics television series The Mechanical Universe. The series states that Fahrenheit adopted R\u00f8mer's scale in which water freezes at 7.5 degrees and multiplied each value by 4 to eliminate fractions and increase the granularity of the scale (giving 30 and 240 degrees). Then he again scaled it between the freezing point of water and normal human body temperature (where he took 96 degrees); the freezing point of water is determined to be 32 degrees so there are 64 intervals it would halve. So he could mark the degree line on his tool by halving the interval twice. Not all measurements are accurate. Using the original scale, the actual freezing and boiling points of water would differ by 32\u00b0F and 212\u00b0F. Some time after his death, it was decided to re-sign the scale with 32\u00b0F and 212\u00b0F being the correct freezing and boiling points of pure water. This change makes it easy to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa using a simple formula. This change also explains why body temperature was once determined to be 96 or 100\u00b0F by Fahrenheit and is now defined as 98.6\u00b0F by many, although a value of 98\u00b0F would be more accurate.

Weir (weir) is a low-head dam structure (lowhead dam), which serves to raise the water level, usually found in rivers. River water whose level is raised will overflow through the crest/crest of the weir (overflow).

In countries with relatively large and fast-flowing rivers, a series of weirs can be operated to form a water transportation system.

It is thought that the primordial nucleons themselves formed from the quark-gluon plasma from the Big Bang when it cooled below two trillion Kelvin. Minutes later, starting with just protons and neutrons, nuclei from aton down to lithium and beryllium (both mass number 7) formed, but only in relatively small numbers. Then the fusion process essentially stops as the temperature and density decrease, as the universe continues to expand. This first primordial nucleosynthesis process can also be referred to as nucleogenesis. Subsequent nucleosynthesis of the heavier elements required the explosion of heavy stars and supernovae. This happened theoretically because hydrogen and helium from the Big Bang (perhaps influenced by the concentration of dark matter), condensed into prime stars 500 million years after the Big Bang. The elements formed in stellar nucleosynthesis range in atomic numbers from 6 (carbon) to at least 98 (californium), which have been detected from the spectra of some supernovae. The synthesis of these heavier elements occurs as a result of either nuclear fission (including multiple slow and fast neutron capture) or nuclear fission, sometimes followed by beta decay. In contrast, many stellar processes actually tend toward the breakdown of deuterium and the isotopes of beryllium, lithium, and boron that were present in stars, after their primordial formation at the time of the Big Bang. The quantities of these lighter elements present in the present-day universe were then thought to have formed primarily through billions of years of cosmic rays (mainly high-energy protons) that mediated the breakup of the heavier elements present in interstellar dust and gas.

At the same time, it is clear that carbon is the next most abundant element, and there is also a general trend towards abundance of the light elements, especially those consisting of all the atomic number helium-4 nuclei. Arthur Stanley Eddington was the first to suggest in the 1920s that stars obtain energy by fusing hydrogen to form helium, but this idea was not generally accepted because of the flawed nuclear mechanism. Immediately a few years later, just before World War II, Hans Bethe was the first to provide the necessary nuclear mechanism, in which hydrogen fused to form helium. However, these two early works on star power were unable to explain the origin of elements heavier than helium. Fred Hoyle's original work on the nucleosynthesis of heavier elements in stars appeared after World War II. This work involved the creation of all the heavy elements in stars during the process of nuclear evolution of their composition, starting from hydrogen. Hoyle proposed that hydrogen was created continuously in the universe from vacuum and energy, without the need for a starting universe. Hoyle's work explains how the abundance of elements increases as galaxies age. In turn, Hoyle's picture was expanded in the 1960s by the creative contributions of William A. Fowler, Alastair G. W. Cameron, and Donald D. Clayton, and later by others. The creative 1957 review paper by Margaret Burbidge, Geoffrey Burbidge, Fowler, and Hoyle (see list of References) is a famous overview of the state of this branch of science in 1957.",

        "paragraph": "Dielectric is a kind of electrical insulating material that can be given polarization by placing the dielectric material in an electric field. When this material is in an electric field, the electric charge contained in it will not flow, so that an electric current does not arise like a conductor material, but only shifts slightly from its equilibrium position resulting in the creation of a dielectric polarity. Because of the dielectric polarity, positive charges move towards the negative pole of the electric field, while negative charges move in the opposite direction (ie towards the positive pole of the electric field). This creates an internal electric field (inside the dielectric material) which causes the total amount of electric field surrounding the dielectric material to decrease. If the dielectric is composed of weakly bonded molecules, these molecules can not only become polarized, but can also rearrange so that their axes of symmetry follow the direction of the electric field. Although the term \"insulator\" also implies low electrical conductivity, the term \"dielectric\" is usually used for insulating materials that have a high degree of polarity, the magnitude of which is represented by the dielectric constant. A common example of a dielectric is the insulator between the conducting plates found in a capacitor. The polarization of a dielectric material by exposing an electric field to it changes the electric charge on the capacitor poles. Research on the properties of dielectric materials is closely related to their ability to store and release electrical and magnetic energy. Dielectric properties are very important for explaining various phenomena in electronics, optics, and solid-state physics. The term \"dielectric\" was first used by William Whewell (from the Greek \"he\" meaning \"pass\" and \"electric\") in response to a request by Michael Faraday. The Xe electrical susceptibility to a dielectric material is a measure of how easily this material is polarized in an electric field, which ultimately determines the electrical permittivity thereby affecting other properties of the dielectric material, for example the capacitance value when used in a capacitor.",

Its chemical formula is commonly written as FeO(OH)\u00b7nH2O, although this is not entirely accurate as the ratio of its oxide to hydroxide can vary considerably. Limonite is one of the two main ores of iron (the other being hematite), and limonite has been mined for iron production since at least 2500 BC. The name Limonit comes from the Greek word for 'meadow' (\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bc\u03ce\u03bd), which refers to the bog iron ore found in meadows and marshes. In its brown color it is sometimes called brown hematite or brown iron ore, while in its bright yellow form it is sometimes called lemon rock or yellow iron ore. Limonite is relatively dense, with a specific gravity ranging from 2.7 to 4.3. Variations in color range from bright lemon yellow to opaque grayish brown. The limonite streaks on unglazed porcelain plates are always brownish in color, a characteristic that distinguishes them from hematite, which gives rise to red streaks, or from magnetite, which gives black streaks. Hardness levels vary, but are generally in the 4-5.5 range. Although originally classified as a single mineral, limonite is now classified as a mixture of related hydrated iron oxide minerals, including goethite, akaganeite, lepidochrosite, and jarosite. The minerals in limonite may form crystals, but limonite itself does not, although specimens show a fibrous or microcrystalline structure, and limonite often occurs as concretions or solid, earthy lumps; sometimes mammary, clustered (bitrioidal), kidney (reniform), or stalactites. Because it is amorphous and occurs in hydrated areas, limonite often occurs as clay or loamy rock.",

Pseudomorphic limonite can also form from other iron oxides, namely hematite and magnetite; or from carbonate siderites and from iron-rich silicates such as almandine garnets. Limonite is usually formed from the hydration of hematite and magnetite, from the oxidation and hydration of iron-rich sulfide minerals, and from the chemical weathering of other iron-rich minerals, such as olivine, pyroxene, amphibole, and biotite. Limonite is often the largest iron component in lateritic soils. It is also frequently deposited in runoff pathways from mining operations. One of limonite's early uses was as a pigment. Yellow limonite gives the ochre yellow color that Cyprus is famous for; while the darker limonite produces earth tones. Roasting converts the limonite to some of it into hematite, which gives red ocher, burnt source and sienna colors. Swamp iron ore and limonite claystone can be mined as a source of iron, although commercial mining of these has ceased in the United States. Gosan from siliceous iron oxides is usually formed as a result of intensive oxidation of sulfide ore deposits. Gosan is used by mine prospectors as a guide to find ore. In addition, if the oxidation of the sulfide deposit contains gold, this is usually an indication of the presence of gold concentrations in the iron oxide and quartz from gosan. Gold bearing limonite gosan is productively mined in the Shasta County district of California. Similar deposits have been mined near Rio Tinto in Spain and Mount Morgan in Australia.",

Formaldehyde was originally synthesized by the Russian chemist Aleksandr Butlerov in 1859, but was identified by Hoffman in 1867. In general, formaldehyde is formed by the catalytic oxidation reaction of methanol. Therefore, formaldehyde can be produced from burning carbon-containing materials and is contained in smoke from forest fires, car exhausts, and tobacco smoke. In the Earth's atmosphere, formaldehyde is produced from the action of sunlight and oxygen on methane and other hydrocarbons present in the atmosphere. Formaldehyde in very small levels is also produced as a metabolite of most organisms, including humans. Although in free air formaldehyde exists in gaseous form, but it is soluble in water (usually sold in a 37% solution level using the trademark 'formalin' or 'formol'). In water, formaldehyde polymerizes and very little is present in the monomer form H2CO. Generally, these solutions contain a few percent methanol to limit their polymerization. Formalin is a solution of formaldehyde in water, with levels between 10% -40%. Although formaldehyde displays the chemical properties of most aldehydes, it is more reactive than other aldehydes. Formaldehyde is an electrophile, can be used in electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions and aromatic compounds and can undergo electrophilic and alkene addition reactions. In the presence of an alkaline catalyst, formaldehyde can undergo the Cannizzaro reaction, producing formic acid and methanol. Formaldehyde can form cyclic trimers, 1,3,5-trioxane or polyoxymethylene linear polymers. The formation of this substance makes the properties of formaldehyde gas different from those of an ideal gas, especially at high pressure or cold air. Formaldehyde can be oxidized by atmospheric oxygen to form formic acid, therefore the formaldehyde solution must be covered and isolated so that air does not enter it.",

The catalyst using silver is usually run at a higher temperature, about 650 \u00b0C. in this situation, there will be two chemical reactions simultaneously that produce formaldehyde: one as above, while the other is a dehydrogenation reaction. When this formaldehyde is oxidized again, it produces formic acid, which is often present in formaldehyde solutions in ppm levels. On a smaller scale, formalin can also be produced from ethanol conversion, which is commercially unprofitable. Formaldehyde can be used to eradicate most bacteria, so it is often used as a disinfectant and also as a preservative. As a disinfectant, Formaldehyde is also known as formalin and is used as a cleaner; floors, ships, warehouses and clothes. Formaldehyde is also used as a preservative in vaccinations. In the medical field, formaldehyde solutions are used to dry the skin, for example removing warts. Solutions of formaldehyde are often used in embalming to kill bacteria and temporarily preserve carcasses. In industry, formaldehyde is mostly used in the production of polymers and various chemicals. When combined with phenol, urea, or melamine, formaldehyde produces a hard thermosetting resin. This resin is used for permanent glues, for example those used for plywood/plywood or carpets. Also in the form of its foam as insulation. More than 50% of formaldehyde production is spent on formaldehyde resin production.

He probably reigned from about 2800\u20132500 BC and was deified after his death. He became the main character in Sumerian legend during the Third Dynasty of Ur (c. 2112 \u2013 2004 BC). The legend of Gilgamesh is told in five Sumerian poems that have survived to this day. Of these five poems, the oldest are probably Gilgamesh, Enkidu, and the Underworld. This poem tells the story of Gilgamesh who helps the goddess Inanna to drive away the creatures that guard the goddess' huluppu tree. In honor of Gilgamesh, the goddess gave him two objects called a mikku and a pikku, but Gilgamesh later lost them. After the death of Enkidu (who is described as Gilgamesh's servant in Sumerian poetry), his spirit tells Gilgamesh about conditions in the Underworld. Meanwhile, the poem Gilgamesh and Agga tells of Gilgamesh rebelling against King Agga. Other Sumerian poems tell of Gilgamesh defeating the giant Huwawa and the Bull of Heaven, while most of the fifth poem is lost, although it seems to be about Gilgamesh's death and burial. In Babylonian times, these poems began to form a connected narrative. The Epic of Gilgamesh was recorded by a scribe named S\u00een-l\u0113qi-unninni, probably in the Middle Babylonian Period (c. 1600 \u2013 1155 BC) and is based on more ancient sources.

Gilgamesh fails the test given to him by Utnapishtim and he returns to Uruk. Most historians agree that the Epic of Gilgamesh influences the Iliad and Odyssey, two epics written in Ancient Greek in the eighth century BCE. The story of Gilgamesh's birth is described in an anecdote from De Natura Animalium by the Greek writer Claudius Aelianus in the second century C.E. Aelianus relates that Gilgamesh's grandfather kept his daughter from becoming pregnant, because he received a prophecy from a seer that his grandson would beget her. The girl became pregnant and the guards threw her child from a tower, but an eagle saved her and brought her to an orchard. He was then raised by a gardener. The Gilgamesh Epic itself was rediscovered in the Ashurbanipal Library in 1849. After the contents of the epic were completed in the early 1870s, it sparked debate over its partial similarities to the Hebrew Bible. Gilgamesh remained a relatively unknown figure until the mid-20th century, but it was after that that he began to be depicted in modern culture.

In general, liquids form crystals when they undergo a solidification process. Under ideal conditions, the result could be a single crystal, in which all the atoms in the solid are \"attached\" to the same lattice or crystal structure. While, in general, most crystals form simultaneously resulting in a polycrystalline solid. Which crystal structure will form from a liquid depends on the chemical structure of the liquid itself, the conditions under which solidification occurred, and the ambient pressure. The process of forming a crystalline structure is known as crystallization. Although the cooling process often produces crystalline materials, under certain circumstances the liquid may freeze in a non-crystalline form. In many cases, this is due to cooling too fast for the atoms to reach their lattice locations. A non-crystalline material is usually called an amorphous or glassy material. Sometimes such materials are also referred to as amorphous solids, although there is a distinct difference between solids and glasses. The process of forming glass does not release specific heat of melting (English: latent heat of fusion). For this reason, many scientists consider glass materials to be liquids, not solids. This topic is controversial, please see glass for further discussion. Crystal structures occur in all classes of materials, with all types of chemical bonds. Almost all metallic bonds exist in the polycrystalline state; amorphous metals or single crystals have to be produced synthetically, with great difficulty. Ionic-bonded crystals can form when salts solidify, either from melting liquids or condensing solutions. Covalent bond crystals are also very common. Examples are diamond, silica, and graphite.

Although the term \"crystal\" has a defined meaning in materials science and solids physics, in everyday life, the term \"crystal\" refers to solid objects that exhibit a certain geometric shape, and are often pleasing to the eye. Various forms of these crystals can be found in nature. The forms of crystals depend on the type of molecular bonds between atoms (to determine their structure) and the circumstances in which the crystals were created. Snowflakes, diamonds, and table salt are all examples of crystals. Some crystalline materials may exhibit special electrical properties, such as the ferroelectric effect or the piezoelectric effect. The behavior of light in a crystal is described in crystal optics. Within the periodic dielectric structure, a series of unique optical properties can be found that are described in photonic crystals.

Humans have used polymers in the form of oils, bitumen, resins, and chewing gum for centuries. But the modern polymer industry just started to develop during the industrial revolution. In the late 1830s, Charles Goodyear succeeded in producing a useful form of natural rubber through a process known as \"vulcanization\". 40 years later, celluloid (a hard plastic form of nitrocellulose) was commercialized. It was the introduction of vinyl, neoprene, polystyrene, and nylon in the 1930s that started an 'explosion' in polymer research that is still ongoing today.

This synonym relates to synthetic polymers which are produced from simple molecules called monomers. The first use of the word polymer was made in 1833 by the Swedish chemist Berzelius.

There is evidence that humans occupied Thailand 40,000 years ago with stone artifacts dating from the Tham Lod Rock Dam in Mae Hong Son. Similar to the rest of Southeast Asia, Thailand is heavily influenced by Indian culture and religion, originating from the Funan Kingdom around the first century AD with the Khmer Empire. Thailand in its early days was subject to the powerful Khmer Empire's Hindu roots, so its influence in Thailand remains to this day.

Gold does not react with other chemicals but is attacked by chlorine, fluorine and aqua regia. This metal is abundant in gold nuggets or dust in rocks and in alluvial deposits and is one of the coinage metals. The ISO code is XAU. Gold melts in liquid form at about 1000\u00b0C. Gold is a metal that is soft and malleable, its hardness ranges from 2.5 \u2013 3 (Mohs scale), and its specific gravity depends on the type and content of other metals that are alloyed with it. Gold-bearing minerals are usually associated with associated minerals (gangue minerals). These associated minerals are generally quartz, carbonate, tourmaline, flourpar, and a small amount of non-metallic minerals. Gold-bearing minerals are also associated with oxidized sulfide deposits. Gold carrier minerals consist of nativ gold, electrum, telluride gold, a number of gold alloys and compounds with the elements sulfur, antimony, and selenium. Electrum is actually another type of nativ gold, only the silver content in it is >20%. Gold formed by magmatism or concentrating on the surface. Some precipitates are formed due to contact metasomatism and hydrothermal solutions, while mechanical concentration produces placer deposits.

The actual size at which a Boat is called a Ship is always fixed by local laws and regulations or custom. For centuries, ships have been used by humans to cross rivers or seas, which was preceded by the invention of boats. Usually, in the past, human beings used canoes, rafts or boats. When the greater the need for power, the bigger the boat or the raft that was called the ship, was made. The materials used for shipbuilding in the past used wood, bamboo or papyrus stems as used by the ancient Egyptians and then used metal materials such as iron/steel because of the human need for strong ships. For propulsion, humans initially used oars and then wind with the help of sails, steam engines after the industrial revolution appeared and diesel and nuclear engines. Several studies gave rise to motorized ships that run floating on water such as Hovercraft and Ekranoplane. As well as ships used on the ocean floor, namely submarines.

About 5,000 years ago, people living near Kongens Lyngby in Denmark invented separate hulls, which allowed boats to be gradually increased in size. The boats soon developed into keel boats similar to today's woodcraft ships. To determine direction, in the past ships sailed not far from continents or land. However, in accordance with developments, the ship's crew finally used the stars as a navigational aid with aids in the form of a compass and astrolabe as well as a map.

In recent years, broadcast television has become accessible via the Internet, for example via iPlayer and Hulu. Although there are other forms of television such as closed circuit television, the type of television most often used is broadcast television, which is based on a radio broadcasting system developed around the 1920s, using high-power radio frequency transmitters to transmit television waves to television wave receivers.

Although mechanical systems were eventually phased out of use, the knowledge gained from the development of electromechanical systems was of great importance in the development of fully electronic television systems.

This thing is judged by its usefulness for human action for life. The statement can be in the form of speech, proposition or theory. Pragmatism emerges as a tradition of thought originating in the West and developing especially in America. Its presence as a thought that seeks to answer the problems of human life. Pragmatism is classified as one of the 19th century philosophical schools in the history of Western philosophy. The pioneer of pragmatism thought was a philosopher from the United States named Chales Sanders Peirce (1839\u20131914). Influential figures in pragmatist thinking include William James (1842\u20131910) and John Dewey (1859\u20131952). The idea of \u200b\u200bpragmatism was first put forward by Charles Sanders Peirce in the early 1870s at a meeting of a philosophical group called the Metaphysical Club. The meeting was held in Cambridge, Massachusetts informally. The discussion results from the meeting were written by Peirce into two articles entitled The Fixation of Belief (1877) and How to Make Our Ideas Clear (1878). Both of these articles were published in a magazine called Popular Science Monthly. The term \"pragmatism\" comes from the Greek, namely from the word pragma. This word has many meanings, including facts, objects, material, something that is made, activities, actions, results or work. From this collection of meanings, pragmatism is defined as a thought that prioritizes the function of ideas in action. On the other hand, the term \"pragmatism\" was obtained by Charles Sanders Peirce from the philosophical thoughts of Immanuel Kant. In Kant's thought there are two similar words with different meanings, namelypracticch and pragmatisch. These two words come from the Greek, namelypracticos and pragmatikos.",

Meanwhile, the term pragmatisch is defined as a movement produced by the human will to provide a definitive goal as an important stage for explaining thoughts correctly. Pragmatism becomes the logic of observation as its rationale. This view states that the reality of the world seen by humans is facts that are real, separate from one another and individual. The world is shown as is, so differences can be taken for granted. The manifestation of reality is always personal and not a public fact because it only arises from the human mind. The function of service and usability becomes a means of justifying an idea. Pragmatism does not discuss the philosophical study of truth, especially with regard to metaphysics. Pragmatism is a philosophical school that assesses the truth of a theory or belief based on its level of success or benefit in practical application. The main problem for pragmatism is about the usefulness of knowledge, not the nature of knowledge. This view is based on the idea that knowledge is a means of action. Pragmatism solves theoretical and practical problems in human life by relying on the use of reason. John Dewey is one of the most influential figures in pragmatist thought. The pragmatic thinking developed by Dewey is also known as experimentalism. This naming comes from his thinking which states that human growth is the goal of education. He calls it growth because he thinks that everything in this world is always changing. John Dewey's pragmatic thinking became one of the thoughts that influenced the start of mass education.

The following is an explanation of the elements that make up a system: 1. Goals Each system has a goal, either just one or maybe many. This goal is the motivator that directs the system.

In the chemical plant, the process can be a raw material. At the hospital, the surgery can be activity of the patient. 4. Output Output is the result of processing. In an information system, output can be in the form of information, suggestions, printed reports, and so on. 5. Boundary The so-called system boundary is the separator between the system and the area outside the system (environment). System limits determine the configuration, scope, or capabilities of the system. For example, a soccer team has game rules and limited player abilities. The growth of a grocery store is influenced by customer purchases, competitor movements and limited funding from banks. Of course the boundary of a system can be reduced or modified so that it will change the behavior of the system. For example, by selling shares to the public, a company can reduce its limited funds. 6. Control and Feedback Mechanisms The control mechanism is realized by using feedback, which captures the output. This feedback is used to control both input and process. The goal is to arrange for the system to run according to its purpose. 7. Environment Environment is everything that is outside the system. The environment can affect the operation of the system in the sense that it can harm or benefit the system itself. An unfavorable environment of course must be restrained and controlled so as not to disrupt the continuity of the system's operation, while a profitable environment must still be maintained, because it will spur the survival of the system.",

If one looks at the general characteristics of the other elements in the same column on the periodic table, it is assumed that francium is a very reactive metal. Obtaining a sample was nearly impossible, because the extreme heat of decay (the half-life of the longest isotope is just 22 minutes) would quickly vaporize any visible amount of element. Francium was discovered by Marguerite Perey in France (hence the element's name) in 1939. It was the last element first discovered in nature, not synthesized. a] Outside the laboratory, francium is extremely rare, with trace amounts found in ores uranium and thorium, where the isotope francium-223 continues to form and decay.

Francium is an alkali metal whose chemical properties largely resemble that of cesium. A heavy element with one valence electron, it has the highest equivalent weight of all the elements. Liquid francium\u2014if prepared\u2014should have a surface tension of 0.05092 N/m at its boiling point. The melting point of francium is calculated to be around 27\u00b0C (80\u00b0F, 300 K). The melting point is uncertain due to the rarity of this element and its radioactivity. Thus, the estimated boiling point value of 677\u00b0C (1250\u00b0F, 950 K) is also uncertain. Linus Pauling estimated the electronegativity of francium to be 0.7 on the Pauling scale, the same as that of cesium; the value for cesium has been refined to 0.79, but there are no experimental data to allow for an improvement in the value for francium. Francium has a slightly higher ionization energy than cesium, 392.811(4) kJ/mol (cesium 375.7041(2) kJ/mol). Francium also has a higher electron affinity than cesium and the Fr\u2212 ion should be more polarized than the Cs\u2212 ion. There are 34 known isotopes of francium ranging from atomic masses 199 to 232. Francium has seven metastable nuclear isomers. Francium-223 and francium-221 are the only isotopes that occur in nature. Francium-223 is the most stable isotope with a half-life of 21.8 minutes, and until recently it was thought that it would not be possible to find a francium isotope with a longer half-life. Francium-223 is the fifth product in the actinium decay series as the daughter isotope of actinium-227. Francium-223 then decays to radium-223 by beta decay (decay energy 1149 keV), and minor (0.006%) by alpha decay to astatine-219 (decay energy 5.4 MeV).",

By 2020, it is estimated that 1.9 billion people around the world will follow Islam, making it the second largest religion after Christianity. Muslims believe that Islam is the complete and universal version of the primordial faith that was handed down many times through previous prophets such as Adam, Abraham, Musa, and Isa (Jesus), among others; This earlier revelation was associated with Judaism and Christianity, which are considered in Islam as spiritual predecessor religions. They also consider the Quran, when preserved in Classical Arabic, as God's unchanging and final revelation to mankind. Like other Abrahamic religions, Islam also teaches about the \"Final Judgment\" where the righteous will be rewarded in heaven (Jannah) and the unrighteous will be punished in hell (Jahannam). Religious concepts and practices include the Pillars of Islam \u2014considered as obligatory worship \u2014 and following Islamic law (shari'a), which touch on almost every aspect of life, from banking and finance and welfare to the role of women and the environment. The cities of Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem are home to the three holiest sites in Islam, in descending order: the Grand Mosque, the Prophet's Mosque and Al-Aqsa Mosque, respectively. \"Islam\" in Arabic is the quadri-literal infinitive noun form (ma\u1e63dar rub\u0101\u2018\u012b).

The concept of \"surrender\" in Islam to God is not a term for fatalism, but rather as the opposite of reluctance in following religious teachings and preferring to choose an easy path in life. A Muslim follows God's commands without opposing or questioning them, but with an effort to understand his wisdom. The term \"Islam\" can also be interpreted as a religion given by God to the Prophet Muhammad as a way of salvation in this world and the hereafter whose teachings are based on monotheism and are applied in all aspects of human life. Islam is actually also used to refer to the monotheistic beliefs shared by the heavenly religions (currently Judaism and Christianity); see QS al-Maidah verse 44, QS Ali Imran verse 67 and 52. However, Islam is more popularly used for the religion brought by Muhammad as found in a verse of the Qur'an that was revealed at the end of his prophethood: Islam is a religion Allah revealed for all mankind. In it there are guidelines and rules for happiness in this world and the hereafter. There are three things that are the main links in the religion of Islam itself, namely Faith, Islam, and Ihsan. In a hadith, it is mentioned: \"From Umar bin al-Khattab RA, said: \"One day we gathered with the Messenger of Allah \ufdfa, suddenly there came a man whose clothes were very white, his hair was very black.

Pollution of the environment can occur anywhere at a very fast rate, and the burden of pollution is getting heavier due to industrial waste from various chemicals including heavy metals. Environmental pollution occurs when the cycle of matter in the environment changes so that the balance in terms of structure and function is disrupted. Imbalance in the structure and function of the material cycle occurs due to natural processes or also due to human actions. Development in the era of globalization is supported by the emergence of very sophisticated technology that can have a very large impact on environmental changes caused by environmental pollution by garbage and waste from development and technology. Residual waste or industrial waste can be in the form of gas or dust, liquids and solids. The remaining liquid waste released by industrial processes is often called industrial waste water. Industrial wastewater varies in amount and intensity of pollution, according to the unit of operation or process that is the source. This liquid waste can cause environmental pollution, namely if this waste or material cannot be destroyed by living organisms and accumulates in environmental components, it will cause health problems.

The condition of the river which is polluted due to waste and garbage can cause a lot of garbage to accumulate on the banks of the river and the water is cloudy and smells fishy. Waste and garbage have great potential in environmental pollution because it causes a decrease in the quality of the environment and damages its natural ecosystem. The negative impact of decreasing environmental quality, whether due to pollution or damage to natural resources, is the emergence of threats or negative impacts on health, decreased aesthetic value, economic losses and disruption of natural systems. The negative impact on public health will be felt in the long term. With the contamination of the environment by waste and garbage, the aesthetic value of the environment will decrease, the polluted environment will look dirty and cannot be used for daily purposes. Pollution of the environment will also disrupt the natural systems of the environment, the components contained in the environment will be damaged.

Enzymes function as biocatalysts of a chemical reaction. The energy required by enzymes in chemical reactions is very small so that it functions to lower the activation energy. The initial molecule called the substrate will be accelerated to change into another molecule called the product. All biological processes of the cell require enzymes in order to proceed quickly enough in a certain direction of metabolic pathway. Enzymes work by reacting with substrate molecules to produce intermediate compounds through an organic chemical reaction that requires a lower activation energy, so that the acceleration of chemical reactions occurs because chemical reactions with higher activation energies take longer. For example: Although the catalyst compound may change in the initial reaction, in the final reaction the catalyst molecule will return to its original shape. Most enzymes work uniquely, which means that each type of enzyme can only work on one type of chemical compound or reaction. This is due to differences in the chemical structure of each enzyme which is fixed. For example, the \u03b1-amylase enzyme can only be used in the process of breaking down starch into glucose. Enzyme work is influenced by several factors, especially the substrate, temperature, acidity, cofactors and inhibitors. Each enzyme requires a different optimum temperature and pH (acidity level) because enzymes are proteins, which can change shape if the temperature and acidity change. Outside the appropriate temperature or pH, enzymes cannot work optimally or their structure will be damaged. This will cause the enzyme to lose its function completely. Enzyme work is also influenced by other molecules. Inhibitors are molecules that decrease enzyme activity, while activators are those that increase enzyme activity.",

However, the mechanisms by which these processes occur have not been identified. French chemist Anselme Payen was the first scientist to discover an enzyme, namely diastase, in 1833. Decades later, Louis Pasteur, who was researching the fermentation of sugar into alcohol using yeast, wrote that this fermentation reaction was caused by a \"vital force\" contained in yeast cells, referred to as \"ferment\", according to which it only functions in the body of living organisms. He wrote that \"alcoholic fermentation is an action related to the life and order of the yeast cells, and not to their death or decay.\" In 1878, the German physiologist Wilhelm K\u00fchne (1837\u20131900) first used the term \"enzyme\", which comes from the Greek \u03b5\u03bd\u03b6\u03c5\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd meaning \"in leavening agent\" or \"in yeast\", to describe this process. The word \"enzyme\" (enzyme) was later used to refer to inanimate substances such as pepsin, and the word ferment was used to refer to chemical activities produced by living organisms. In 1897, Eduard Buchner began his series of scientific papers on yeast extract. In experiments at the University of Berlin, he found that the fermentation of sugar by yeast extract continued even if there were no surviving yeast cells in the mixture. He named the enzyme that triggers this fermentation of sucrose \"zymase\" (zimase). In 1907, he received the Nobel Prize in chemistry for \"discovering cellless fermentation\". The nomenclature of enzymes up to now has followed Buchner's example, namely with the ending -ase and according to the reaction catalyzed by the enzyme.",

All types of organisms are capable of reproduction, growth and development, self-maintenance, and some forms of response to stimuli. Humans, squid, fungi, and vascular plants are all examples of multicellular organisms that differentiate to form specialized tissues and organs during development.

A superorganism is an organism consisting of many individuals working together as a single functional or social unit. Controversy exists about the best way to define organisms and about whether or not such a definition is necessary.

Although some organisms are also unable to survive on their own and must live as intracellular parasites, they are capable of metabolizing and reproducing independently. Although viruses possess some of the enzymes and molecules characteristic of living organisms, they do not have their own metabolism; viruses are unable to synthesize and organize the organic compounds that compose them. Naturally, these cannot be called autonomous reproduction: they can only be passively replicated by the host cell. In this respect, they are similar to inanimate objects.

Astrophysics deals with objects in outer space as well as Earth. Sometimes, the name may change with astronomy because the scope of study is similar to modern times. Astronomy is an ancient science, long separated from the study of terrestrial physics. In Aristotle's worldview, the objects in the sky looked like unchanging spheres and their only motion was uniform motion in a circle. Meanwhile, the terrestrial world is a realm undergoing growth and decay, and its motion is in a straight line that ends when the object reaches its destination. It has been suggested that outer space is made of a different type of matter than that found in the terrestrial world; believed by Aristotle to be the Aether, or as Fire by Plato. During the 17th century, natural philosophers such as Galileo, Descartes, and Newton began to argue that the celestial and terrestrial regions were made of similar types of matter and were subject to the same laws of nature. Their challenge was that at that time no tools had been found to prove this statement. During the nineteenth century, astronomical research focused on the routine measurements and calculations of the positions and motions of astronomical objects. A new branch of astronomy, later to be called astrophysics, only emerged when William Hyde Wollaston and Joseph von Fraunhofer independently discovered that many dark lines (areas where there is little or no light) are observed in the spectrum when sunlight is described. In 1860, physicist Gustav Kirchhoff and chemist, Robert Bunsen, observed that the dark lines in the spectrum of the Sun correspond to the light lines in the spectra of known gases, corresponding to unique chemical elements.",

He worked with the chemist Edward Frankland to investigate the spectra of the elements at various temperatures and pressures but was unable to connect the yellow lines in the Sun's spectrum to those of the elements that were then known. He later stated the line represented a new element, called helium, from the Greek Helios, the sun god. In 1885, Edward C. Pickering ran the stellar spectrum classification program at the Harvard College Observatory, where a team of computer girls, notably Williamina Fleming, Antonia Maury, and Annie Jump Cannon, classified the spectra recorded on photographic plates. In 1890, a catalog of more than 10,000 stars was compiled, grouped into thirteen spectral types. In 1924, Cannon expanded the catalog to nine volumes with more than 250,000 stars, developing the Harvard Classification Scheme used worldwide in 1922. In 1895, George Ellery Hale and James E. Keeler, along with ten fellow editors from Europe and United States, founded The Astrophysical Journal. The journal is intended to fill gaps in journals in astronomy and physics, providing a venue for the publication of articles on the applications of the spectroscope in astronomy; laboratory research closely related to astronomical physics; experiments on solar radiation and absorption; the theory of the Sun, Moon, planets, comets, meteors and nebulae; and instrumentation for telescopes and laboratories.

During the Middle Ages, Italy experienced sociopolitical collapse amid costly barbarian invasions, but in the 11th century many Italian city-states and maritime republics rose to prosperity through shipping, commerce, and banking, laying the foundations for modern capitalism.",

Most of Central Italy remained under the control of the theocratic Papal States, while Southern Italy was feudal until the 19th century, as a result of a succession of Byzantine, Arab, Norman, Spanish and Bourbon conquests in the region. The Renaissance started in Italy and spread across Europe, bringing with it new interests in humanism, science, exploration and art. During this time Italian culture flourished, and produced famous scholars, artists and polymaths such as Leonardo da Vinci, Galileo, Michelangelo and Machiavelli. Also famous Italian explorers such as Marco Polo, Christopher Columbus, Amerigo Vespucci and Giovanni da Verrazzano discovered new routes to the Far East and the New World, which aided the European Age of Exploration. However, Italy's commercial and political power diminished with the opening of the Atlantic trade route and the route to the Indian Ocean via the Cape of Good Hope across the Mediterranean. Again, the Italian city-states engaged in bloody wars, culminating in the Italian Wars of the 15th and 16th centuries, which eventually exhausted them, with no one emerging as the dominant force. The weakened rulers soon fell victim to the conquests of European powers such as France, Spain and Austria. In the mid-19th century, a movement arose to support Italian nationalism and independence from foreign control. This movement led to a revolutionary political upheaval called the Risorgimento to unite the countries in Italy. After many failed attempts, the Italian War of Independence and the Thousand Expedition finally unified the countries of Italy in 1861, and are now a major power after centuries of foreign domination.",

It was the first non-primordial radioactive element to be isolated: polonium, radium and radon were observed before actinium, but were isolated only recently in 1902. Actinium gave its name to the actinide series, a group of 15 elements similar to actinium and lawrencium on the periodic table. It is also sometimes considered the first 7th period transition metal, although lawrencium is less common in that position. A soft, silvery-white, radioactive metal, actinium reacts rapidly with oxygen and moisture in air to form a white layer of actinium oxide that prevents further oxidation. Like most of the lanthanides and actinides, actinium has an oxidation state of +3 in almost all of its chemical compounds. Actinium is found only in trace amounts in uranium and thorium ores as the isotope 227Ac, \u200b\u200bwhich decays with a half-life of 21.772 years, with predominantly emission of beta and occasionally alpha particles, and 228Ac, which is beta active with a half-life of 6.15 hours. One ton of natural uranium in its ore contains about 0.2 milligrams of actinium-227, and one tonne of natural thorium contains about 5 nanograms of actinium-228. The similar physical and chemical properties of actinium and lanthanum make it impractical to separate actinium from its ores. Instead, the element is prepared, in milligram amounts, by irradiating 226Ra neutrons in a nuclear reactor. Due to its rarity, high price and radioactivity, actinium has no significant industrial uses. Current applications include neutron sources and agents for radiotherapy targeting cancer cells in the body.

Around 1899, Debierne described the substance as similar to titanium and (in 1900) as similar to thorium. Friedrich Oskar Giesel independently discovered actinium in 1902 as a substance similar to lanthanum and called it \"emanium\" in 1904. After comparing the half-lives of the substances determined by Debierne, Harriet Brooks in 1904, and Otto Hahn and Otto Sackur in 1905 , Debierne's choice of name for the new element was retained out of consideration of seniority, despite the conflicting chemical properties he claimed for this element at different times. Articles published in the 1970s and later pointed out that Debierne's results published in 1904 contradicted those reported in 1899 and 1900. Furthermore, the chemistry of actinium known today precludes its presence as anything other than a minor constituent of Debierne's results in 1899 and 1900. In fact, the chemistry he reported makes it probable he had, by accident, identified protactinium, which would not be discovered for another fourteen years, only to have it disappear due to hydrolysis and adsorption on his laboratory equipment. This has led some authors to suggest that Giesel himself should be credited with the discovery. A cooler vision of scientific discovery was proposed by Adloff. He suggested that criticism of early publications had to be reconciled with the nascent state of radiochemistry: highlighting the caution with Debierne's claims in early newspapers, he noted that no one could argue that Debierne's substance did not contain actinium. Debierne, who is now credited by most historians as its discoverer, lost interest in the element and left the topic.",

While it includes a variety of interrelated historical processes and cultural phenomena (from fashion to modern warfare), modernity can also refer to the subjective or existential experience of existing situations and their impact on human culture, institutions, and politics (Berman 2010, 15\u2013 36). As a historical event, modernity refers to periods of criticism or rejection of tradition; prioritizing individualism, freedom and legal equality; belief in social, scientific, and technological progress, and human perfection; rationalization and professionalization, the shift from feudalism (or agrarianism) to capitalism and a market economy; industrialization, urbanization, and secularization; the formation of the nation-state and its subordinate institutions (eg representative democracy, public education, modern bureaucracy); and various forms of reconnaissance (Foucault 1995, 170\u201377).

After being redefined in 2019, the definition of the meter unit, as stated in the ninth edition of the SI Brochure, is as follows. The meter, symbolized by m, is the SI unit of length. This unit is defined by obtaining a fixed numerical value of the speed of light in a vacuum c of 299,792,458 when expressed in units of m\u22c5s\u22121, with the definition of second being determined with respect to the cesium frequency \u2206\u03bdCs. The meter was originally defined in 1793 as one ten millionth of the distance from the equator to the North Pole along the great circle, so that the circumference of the Earth is approximately 40,000 km. In 1799, the meter was redefined in terms of a prototype meter bar (the actual bar used was changed in 1889). In 1960, the meter was redefined in terms of the specific number of wavelengths of a specific krypton-86 emission line. The current definition was adopted in 1983 and modified slightly in 2002 to make it clear that the meter is a proper measure of length. The etymological root of the word meter can be traced to the Greek verb \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03ad\u03c9 (metreo) (measure, count or compare) and the noun \u03bc\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd (metron) (measure), which were used for physical measurement, for poetic meter and by extension for moderation or avoidance. extremism (as in \"measured in your response\"). This range of usage is also found in Latin (metior, mensura), French (m\u00e8tre, mesure), English, and other languages. The Greek word comes from the Proto-Indo-European root *meh\u2081- 'to measure'.

The meter was originally defined by the French Academy of Sciences (Acad\u00e9mie des sciences) as 110 000 000 distances along the surface of the Earth from the North Pole to the equator via the Paris meridian in 1791, and on 7 April 1795 France adopted the meter as the official distance for length.Uncertainty in the measurement of this distance led the International Bureau of Measures and Scales (BIPM - Bureau International des Poids et Mesures) to define 1 meter as the distance between two lines on a platinum-iridium bar kept at S\u00e8vres, France in 1889. In 1960, when the laser was introduced, the 11th General Conference on Measures and Scales (CGPM - Conf\u00e9rence G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Poids et Mesures) changed the definition of the meter as 1.650 .763.73 times the wavelength of the orange-red light spectrum of krypton-86 atoms in s a vacuum. In 1983, the BIPM defined the meter as the distance traveled by light through a vacuum in 1299 792 458 seconds (the speed of light is set at 299,792,458 meters per second). Since the speed of light in a vacuum is the same everywhere, this definition is more universal than the distance measured around the Earth or a certain length of metal rod. Therefore, if the metal bar is lost or destroyed, standard meter lengths can still be repeated in any laboratory. In addition, meters can theoretically be measured more precisely than other sizes. SI prefixes can be used to denote decimal multiples and submultiples of meters, as shown in the table below. Long distances are usually expressed in km, astronomical units (149.6 Gm), light years (10 Pm), or parsecs (31 Pm), not in Mm, Gm, Tm, Pm, Em, Zm or Ym; \"30 cm\", \"30 m\" and \"300 m\" are more common than \"3 dm\", \"3 checkers\" and \"3 hm\".",

The systematic names are sulfanediides and sulfide(2\u2212), valid IUPAC names, defined according to substitutive and additive nomenclature. However, the name sulfide is also used in compositional IUPAC nomenclature regardless of the nature of the bonds involved. Examples of such names are selenium disulfide and titanium sulfide, which contain no sulfide ions at all. Sulfide is also used non-systematically, to describe compounds which release hydrogen sulfide on acidification, or compounds containing sulfur in some form, such as dimethyl sulfide. \"Hydrogen sulfide\" itself is an example of a non-systematic name for this property. However, it is also a trivial name, and the IUPAC preferred name for sulfane. Sulfides are not present in sufficient concentrations, even in highly alkaline water, undetectable at pH < ~15 (8 M NaOH). The sulfide anion can assimilate protons by recombination: Due to proton capture (H+), sulfides have a basic character. In aqueous solution, it has a pKb value of less than 0. Its conjugate acid is bisulfide (SH\u2212). In aqueous solutions, most of the sulfide ions are neutralized. After being treated with standard acid, the sulfides turn into hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and metal salts. Sulfide oxidation produces sulfur or sulfates. Metal sulfides react with non-metals including iodine, bromine and chlorine to form sulfur and metal salts.

One well-known example is the bright yellow species CdS or \"cadmium yellow\". The black tarnish that forms on pure silver is Ag2S. Such species are sometimes referred to as salts. Actually, the bonds in transition metal sulfides are covalent, which causes their semiconducting properties, which in turn is related to the brightness of their color. Some sulfides have practical applications such as pigments, solar cells, and as catalysts. Aspergillus niger plays a role in dissolving heavy metal sulfides. Many important metal ores are sulphides. Notable examples include: argentite (silver sulfide), cinnabar (mercury), galena (lead sulfide), molybdenite (molybdenum sulfide), pentlandite (nickel sulfide), realgar (arsenic sulfide), and stibnite (antimony), sphalerite (zinc sulfide). ), and pyrite (iron disulfide), as well as chalcopyrite (iron-copper sulfide). Dissolved free sulphides (H2S, HS\u2212 and S2\u2212) are very aggressive species in the corrosion of many metals such as steel, stainless steel and copper. Sulfides present in aqueous solutions are responsible for stress corrosion cracking (SCC) in steel, also known as sulphide stress cracking. Corrosion is a major concern in many industrial installations of sulfide processing: sulfide ore plants, deep oil wells, bulk oil pipelines, Kraft paper mills.

If it sublimes, then there will be no liquid for electrolysis. Magnesium and aluminum oxides have very high melting points making them difficult to electrolyze in a simple laboratory.

Since December 2, 1975 the kingdom of Laos changed to the Republic of Laos. Laos is a communist country with a head of government in the form of a president named Thongloun Sisoulith and assisted by a prime minister named Phankam Viphavanh. When viewed from the point of view of Political Geography, the location of the territory of the country of Laos which does not have sea areas or beaches is known as a land-lock area. This condition is considered unfavorable in terms of defense and security, especially from attacks or invasions by other nations. Laos has fertile river valleys that produce many agricultural and plantation crops, especially rice, coffee and tobacco. It has mineral mining resources, such as tin, copper, gold and silver. Its territory is dominated by hills and mountains which are covered in dense forest, thus producing wood as one of its commodities. Socio-cultural potential consists of various ethnic groups with various cultures, most of the people still adhere to tradition, have a national language, namely Lao.",

Laos is one of the five communist countries in the world. Its area is around 236,800 km2 with a population of around 6.6 million people. Joined ASEAN since 1997, but this landlocked country only opened itself wide with other countries in 2004. The first step taken by Laos in opening up was to attract foreign capital. Laos has repeatedly revised its foreign investment law, as well as allowing foreign companies to transfer profits out of Laos. Foreign investors are also permitted to establish companies with pure capital or joint ventures. The Lao government does not even collect taxes on foreign companies for the first five years of business in Laos. To boost the economy, Laos establishes several economic zones, increases international trade and enhances regional cooperation. The main livelihood of the Lao population is in the agricultural sector. The main agricultural products are rice, corn, tobacco, cotton, coffee and citrus fruits. Agricultural areas are generally located in lowland areas, especially on the banks of the Mekong river. The Mekong River is the lifeblood of the Laotian economy which Laos uses to produce hydroelectric power. The hydroelectric power produced is then sold by Laos to neighboring countries such as Vietnam and Thailand. In 2012, the Lao government established the Laos Trade Center portal which provides information regarding the country's imports and exports. Along with the opening up of the economy, Laos's economy grew by 7.1% from 2001-2010 and is expected to increase by 7.6% from 2011-2015. It is not an impossible number if you look at the growth of Laos' Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2012 which reached 8.1%.",

But many other terms are also used, such as: mantrayana, secret mantra teaching, esoteric Buddhism. Vajrayana is a teaching that developed from Mahayana Buddhism, and differs in practice, not philosophy. In Vajrayana teachings, meditation practice is often preceded by a short mantra recitation and visualization. The term \"Vajrayana\" comes from the word vajra which in Sanskrit means 'thunder' or 'diamond'. Vajra symbolizes diamond as the hardest element on Earth, so the term Vajrayana can mean \"Indestructible and changeless Vehicle\". The philosophy of Buddhism can be divided into two: Hinayana/Pratimokshayana (one of which is Theravada) and Mahayana. Hinayana emphasizes attainment as an Arahant, whereas Mahayana emphasizes attainment as a Bodhisattva. Tantrayana which is part of Mahayana is also often known by the name of the Bodhisattva path. Hinayana can be divided into Vaibhashika and Sautrantika. Whereas Mahayana is divided into Cittamatra and Madhyamika. This Madhyamaka consists of Rangtong (which includes Sautrantika and Prasangika) and Shentong (Yogacara-Madhyamaka). These four Buddhist philosophies (Vaibhasika, Sautrantika, Cittamatra, and Madhyamika) have existed since the time of Gautama Buddha, arising from the different beliefs, different levels of understanding, different attainments, and realizations of the Buddha's disciples. Vaibhasika and Sautrantika teachings are widely found in Thailand, Burma, Sri Lanka and Cambodia. This Cittamatra teaching can be found in China, Taiwan, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Tibet and its surroundings.

In several countries (especially in Asia), there are many assumptions that Vajrayana is a mystical teaching, full of occult. This is actually not true. In Vajrayana, there are many methods of practice. Indeed, there are many Vajrayana practitioners who have extraordinary abilities, but this is not something mystical. This is actually a by-product of the practice, and it should be ignored. As the Buddha said, what can save us at the time of death is the Dharma, not the powers we have.

The by-product of this ability (siddhi) will often increase our arrogance (me-ness), which we actually have to get rid of, and is not something to be proud of.",

Nearly all of this argon is radiogenic argon-40 derived from the decay of potassium-40 in the Earth's crust. In the universe, argon-36 is by far the most common isotope of argon, being the argon isotope produced by stellar nucleosynthesis in supernovae. In addition, argon is the most abundant noble gas in the Earth's crust, comprising 0.00015% of the crust. The name argon is derived from the Greek \u03b1\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf\u03bd, the singular form of \u03b1\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 meaning \"lazy\" or \"inactive\", in reference to the fact that this element almost never undergoes chemical reactions. The complete octet (eight electrons) in its outer electron shell makes argon stable and resistant to bonding with other elements. Its triple point temperature of 83.8058 K is the fixed point defined in the 1990 International Temperature Scale. Argon is produced industrially by the distillation of the liquid air fraction. Argon is widely used as an inert shielding gas in welding and other high-temperature industrial processes where normally unreactive materials become reactive; for example, an argon atmosphere is used in graphite electric furnaces to prevent the graphite from burning. Argon gas has also been used in incandescent and fluorescent lamps, and other types of discharge tubes. Argon makes a distinctive blue-green gas laser.",

Although argon is a noble gas, it has been found to have the ability to form several compounds. For example, the formation of argon fluorohydride (HArF), an argon compound with fluorine and hydrogen that is stable below 17 K, was reported by researchers from the University of Helsinki in 2000. Although neutral argon compounds in the ground state are currently limited to HArF, argon can be forms clathrate with water when its atoms are trapped in a lattice of water molecules.

The science related to the study of life is biology. Life exists in various forms of organisms on Earth, such as plants, animals, fungi, protists, archaea and bacteria. Living organisms undergo metabolism, maintain homeostasis, have the ability to grow, respond to stimuli, reproduce, and\u2014through natural selection\u2014adapt to their environment in successive generations. More complex living organisms can communicate in a variety of ways. The general characteristics of these organisms are carbon- and water-based cells, with complex organization and heritable genetic information. Abiogenesis is the natural process by which life arises from non-living matter, such as simple organic compounds. The current scientific hypothesis states that the transition from non-living to living entities is not a single event, but a gradual process of increasing complexity. Life on Earth first appeared 4.28 billion years ago, after the oceans formed 4.41 billion years ago, and shortly after Earth formed 4.54 billion years ago. The earliest known forms of life are bacterial microfossils. Researchers generally think that life today originated in the RNA world, even though RNA-based life may not have been the first life that ever existed.

The cell is considered the structural and functional unit of life. There are two types of cells, namely prokaryotes and eukaryotes, which consist of a cytoplasm enclosed in a membrane and contain many biomolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids. Cells reproduce by cell division, which is the process when the parent cell divides into two or more daughter cells. In the past, there have been many attempts to define what is meant by \"life\" through outdated concepts such as odic style, hylemorphism, spontaneous generation, and vitalism, which have now been disproved by biological discoveries. Aristotle is considered to be the first person to classify organisms. Carolus Linnaeus later introduced the binomial nomenclature system for classifying species. Later, new groups and categories of life were discovered, such as cells and microorganisms, which revised the structure of the relationships among living organisms. Although currently life is only known on Earth, scientists speculate the existence of extraterrestrial life. Meanwhile, artificial life is a computer simulation or man-made reconstruction of all aspects of life, which is often used to examine systems related to natural life.

In the past, research on nutrition was limited to preventing malnutrition and determining basic nutritional requirements (standards) in living things. This figure for basic nutritional needs is known internationally as the Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA). Along with scientific developments in the medical and molecular biology fields, medical evidence shows that RDA is not sufficient to maintain optimal body function and prevent or help treat chronic diseases. Medical evidence shows that the root of many chronic diseases is oxidative stress caused by an excess of free radicals in the body. The use of nutrients at an optimal level, known as Optimal Daily Allowance (ODA), is proven to be able to prevent and treat oxidative stress thereby helping to prevent chronic diseases. This optimal level can be achieved if the amount and composition of nutrients used are appropriate. In disease management, the use of nutrition as a complementary medicine can help the effectiveness of treatment and at the same time overcome the side effects of treatment. Therefore, nutrition / nutrition is closely related to optimal health and increased quality of life. The results of measuring can be done with the method of anthropometry.

It was the first non-primordial radioactive element to be isolated: polonium, radium and radon were observed before actinium, but were isolated only recently in 1902. Actinium gave its name to the actinide series, a group of 15 elements similar to actinium and lawrencium on the periodic table. It is also sometimes considered the first 7th period transition metal, although lawrencium is less common in that position. A soft, silvery-white, radioactive metal, actinium reacts rapidly with oxygen and moisture in air to form a white layer of actinium oxide that prevents further oxidation. Like most of the lanthanides and actinides, actinium has an oxidation state of +3 in almost all of its chemical compounds. Actinium is found only in trace amounts in uranium and thorium ores as the isotope 227Ac, \u200b\u200bwhich decays with a half-life of 21.772 years, with predominantly emission of beta and occasionally alpha particles, and 228Ac, which is beta active with a half-life of 6.15 hours.

Friedrich Oskar Giesel independently discovered actinium in 1902 as a substance similar to lanthanum and called it \"emanium\" in 1904. After comparing the half-lives of the substances determined by Debierne, Harriet Brooks in 1904, and Otto Hahn and Otto Sackur in 1905 , Debierne's choice of name for the new element was retained out of consideration of seniority, despite the conflicting chemical properties he claimed for this element at different times. Articles published in the 1970s and later pointed out that Debierne's results published in 1904 contradicted those reported in 1899 and 1900. Furthermore, the chemistry of actinium known today precludes its presence as anything other than a minor constituent of Debierne's results in 1899 and 1900. In fact, the chemistry he reported makes it probable he had, by accident, identified protactinium, which would not be discovered for another fourteen years, only to have it disappear due to hydrolysis and adsorption on his laboratory equipment. This has led some authors to suggest that Giesel himself should be credited with the discovery. A cooler vision of scientific discovery was proposed by Adloff. He suggested that criticism of early publications had to be reconciled with the nascent state of radiochemistry: highlighting the caution with Debierne's claims in early newspapers, he noted that no one could argue that Debierne's substance did not contain actinium.

King Kazimierz the Great died in 1370 without leaving a male heir. During the reign of the Polish kings of the Jagiellon dynasty, from the 14th to the 16th century, Poland cultivated close relations with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, underwent a Renaissance, and continued efforts to expand its sovereign territory culminating in the creation of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in in 1569. At first the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was able to maintain the level of prosperity achieved by Poland during the Jagiellon dynasty by implementing a highly developed system of aristocratic democracy. However, since the mid-17th century, this gigantic country entered a period of decline due to war and the collapse of the political system. At the end of the 18th century, attempts at domestic reform were attempted, especially by passing the Constitution of May 3, 1791, but the surrounding foreign powers did not allow the reform process to run smoothly. The independence of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth of Nations ended in 1795, after the Russian Empire, Kingdom of Prussia, and the Austrian Habsburg Monarchy overthrew and divided the country. From 1795 to 1918, no Polish state was truly independent, despite the staunch Polish resistance movements.

As a subdiscipline of biology and chemistry, biochemistry can be divided into three areas: structural biology, enzymes, and metabolism. Over the last decades of the 20th century, biochemistry has succeeded in explaining life processes through these three subdisciplines. Almost all fields of life sciences are being discovered and developed through methodological and biochemical research. Biochemistry focuses on understanding the basic chemistry that enables biological molecules to give rise to the processes that occur within living cells and between cells, which in turn is closely related to understanding tissues and organs, and the structure and function of organisms. Biochemistry is closely related to molecular biology which studies the molecular mechanisms of biological phenomena. Much of biochemistry deals with the structure, function, and interactions of biological macromolecules, such as proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and lipids. These molecules make up the structure of cells and perform many functions related to life. The chemical properties of cells also depend on the reactions of small molecules and ions. They can be inorganic (eg water and metal ions) or organic (eg amino acids used to synthesize proteins) compounds. The mechanism used by cells to utilize energy from their environment through chemical reactions is known as metabolism. Biochemical findings are applied primarily in medicine, nutrition, and agriculture. In medicine, biochemists investigate the causes and cures of disease. The science of nutrition studies how to maintain health and fitness and the effects of malnutrition. In agriculture, biochemists investigate soil and fertilizers. Improving crop cultivation, crop storage, as well as pest control are also the goals of biochemistry applications.",

In this sense, the history of biochemistry can go back to ancient Greece. However, biochemistry as a specific scientific discipline started around the 19th century, or earlier, depending on which aspect of biochemistry is focused on. Some suggest that biochemistry may have started with the discovery of the first enzyme molecule, namely diastase (now called amylase), in 1833 by Anselme Payen, while others consider Eduard Buchner's demonstration of the first complex biochemical process, namely the alcoholic fermentation of a free-form extract. cell in 1897 as a sign of the birth of biochemistry. Some might also point to the influential work published in 1842 by Justus von Liebig, Animal chemistry, or, Organic chemistry in its applications to physiology and pathology, which presented the chemical theory of metabolism, as the beginning of biochemistry, or even as early as the 19th century studies. 18 on fermentation and respiration by Antoine Lavoisier. Many other pioneers have been called the founders of modern biochemistry for helping to unravel the complexities of biochemistry. Emil Fischer, who studied protein chemistry, and F. Gowland Hopkins, who studied enzymes and biochemical dynamics, represent two examples of early biochemists. The term \"biochemistry\" itself comes from a combination of biology and chemistry. In 1877, Felix Hoppe-Seyler used the term (biochemie in German) as a synonym for physiological chemistry in the preface to the first edition of the Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physiologische Chemie (Journal of Physiological Chemistry) when he suggested establishing an institute dedicated to this field of study.

In the periodic table, oxygen is a group VIA non-metallic element (chalcogen) and can easily react with almost all other elements (mainly being oxides). At standard temperature and pressure, two oxygen atoms bond to form O (dioxygen), a colorless, tasteless, and odorless gas. Oxygen is the third most abundant element in the universe by mass (after hydrogen and helium) and the most abundant element in the Earth's crust. By volume, 20.9% of Earth's atmosphere is oxygen. All groups of organic molecules in living things, such as proteins, carbohydrates and fats, contain the element oxygen. The same goes for inorganic compounds found in animal shells, teeth and bones. Most of the oxygen in living things is in the form of water (H2O), an important compound in living things. Oxygen in the form O is produced from water by cyanobacteria, algae, and plants during photosynthesis, and is used in cellular respiration by nearly all living things. Oxygen is toxic to anaerobic organisms, which were the predominant form of life in the early days of life's evolution. O then began accumulating in the atmosphere around 2.5 billion years ago. There is also another allotrope of oxygen, namely ozone (O). The ozone layer in the atmosphere helps protect the biosphere from ultraviolet radiation, but at the Earth's surface it is a pollutant that is a by-product of smog. Oxygen was independently discovered by Carl Wilhelm Scheele in Uppsala in 1773 and Joseph Priestley in Wiltshire in 1774.

The term oxygen was coined by Antoine Lavoisier in 1777, whose experiments with oxygen disproved the famous phlogiston theories of combustion and corrosion. He also succeeded in explaining the role of oxygen in combustion. Oxygen is industrially produced by the gradual distillation of liquid air, by using zeolites to separate carbon dioxide and nitrogen from air, or the electrolysis of water, etc. Oxygen is used in the production of steel, plastics, and textiles. It is also used as a rocket propellant, for oxygen therapy, and as a life support in airplanes, submarines, spaceflight, and diving. One of the first known experiments on the relationship between combustion and air was performed by Philo of Byzantium, a 2nd century BC Greek writer on mechanics. In his work, Pneumatica, Philo observed that turning the crucible over a burning candle and placing water under the neck of the vessel caused the water to rise up the neck. Philo wrongly assumed that part of the air in the vessel was converted into classical elemental fire and thus escaped through the pores in the glass. Initially, many scientists thought that air was one of the four elements and not a mixture of various gases, as scientists know today. Therefore, initially scientists did not know the existence of oxygen as a component of air. Leonardo da Vinci who lived 1452\u20131519 observed that some air is used in the processes of combustion and respiration, and without it neither fire nor living things would die. At the end of the 17th century, Robert Boyle proved that air is necessary for the combustion process. The English chemist John Mayow complemented Boyle's work by showing that only a portion of the air component, which he called spiritus nitroaereus or nitroaereus, was required for combustion.",

Scientists often use the term fungus as a synonym for Fungi. The common people refer to most members of the fungi as mushrooms, molds, yeasts, or yeasts, although it is often the external appearance that is visible, not the species itself. The difficulty in recognizing fungi is more or less due to the alternation of offspring that have completely different appearances (remember metamorphosis in insects or frogs). Fungi reproduce both sexually and asexually. Sexual propagation is by means of: two hyphae from different fungi fuse and form a zygote, then the zygote grows into a fruiting body, while asexual propagation is by forming spores, budding or fragmentation of hyphae. Fungi have a spore box called a sporangium. Inside the sporangium are spores. An example of a fungus that forms spores is Rhizopus. An example of a fungus that forms buds is Saccharomyces. Fungal hyphae can collapse and individual fragments can grow into fruiting bodies. The study of fungi is called mycology (from the Greek roots \u03bc\u03c5\u03ba\u03b5\u03c2, \"mucus\", and \u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03bf\u03c3, \"knowledge\", \"symbol\").

Like plants, most fungi also grow in the soil and, in fungi, form fruiting bodies, which sometimes resemble lichen-like plants. Fungi are now considered a separate kingdom, distinct from both plants and animals, which appear to have split up about a billion years ago (around the start of the Neoproterozoic Era). Some morphological, biochemical and genetic characteristics are shared with other organisms, while others are unique to fungi, clearly separating the fungi from the other kingdoms: Characteristics that are shared: Unique features: Most fungi do not have efficient systems for transport of water and nutrients over long distances, like xylem and phloem in many plants. To overcome this limitation, some fungi, such as Armillaria, form rhizomorphs, which resemble and perform functions similar to plant roots. As eukaryotes, fungi possess biosynthetic pathways for producing terpenes that use mevalonic acid and pyrophosphate as chemical building blocks. Plants and some other organisms have additional terpene biosynthetic pathways in their chloroplasts, structures that fungi and animals do not. Fungi produce several secondary metabolites that are structurally similar or identical to those made by plants.

Abkhazia is located on the east coast of the Black Sea, bordering the Russian Federation to the north. With Georgia, the border is in the Samegrelo-Zemo Svaneti area to the east. The status of Abkhazia is a central issue of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict and Georgian-Russian relations. It is recognized as a state by Russia, Venezuela, Nicaragua, Nauru and Syria. While Georgia has no control over Abkhazia, the Georgian government and most United Nations member states consider Abkhazia de jure part of Georgia, with Georgia retaining a formal government. The region had autonomous status within the Georgian SSR at the time the Soviet Union began to disintegrate in the late 1980s. Ethnic tensions simmered between the region's titular Abkhaz ethnicity and the Georgians the largest single ethnic group at the time and culminated in the 1992-1993 War in Abkhazia, which resulted in Georgia's loss of control over most of Abkhazia and the ethnic cleansing of Georgians from Abkhazia. Despite a 1994 ceasefire agreement and years of negotiations, the dispute remains unresolved. The long-term presence of a United Nations Observe Mission and a Russian-led Commonwealth of Independent States peacekeeping force failed to prevent outbreaks of violence on several occasions. In August 2008, Abkhazian and Russian forces fought war against Georgian forces, which led to Russia's official recognition of Abkhazia, the cancellation of a 1994 armistice agreement and the termination of the UN mission.

Ugamo Malim is a continuation of the ancient religious system that was first adopted by the Batak people long before the arrival of Protestantism, Islam and Catholicism. This ancient religious system is inherent in the way of life of its people without the label \"religion\" like other organized religions in the world. The emergence of the revitalization process of Ugamo Malim during the leadership of Sisingamangaraja XII was inseparable from the turbulent social, economic and political context at that time. Seeing the magnitude of the rocky influence of other religions and cultures, Sisingamangaraja XII took steps to save the Batak religious system by instituting it and giving it the name Ugamo Malim. Reference needed] The Batak people interpret religiosity by treating nature as the foundation of life and Mulajadi Nabolon's gift that must be maintained, both as source of life for his existence as well as a source of livelihood for his survival. The spirituality of caring for the created world is combined with gratitude and surrender to Mulajadi Nabaolon and is maintained with rituals that are aligned with the chronology of life and livelihood. Among these rituals is the offering ceremony (Batak language: pelean) to Mulajdi Nabolon. The activity of preparing ritual equipment is carried out very carefully according to the procedures and provisions referred to as \"patik\".",

The term \"parugamo\" became popular again in the Batak Lands when other religions grew in the Batak lands and became an identity that existed with the original Batak religiosity belief system. In the Batak language, people who follow and live up to the teachings of Ugamo Malim are called \"parugamo malim\", abbreviated as Parmalim. In the Batak language, a group of people who carry out one activity with one goal is called \"punguan\". The association of Ugamo Malim adherents is also known as \"punguan parmalim\". The association in question could be: During the Sisingamangaraja dynasty, there was Bale Pasogit Pamujian in Bakkara. This place was the center of worship and spirituality for the Batak people at that time. However, during the Toba War which destroyed Bakkara, the Bale Pasogit Pamujian was also burned. Due to the influx of foreign influences and the emergence of shocks to the social order as a result of Dutch colonialism and the activities of spreading Christianity, Sisingamangaraja XII instructed his students to establish a \"bale pasogit\" later as a place for \"nabolon worship\" (Indonesian: worship of the Supreme). which gathered loyal people with faith in Mulajadi Nabolon. citation needed] After the death of Sisingamangaraja XII on June 17, 1907, the mandate was again reminded by a figure calling himself Nasiakbagi.

Baptism also symbolizes death with Jesus. By going into the water, the baptized person is symbolized as having died. When he came out of the water again, it was described as his resurrection. The Apostle Paul in the Letter to the Romans describes it as follows: \"Or do you not know that all of us who were baptized into Christ were baptized into his death? Thus we were buried with him by baptism into death, so that, just like Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we shall live in newness of life.\" (Romans 6:3-4). The word Baptism (derived from Greek: \u03b2\u03b1\u03c0\u03c4\u03af\u03b6\u03c9, translit. baptizo) its origin is the word \u03b2\u03ac\u03c0\u03c4\u03c9 - bapto, which means to immerse. Then it becomes baptizo which implies that something is soaked or dipped in water or a specific solution (liquid).. The essence of the term baptiz\u014d itself is not in the method (sprinkling or immersion), but in the process or in the effect produced from the baptism. In the religious sense itself, it means cleansing oneself from sin or, more simply, purification in the Christian life. On the other hand, it can be expressed as meaning that the person is a follower of Christ. In some religions such as Christianity, Mandaeanism, Sikhism, and some ancient sects of Judaism, baptism is a purification ritual using water. This Christian ritual was started by John the Baptist, who according to the Bible baptized Jesus in the Jordan River. Baptism is done with water.

Gospel of Mark 10:13-16, etc.). However, there are also churches that only baptize adults who have claimed to believe, for example Adventist churches, Pentecostals and Baptist churches. Usually, these churches practice immersion baptism. In this case, the priest and the candidate for baptism enter a pool and the person being baptized is immersed in the water. Apart from that, there are several churches that have to go through a process of confession of faith (sidi), for example the Apostles' Creed. Confession of faith is done before being baptized. Churches that do this include the Catholic Church, the Puritan Church, the Presbyterian Church, the Reformed or Calvinist Church, the Lutheran Church, and several other Protestant churches. The formula for washing (baptizontes) must be based on the Bible. The formulation of Baptism in the Bible itself must be \"in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.\". which represents the Oneness of the Triune God But other than a formula, for example \"In the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, who is Jesus Christ\", then Baptism performed is still invalid. Because it is not in accordance with Matthew 28:19-20. And not in accordance with the formulation of the Triune God. It is as if Jesus Christ contains 3 persons, namely the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. So there is a need for re-baptism. But on the other hand, for the case of baptizing in \"in the name of Jesus\" alone, especially Peter's Baptism in Acts 2:38-39; 10:44-48; and Paul in Acts 19:1-8 actually does not represent the presence of the Triune God.",

The metatarsal-phalangeal joint at the base of the thumb is the most frequently affected site (approximately 50% of cases). However, this symptom may also present as tophi, kidney stones, or urate nephropathy. This condition is caused by an increase in uric acid levels in the blood. Uric acid crystallizes, and these crystals deposit in joints, tendons, and surrounding tissues. The clinical diagnosis is confirmed by looking for the characteristic crystals in the joint fluid. Treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), steroids, or colchicine can reduce inflammation. When the acute attack subsides, uric acid levels are usually reduced by lifestyle changes, and for those with recurrent attacks, allopurinol or probenecid provides long-term prevention. The frequency of gout has increased in recent decades, affecting around 1-2% of the Western population at some point in their lives. This increase is thought to be due to an increase in risk factors in the population, such as metabolic syndrome, longer life expectancy and changes in diet. Historically, gout has been known as the \"disease of kings\" or \"disease of the rich\". Gout can take many forms, although the most common is the recurring attacks of acute inflammatory arthritis (red, tender joints that are painful and hot and swollen).

Low levels of uric acid for a long time (hyperuricemia) can cause other symptomatology, including the deposition of uric acid crystals that do not cause pain called tophi. Extensive tophi can lead to chronic arthritis due to bone erosion. Increased levels of uric acid can also cause crystal deposition in the kidneys, causing stone formation and subsequent urate nephropathy. Hyperuricemia is a cause of gout. This condition can occur for a variety of reasons, including diet, genetic predisposition, or decreased excretion of uric acid salts. Reduced excretion of uric acid in the kidneys is the cause of hyperuricemia which accounts for 90% of the main cases, whereas excess production only occurs in less than 10% of cases. Approximately 10% of hyperuricemia sufferers experience gout at some point in their life. However, the risk varies depending on the degree of hyperuricemia.

But the movement spread quickly to other parts of the Roman Empire, and at a time before Christianity was tolerated or made legal. Although the mainline Christian Church triumphed over Montanism over several generations, branding it a heresy, the sect persisted in isolated places until the 8th century. Some people draw parallels between Montanism and Pentecostalism (which some call Neo-Montanism). The most famous Montanist is definitely Tertullian, who was the most prominent Latin church writer before he converted to Montanism. The Montanist known as Montanis Montanus visited rural settlements in Asia Minor after his conversion, and taught and testified to what he said was the Word of God. However, his teachings were deemed heretical by the orthodox Church for a number of reasons. He claimed not only to have received a series of direct revelations from the Holy Ghost, but personally to be the incarnation of the paraclete mentioned in the Gospel of John 14:16. Montanus was accompanied by two women, Prisca, sometimes called Priscilla, and Maximilla, who also claimed to be the embodiments of the Holy Spirit that moved and inspired them. Wherever they went, the \"Three\" as they were called, spoke with ecstatic visions and urged their followers to fast and pray, so that they too would be able to have this personal revelation.

The response to this continuing revelation divided Christian communities, and more orthodox clergy generally struggled to suppress it. Bishop Apolinarius found the church in Ancyra split in two, and he opposed \"false prophecy\" (quoted by Eusebius 5.16.5). But there was serious doubt in Rome, and Pope Eleuterus even wrote letters in support of Montanism, although he later recanted (Tertullian, \"Adversus Praxean\" c.1, Trevett 58-59). Prisca confessed that Christ appeared to her in the form of a woman. When he was excommunicated, he cried out, \"I was driven like a wolf from the sheep. I am not a wolf: I am word and spirit and power.\" The most famous defender of the Montanists was clearly Tertullian, a former defender of the orthodox faith, who believed the new prophecy to be genuine and began to abandon what he called the \u201cchurch of many bishops\u201d (On Modesty). Although the orthodox Christian church triumphed over Montanism within a few generations, inscriptions in the Tembris valley in northern Phrygia, which are dated between 249 and 279, openly declare their allegiance to Montanism.A letter from Jerome to Marsela, written in 385, refutes the claim that the Montanists had disturbed him (letter 41) A group of \"Tertullianists\" continued to have a presence in Carthage.

In some respects, zinc is chemically similar to magnesium: the two elements exhibit only one normal oxidation state (+2), and the Zn2+ and Mg2+ ions are similar in size. notes 1] Zinc is the 24th most abundant element in the Earth's crust and has five stable isotopes. The most common zinc ore is sphalerite (zinc alloy), a zinc sulfide mineral. The largest applicable Lodes are in Australia, Asia and the United States. Zinc is refined through flotation of ore, roasting, and final extraction using electricity (electric extraction). Brass, an alloy of copper and zinc in various proportions, was used from the third millennium BC in the Aegean region and in areas that today include Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kalmykia, Turkmenistan and Georgia. In the second millennium BC, it was used in areas that today include West India, Uzbekistan, Iran, Syria, Iraq and Israel. Zinc metal was not produced on a large scale until the 12th century in India, although it was known to the ancient Romans and Greeks. The mines of Rajasthan have provided definitive evidence of zinc production since the 6th century BC. To date, the oldest evidence of pure zinc comes from Zawar, in Rajasthan, in the early 9th century AD when a refining process was used to make pure zinc.

The work of Luigi Galvani and Alessandro Volta discovered the electrochemical properties of zinc in 1800. Corrosion-resistant zinc plating of iron (hot-dip galvanization) is a major application for zinc. Other applications are in electric batteries, small nonstructural castings, and alloys such as brass. Various zinc compounds are commonly used, such as zinc carbonate and zinc gluconate (as dietary supplements), zinc chloride (in deodorants), zinc pyrithione (anti-dandruff shampoos), zinc sulfide (in luminescent paints), and dimethylzinc or diethylzinc in the organic laboratory. Zinc is an essential mineral, which is required for prenatal and postnatal development. Zinc deficiency affects around two billion people in developing countries and is associated with many diseases. In children, deficiency causes growth retardation, delayed sexual maturation, susceptibility to infection, and diarrhea. Enzymes with a zinc atom in the reactive center are widespread in biochemistry, such as alcohol dehydrogenase in humans. Excessive zinc consumption can cause ataxia, lethargy, and copper deficiency. Zinc is a bluish-white, lustrous diamagnetic metal, although the most common commercial grades of this metal have a dull finish. It is somewhat less dense than iron and has a hexagonal crystal structure, with a distorted hexagonal solid-state arrangement, in which each atom has six nearest neighbors (at a distance of 265.9 pm) in its own plane and another six at a greater distance (290.6 pm).

Elements used in electrochemical reactions are characterized by the number of electrons they have. In general, electrochemistry is divided into two groups, namely galvanic cells and electrolytic cells. Electrochemical reactions can take place spontaneously, that is, when two electrodes immersed in a liquid electrolyte are connected by an electric circuit. Electrochemistry is used for metal refining and plating as well as electrosynthesis. The electrochemical method is based on redox reactions that combine oxidation and reduction processes. This reaction is carried out at the same or different electrodes. Electrochemical systems are formed through electrochemical reactions elicited by electrochemical cells. Electrochemical cells are divided into two types, namely galvanic cells and electrolytic cells. Galvanic cells generate electricity due to spontaneous reactions, while electrolytic cells generate electricity due to non-spontaneous reactions. Redox is a term that describes changes in the oxidation number (oxidation state) of atoms in a chemical reaction. The term redox comes from two concepts, namely reduction and oxidation. An oxidizing agent is a substance that oxidizes another substance in a redox reaction. Meanwhile, a reducing agent is a substance that reduces another substance in a redox reaction. Corrosion is metal damage that occurs due to electrochemical reactions or direct chemical reactions. The most common corrosion events found are rust on iron, tarnish on silver, and green platinum that forms on copper and brass. The corrosion medium can be dry or wet. An example of corrosion that takes place in a dry medium is the rusting of iron metal by oxygen gas or by sulfur dioxide gas.

The basic principle of electrosynthesis is electrochemistry. The equipment used in the electrosynthesis process is two or three electrode rods connected to an electric current. Setting the speed of the reaction is done by adjusting the potential difference and the level of electric current density within the desired limits. Synthesis using the electrosynthesis method is easy to control and has a very low level of pollution. A gas transducer is a transducer whose function is to determine the presence or measure the quantity of a particular gas. One of the working principles that can be applied to gas transducers is the electrochemical gas sensor. The target gas will react to the electrochemical gas sensor and generate an electrical signal. The magnitude of the value of the electrical signal sent is proportional to the concentration of the gas. The electrochemical gas sensor consists of two electrodes, each of which functions as a sensing and measuring gas quantity. These two electrodes are separated by a thin layer of electrolyte. Before the gas comes into contact with the sensor, it passes through a thin capillary opening and undergoes diffusion along the hydrophobic barrier until it reaches the surface of the electrode. The hydrophobic barrier prevents leakage of the liquid electrolyte and generates a sufficient electrical signal at the sensing electrode. The electrochemical gas sensor also has a reference electrode whose job is to maintain a continuous electrochemical reaction that occurs on the surface of the electrode. This reference electrode creates a stable and constant potential difference at the sensing electrode. The target gas undergoes an electrochemical reaction resulting in the flow of current between the sensing and counter electrodes. The passage of electric charge in the electride is carried out by the electrolyte. Paracetamol can be made using electrochemical reduction using nitrobenzene as raw material.",

In capitalism, manifest itself is in conflict between the governing class (known as the bourgeoisie) who control the means of production and the working class (known as the proletariat) who can be made use of by selling their labor power in return for wages. Advancing the critical convention known as historical materialism, Marx predicted that, like previous socio-economic systems, capitalism would produce internal tensions that would lead to self-destruction and be replaced by a new system: socialism. For Marx, class antagonism under capitalism, which is part and parcel of its unstable and crisis-prone nature, would then lead the working class to develop a classless society, leading to their conquest of political power and thus consolidating a classless, communist society governed by producer associations. free. Marx actively pushed for its implementation, arguing that the working class must take revolutionary action to overthrow capitalism and bring about socio-economic emancipation.",

His work in economics formed the basis for much of today's understanding of labor and its relationship to capital, and later economic thought. Several intellectuals, trade unionists, artists and political parties around the world were influenced by the work of Marx, with some modifying or adapting his ideas. Marx is usually cited as one of the principal architects of modern social science. Marx was born on 5 May 1818 to Heinrich Marx (1777\u20131838) and Henriette Pressburg (1788\u20131863). He was born in Br\u00fcckengasse 664, Trier, a town then part of the Lower Rhine Province, Kingdom of Prussia. Marx is Jewish. His maternal grandfather was a Dutch rabbi, while his paternal line includes Trier rabbis from 1723, a role taken by his grandfather Meier Halevi Marx. His father, known as Herschel as a child, was the first in his family to receive a secondary education and he became a lawyer and lived a relatively affluent and middle-class life, with his family owning a number of Moselle vineyards. Prior to the birth of his son, and after the lifting of Jewish emancipation in the Rhineland, Herschel converted from Judaism to join the state religion of the Evangelical Church of Prussia, changing his first name from Herschel of Yiddish origin to Heinrich of German origin. Marx was a briefly abolished third cousin of the German Romance poet Heinrich Heine, who was also born into a German Jewish family in the Rhineland, who became an avid correspondent in his later life. Like most irreligious people, Heinrich was a figurehead of the Age of Enlightenment, interested in the ideas of the philosophers Immanuel Kant and Voltaire.",

The country has an area of \u200b\u200b30,689 square kilometers (11,849 sq mi) and a population of over 11.5 million, making it the 22nd most populous country in the world and the 6th most populous in Europe with a density of 376 per square kilometer (970/sq mi). The country's capital and largest city is Brussels; Other major cities include Antwerp, Gent, Brugge, Namur and Leuven. The country is a federal constitutional kingdom with a parliamentary system. The country is divided into three states: the Region of Flanders in the north, the Region of Wallonia in the south, and the Brussels-Capital Region. Within Belgium there are two main linguistic communities: the Dutch-speaking Flemish Community, which makes up about 60 percent of the Belgian population, and the French-speaking Community, which makes up about 40 percent of the population. The German-speaking community is small, numbering only about one percent, and is located in East Canton. The Brussels Capital Territory is officially bilingual in French and Dutch, although French is the dominant language. Belgium's linguistic diversity and related political conflicts are reflected in its complex system of government, which consists of six different governments. Belgium is one of the six founding countries of the European Union and its capital, Brussels, is the official host of the European Commission, European Union Council and European Council, as well as one of the two seats of the European Parliament (the other is located in Strasbourg).",

The difficulty in separating aluminum from oxygen in oxide ores (such as aluminum oxide) can be solved by mixing the compound with cryolite. Pure cryolite melts at 1012\u00b0C (1285 K) and mixing lowers the melting point of aluminum oxide, allowing aluminum to be extracted more easily in the electrolysis process. It still takes a large amount of energy to heat the required material and carry out the electrolysis process, but it is more energy efficient than melting the aluminum oxide itself. Natural cryolite is now too rare to be used in the process, so synthetic sodium aluminum fluoride is now used; These compounds are produced from the mineral fluorite. Cryolite deposits have been reported at Pikes Peak, Colorado; Mont Saint-Hilaire, Qu\u00e9bec; and in Miass, Russia. It has also been found in small amounts in Brazil, the Czech Republic, Namibia, Norway, Ukraine and several states in the United States.

In general, corrosion can be divided into wet corrosion and dry corrosion. Corrosion is caused by physical chemical, metallurgical, electrochemical and thermodynamic factors. Corrosion can be classified into eight, namely general corrosion, galvanic corrosion, crevice corrosion, well corrosion, grain boundary corrosion, selective corrosion, erosion corrosion, and stress corrosion. In everyday language, corrosion is called rust. The most common example of corrosion is the rusting of iron. In the event of corrosion, metal undergoes oxidation, while oxygen (air) undergoes reduction. Metal rust is generally in the form of oxides or carbonates. The chemical formula for iron rust is Fe2O3.nH2O, a brown-red solid. Corrosion is an electrochemical process. In iron corrosion, a certain part of the iron acts as the anode, where the iron undergoes oxidation. Fe(s) <--> Fe2+(aq) + 2e The electrons liberated at the anode flow to another part of the iron which acts as the cathode, where the oxygen is reduced. O2(g) + 4H+(aq) + 4e <--> 2H2O(l) or O2(g) + 2H2O(l) + 4e <--> 4OH-(aq) Iron(II) ions formed at the next anode oxidizes to form iron(III) ions which then form a hydrated oxide compound, namely iron rust. Regarding which part of the iron acts as the anode and which part acts as the cathode, it depends on various factors, such as impurities, or differences in the density of the metal. Corrosion can also be interpreted as an attack that damages metal because metal reacts chemically or electrochemically with the environment. There is another definition that says that corrosion is the opposite of the process of extracting metal from its mineral ore. For example, iron metal mineral ores in nature exist in the form of iron oxide or iron(II) sulfide compounds, after being extracted and processed, iron will be produced which is used to manufacture steel or alloy steel.",

The Voltaic series and the Nernst Equation will help to determine the possibility of corrosion. The speed of corrosion is very dependent on many factors, such as the presence or absence of an oxide layer, because the oxide layer can block the potential difference to other electrodes which will be very different if it is still clean of oxide. Corrosion on iron causes many losses, because goods or buildings that use iron are not durable. Corrosion on iron can be prevented by turning iron into stainless steel, but this process is expensive, so it is not suitable for most uses of iron. water and air. Paints containing lead and zinc will better protect the iron against corrosion. The painting must be perfect because if there are parts that are not covered by paint, then the iron under the paint will corrode. Building fences and bridges are usually protected from corrosion by painting. The plastic prevents contact of the iron with water and air. Household appliances are usually wrapped in plastic to prevent corrosion. Chrome provides a protective layer, so that chromated iron will become shiny. Chromium plating is done by electrolysis process. Chrome can provide protection even if the chrome layer is damaged. This method is generally done on motorized vehicles, such as car bumpers. Tin is a metal that is stainless. Iron cans are generally coated with tin. The coating process is carried out by electrolysis or electroplating.

Even if two objects with high similarity appeared together, they should be different. For example, if you rotate an equilateral triangle about its center by 120 degrees, the triangle will appear the same as before the rotation. In Euclidean Geometry, this rotation results in an unrecognized change. In fact, each corner of an equilateral triangle modeled as a molecule exhibits a different symmetrical behavior. The object with the most symmetry is empty space because each part can be rotated, reflected or translated without changing. The most common type of symmetry is left-right or mirror image symmetry which is symbolized by T:. this symbol is used to reflect along the vertical axis. An equilateral triangle exhibits three axes of reflection symmetry, and a rotational symmetry. Rotating the triangle about the center of the triangle by 120 or 240 degrees shows no change. An object that only exhibits rotational symmetry behavior but does not have reflection symmetry is the swastika. Examples of wikipedia symmetry (similarity obtained by shifting one line down and two spaces to the right), and translational symmetry of two forms: (similarity obtained by shifting three positions to the right, or one line down and two positions to the right; until similarity is obtained for three lines down). In both cases it is neither mirror-image nor rotational symmetry. Felix Klein, the German geometer, gave a very influential statement in the Erlangen program in 1872, symmetry as a combination and organization of principles in geometry. This gave rise to the group's new concern in geometry and the slogan transformation of geometry (an aspect of the new Mathematics, but highly controversial in modern mathematical practices).",

These smaller triangles can be rotated at the center line of the larger triangle and translated until they coincide. Smaller triangles can repeat the process, resulting in smaller triangles on sides. Structures into triangles can be created by repeating the scale of the symmetry operation several times. An example from mathematics that expresses symmetry is a2c + 3ab + b2c. If a and b are changed, the expression shows no change in the commutative property for addition and multiplication. In mathematics, a study of the symmetry of objects by collecting all operations that result in the object not changing. These operations form a group. For geometric objects, this is known as a symmetry group; for algebraic objects, the term automorphism group is used. In fact, at the end of the 20th century, group was synonymous with group transformation (con: group action). Only during the early 20th century were definitions of groups without reference to group action. A dyadic relationship R is symmetric if and if, while true for Wed, is true for Rba. The words age with are symmetry, for if Paul is the same age as Mary, then Mary is the same age as Paul. If we have a set of objects with multiple structures, then it is possible for a symmetry to convert one object to another. So it is necessary to generalize from the concept of a symmetric group to a groupoid. Physicists use generalizations such as supersymmetry and quantum groups. The generalization of symmetries in physics down to invariants under various transformations has become one of the tools of theoretical physics.

Chemists carefully measure the proportions of matter, reaction rates, and other chemical properties. The term 'chemist' is also used to refer to Pharmacists in the Commonwealth of Nations. Chemists use this knowledge to study the composition and properties of unconventional materials, as well as to manufacture and synthesize large quantities of natural materials and to develop new artificial materials and processes. Chemists may have specialized in a number of chemical subdisciplines. Materials scientists and metallurgists share a great deal of education and skills with chemists. The chemist's work is often associated with chemical engineering work, which is generally concerned with the design, construction and cost-effectiveness evaluation of large-scale chemical plants, and is closely linked with industrial chemists on the development of new processes and methods for the manufacture of chemicals and related products for commercial scale. . The roots of chemistry can be traced to the phenomenon of combustion. Fire in the past was a mystical power that could transform one material into another and thus became the main attraction of mankind. It was fire that sparked the discovery of iron and glass. After gold was discovered and became a precious metal, many people were interested in finding methods that could convert other materials into gold. This led to a protoscience called alchemy. The term chemist is derived from the Latin: chimista, short for alchimista (alchemist). Alchemists uncovered many of the chemical processes that led to the development of modern chemistry. Chemistry as it is known today, was created by Antoine Lavoisier with his law of conservation of mass in 1783.",

The Nobel Prize in Chemistry created in 1901 provides outstanding response to chemical discoveries since the early 20th century. Jobs for chemists usually require at least a bachelor's degree, but many positions, especially in research, require a doctorate. Most undergraduate programs emphasize mathematics and physics in addition to chemistry, because chemistry is also known as a \"science center\", so that chemists are required to have a thorough knowledge of science. At Masters level and above, students tend to experience specialization in a certain area. Fields of specialization include biochemistry, nuclear chemistry, organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry, polymer chemistry, analytical chemistry, theoretical chemistry, quantum chemistry, environmental chemistry, and thermochemistry. Postdoctoral experience may be required for certain positions. Workers who work involving chemistry, but with a complexity below that of a chemistry degree, are usually referred to as chemical technicians. Such technicians generally perform simpler tasks such as repeated analyzes for quality control or in a clinical laboratory. These chemical technicians in Indonesia are referred to as Associate Experts (D3). The top three companies that employ chemists are academic institutions, industry, especially the chemical and pharmaceutical industries, and government laboratories. Chemistry is usually divided into several main sub-disciplines. There are also several cross-disciplinary and more specialized fields. There is considerable overlap between the various branches of chemistry, as well as with other disciplines such as biology, medicine, physics, radiology, and some engineering disciplines. All of the above major fields of chemistry employ chemists. Other fields in which a chemistry degree can play a role include astrochemistry (and cosmos chemistry), atmospheric chemistry, chemical engineering, chemo-informatics, electrochemistry, environmental science, forensic science, geochemistry, green chemistry, history of chemistry, materials science, medical science, molecular biology , molecular genetics, nanotechnology, nuclear chemistry, oenology, organometallic chemistry, petrochemistry, pharmacology, photochemistry, phytochemistry, polymer chemistry, supramolecular chemistry and surface chemistry.",

Some estimates include: Through foreign trade, the island gave up its name to the Classical Latin word for copper via the aes Cyprium phase, \"Cyprus metal\", later shortened to Cuprum. The standard demonym associated with Cyprus or the people or culture is Cypriot. The terms Cypriote and Cyprian are also used, although less frequently. Cyprus, while still a British colony, would be given to Greece. But the Turkish minority refused. Eventually a compromise was agreed and in 1959 the independent state of Cyprus was established. But both sides were not satisfied and finally in 1974 a group that wanted unity with Greece staged a coup d'etat which Turkey reciprocated by occupying Cyprus. Since then Turkey occupied the northern region. On May 1, 2004, which coincided with the commemoration of Labor Day, Cyprus became a member of the European Union.

There are also calendars that appear to be timed to the movement of Venus, such as some of the Ancient Egyptian Calendars. This calendar also seems to have been used frequently in civilizations near the equator. The calendar that uses the seasons and the Earth's revolution around the sun is called the Solar Calendar. The Solar calendar was used by the Romans and their calculation system was used in the Julian calendar. There are 7 days used by the Solar Calendar, namely Sunday/Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. Since the reign of a Roman emperor named Julius Caesar, on the advice of an astronomer named Sosigenes of Alexandria, Julius Caesar changed the number of days in each existing month to include leap year calculations.

It reviews various matters concerning soil formation (pedogenesis), soil morphology (physical and chemical properties and characteristics), and soil classification. The term is borrowed from the English pedology, which is formed from two Greek words: pedon (\"soil\") and logos (\"symbol\", \"knowledge\"). Pedology is one of the two main branches of soil science, besides edaphology (the science of soil fertility). Soil classification has various versions. There are technical difficulties in classifying soils because many factors influence soil formation. In addition, soil is a dynamic object, so it is always undergoing a process of change. Soil is formed from worn/weathered rock due to exposure to dynamics in the lower layers of the atmosphere, such as climate dynamics, topography/geography, and the activity of biological organisms. The intensity and time intervals of these factors also result in variations in the appearance of the soil. In classifying soil, experts first do it based on physical and chemical characteristics, as well as by looking at the layers that make up the soil profile. Furthermore, after the technology has developed far, the experts also look at aspects of the bedrock that forms the soil and the weathering process of the rocks which then gives certain characteristics to the soil that is formed. Based on these criteria, there are many types of soil in the world. To make it easier, experts often classify locally. For Indonesia, for example, the Dudal-Soepraptohardjo (1957-1961) classification system is known, which is still referred to today in Indonesia for agricultural purposes, especially in a modified version by the Center for Soil and Agro-climate Research (Puslittanak) in 1978 and 1982.

The weakness of this system, especially for developing countries, is that the criteria are based on detailed laboratory analysis, making it difficult for practitioners to define directly in the field. However, the USDA system is helpful because it uses a consistent naming system. For communication among world soil experts, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has also developed a soil classification system since 1974. In 1998 it was agreed to use the WRB classification system from the World Reference Base for Soil Resources, a project formed by FAO, to replace the system this. The latest version of the WRB system was released in 2007. Soil taxonomy based on the Dudal-Soepraptohardjo system is based on the appearance of the soil profile and a number of physical and chemical characteristics. The basis of this system is that of Rudi Dudal, a soil expert from Belgium, who was modified for the Indonesian situation by M. Soepraptohardjo. This system is preferred by agricultural field workers because it is easy to implement in the field. The original version was released in 1957. Modifications were made by the Center for Soil Research in 1978 and 1982.

The oldest part of the city became a settlement in the 4th millennium BC. In 1538 a wall was built around Jerusalem during the reign of Suleiman Al-Qanuni. Today these walls surround the Old City, which is traditionally divided into four quarters\u2014known since the early 19th century as the Armenian, Christian, Jewish, and Muslim Quarters. The Old Town became a World Heritage Site in 1981, and is included on the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger. Modern Jerusalem has expanded far beyond the boundaries of the Old City. According to biblical tradition, King David captured this city from the Jebus tribe and later founded it as the capital of the United Kingdom of Israel; his son, King Solomon, ordered the construction of the First Temple. These key events, from the beginning of the 1st millennium BC, have played a central role symbolically for the Jewish people. The nickname holy city (\u05e2\u05d9\u05e8 \u05d4\u05e7\u05d5\u05d3\u05e9, transliterated 'ir haqodesh) may have been attributed to Jerusalem in the post-exilic period. The sacredness of Jerusalem in Christianity, preserved in the Septuagint which the Christians adopted as their own authority, is confirmed by the New Testament account of Jesus' crucifixion there. In the view of Sunni Islam, Jerusalem is the third holiest city after Mecca and Medina. In Islamic tradition, in 610 AD Jerusalem became the first Qibla, i.e. the direction one should turn to in prayer, and Muhammad made his Night Journey there 10 years later, ascending to heaven where he spoke to Allah, according to the Quran.",

Currently, the status of Jerusalem remains one of the main issues in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. During the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, West Jerusalem was among the areas captured and later annexed by Israel; while East Jerusalem, including the Old City, was captured and later annexed by Jordan. Israel captured East Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 Six-Day War and thereafter annexed it to Jerusalem, along with additional territories surrounding it. viii] One of Israel's Basic Laws, namely the 1980 Jerusalem Law, designates Jerusalem as the undivided capital of that country. All areas of Israeli government are in Jerusalem, including the Knesset (Israel's parliament), the residence of the Prime Minister and President, as well as the Supreme Court. Although the international community rejects the annexation as illegal and treats East Jerusalem as occupied Palestinian territory, Israel has a stronger claim to sovereignty over West Jerusalem. The international community does not recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, and no foreign embassies have been established in the city. There are also several non-governmental Israeli institutions of national interest in Jerusalem, such as the Hebrew University and the Israel Museum with the Shrine of the Book on its grounds.

The word pastor itself comes from the Latin word pastor which means shepherd. The use of the word \"pastor\" comes from the Bible. In the Hebrew Bible and Old Testament, the Hebrew word \u05e8\u05e2\u05d4 (ra'ah) is used for \"shepherd\". This word is used 173 times to describe the act of feeding the sheep as in the Book of Genesis 29:7 and also in relation to humans as in Jeremiah 3:15, \"I will appoint for you shepherds according to My heart; they will shepherd you with knowledge and understanding.\" In the New Testament, the Greek word \u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03bc\u03b7\u03bd (poim\u0113n) is used and is usually translated as shepherd. This word is used 18 times in the New Testament. For example, Letter to Ephesians 4:11, \"And it is he who gives both apostles and prophets, both evangelists and shepherds and teachers\" (LAI). Jesus also referred to himself as the \"Good Shepherd\" in John 10:11. New Testament writers seem to use the words pastor or pastor as synonyms for the church offices of elder (presbuteros) or overseer or bishop (episkopos). For example, in Acts 20:17, the Apostle Paul urged the elders of the church in Ephesus to deliver a final message to them. In the process, in Acts 20:28, he told them that the Holy Spirit had made them overseers, and that their job was to shepherd their church. Peter uses the same language in 1 Peter 5:1-2, and tells the elders among his readers that they too must \"feed\" the flock entrusted to them, and act as \"owners of the church.\"",

In Titus 1:5-9, a very similar list is given, this time for elders, who are also referred to in 1:7 as overseers of the church. According to many scholars, the practice of separating the offices of pastor and bishop occurred at least in the 2nd century AD. At this time, a bishop or overseer (as opposed to a group of overseers or presbyters, which the churches of the first century had) began overseeing groups of Christians throughout the city, even though they met in different places. In the 3rd and 4th centuries, the bishops of some of the most important cities began to have power over the entire ecclesiastical area with parish and diocesan groupings, or eparchy, of many of today's Christian groups. According to the rules of the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Church, especially the Orthodox Church, after being ordained, priests do not marry for the rest of their lives. The intention is to follow the traditions of the Church from the past, to focus more on serving God and the people, and when you are ordained as a priest, you are already committed to God (in other words, you have become God's bride). In Protestant churches, a Pastor is allowed to marry. Around AD 400, Augustine, the famous bishop of North Africa, described the duties of a pastor: Bullies must be rebuked, those who lack zeal must be encouraged, the weak must be supported, opposers refuted, the untrustworthy must be watched out for, the untrusted the gifted are taught, the lazy are encouraged, the contentious are controlled, the proud are suppressed, the demanding is appeased, the poor are helped, the oppressed are set free, the good are praised, the bad are endured, and all are to be loved.",

Several aspects of ornithology differ from those closely related to the discipline, which relate to the heightened ability of vision and the aesthetic approach of birds. Most decisions among those being field level learning are done by amateur volunteers working within the parameters of scientific methodology. Ornithology has a long history and the study of birds has helped develop several key concepts in evolution, behavior and ecology such as species definition, speciation processes, instincts, learning, ecology, unions, island biogeography, phylogeography and conservation. Ornithology's Contribution to While early ornithology was principally concerned with the description and distribution of species, today's ornithologists seek answers to very specific questions, often using birds as models to test hypotheses or theory-based predictions. Most modern biological theories apply across taxonomic groups and the number of professional scientists who identify themselves as \"ornithologists\" has therefore declined. A variety of tools and techniques are used in ornithology, both in the laboratory and out in the field, and innovations continue to be made. The history of ornithology largely reflects trends in the history of biology. Trends include moving from mere description to identification of patterns and then towards elucidating the processes that generate patterns. Humans must have observed birds from the earliest times and rock age drawings are one of the oldest indications of interest in birds. The bird was probably important as a food source, and the bones of as many as 80 species have been found in excavations of early Stone Age settlements. Cultures around the world have a rich vocabulary related to birds. Traditional bird names are often based on detailed knowledge of behavior, with many names being onomatopoeic, still widely used. Traditional knowledge may also involve the use of birds in folk medicine and knowledge of these practices is passed on through oral tradition Hunting for wild birds and their domestication will require a good knowledge of their habits.",

The formation of wind direction occurs due to differences in air pressure in two different places. Air flows from places with high air pressure to places with low air pressure. The occurrence of wind is influenced by the earth's rotation along with the process of heating an area by the sun. Winds are named based on where they come from, such as land breezes, valley breezes, and mountain breezes. The power of the wind is utilized in various activities in human life. Residents who live on the coast take advantage of the wind when going to sea by sailing ship. The wind is also useful for flying toy kites. Dutch citizens use wind to become a source of energy for wind power plants. The process of the occurrence of wind can not be separated from the relationship between air pressure and temperature. When heated, air expands. The expanding air becomes lighter and the air pressure decreases as the air density decreases. The cold air then flows into the low pressure area. The flow of hot air up and cold air down is called convection. Wind speed is expressed in knots. While the cardinal directions are divided into eight directions namely north, south, west, east, southeast, northwest, northeast and southwest. Factors for the occurrence of wind, namely: Sea breeze (English: sea breeze) is a wind that blows from the sea towards the land which generally occurs during the day approximately from 09.00 to 16.00 in coastal areas.

The air pressure over land is lower because it is warmer, while the air pressure over the ocean tends to be higher because it is colder. As a result, there is a pressure gradient from higher oceans to lower land, causing sea breezes, where the strength is proportional to the temperature difference between land and sea. However, if there are offshore winds that are stronger than 8 km/hour, then sea breezes do not occur. Land breeze (English: land breeze) is a wind that blows from the land towards the sea which generally occurs at night from 20.00 to 06.00 in coastal areas. This type of wind is beneficial for fishermen to go fishing with a simple wind-powered boat. At night the land cools faster than the ocean, because the heat capacity of land is lower than that of water. As a result, the temperature difference that causes the sea breeze gradually disappears and vice versa, the opposite pressure difference appears because the air pressure over the hotter ocean becomes lower than the land, so land breezes occur, especially when the coastal winds are not strong enough to fight them. Mountain winds are winds that blow from mountain peaks to mountain valleys and occur at night. Valley breeze is a wind that blows from the valley towards the top of the mountain and occurs during the day.

Its complex structure affords a wider range of expression possibilities and uses than any known animal communication system. Since the time of hominins, language is thought to have begun to gradually change the system of communication between primates. Primates then begin to acquire the ability to form a theory of mind and intentionality.

At standard temperature and pressure, ethane is a colorless and odorless gas. In the industry ethane is produced by means of isolation from natural gas, and as a by-product of oil refining. Its main use is as a feedstock for the production of ethylene. Related compounds can be formed by replacing hydrogen atoms with other functional groups; The ethane moiety is called an ethyl group. For example, an ethyl group bonded to a hydroxyl group gives ethanol, the alcohol in beverages. Ethane was first synthesized in 1834 by Michael Faraday, via the electrolysis of a solution of potassium acetate. He thought the hydrocarbon product of this reaction was methane and did not investigate further. During the period 1847-1849, in an attempt to prove the radical theory of organic chemistry, Hermann Kolbe and Edward Frankland produced ethane by the reduction of propionitrile (ethyl cyanide) and ethyl iodide with potassium metal, and, as did Faraday, by electrolysis of aqueous solutions of acetate. However, they assumed that the product of this reaction was a methyl radical, whereas what was produced was a dimer of methyl, namely ethane. This error was corrected by Carl Schorlemmer in 1864, who showed that the product of all these reactions was actually ethane. The name ethane comes from the IUPAC nomenclature for organic chemistry. \"Eth-\" comes from the German for drinkable alcohol (ethanol), and \"-ana\" refers to the presence of single bonds between carbon atoms.

Cooling this ethane below approximately 899 K (626 \u00b0C; 1,159 \u00b0F) converts it to ethane II, which is monoclinic and metastable. Ethane is only very slightly soluble in water. Ethane can be viewed as two methyl groups joined together, namely a dimer of a methyl group. Ethane can be easily synthesized in the laboratory by Kolbe electrolysis. In this technique, electrolysis of aqueous acetate salt solutions is carried out. At the anode, acetate is oxidized to give carbon dioxide and a methyl radical, and the highly reactive methyl radical combines to give ethane: Another method that is conceptually similar is the oxidation of acetic anhydride with peroxide. The chemistry of ethane primarily involves free radical reactions. Ethane can react with halogens, especially chlorine and bromine, via free radical halogenation. This reaction proceeds via ethyl radical propagation: Since halogenated ethane can undergo further free radical halogenation, this process produces a mixture of several halogenated products. In the chemical industry, more selective chemical reactions are used to produce certain haloalkanes with two carbon atoms. The complete combustion process of ethane releases 1559.7 kJ/mol, or 51.9 kJ/g of heat, and produces carbon dioxide and water according to the chemical equation. Combustion can also occur without excess oxygen, forming a mixture of amorphous carbon and carbon monoxide. Combustion occurs via a complex series of free radical reactions.

The first category of acids is the proton donor or Br\u00f8nsted acid. In the special case of an aqueous solution, the proton donor forms the hydronium ion H3O+ and is known as an Arrhenius acid. Br\u00f8nsted and Lowry generalized the Arrhenius theory to include non-aqueous solvents. Both Br\u00f8nsted and Arrhenius acids usually have hydrogen atoms attached to a chemical structure that remain energetically active after losing H+. Arrhenius acid in aqueous solution has characteristic properties that provide a practical description of acids. Acids form aqueous solutions with a sour taste, can turn blue litmus red, and react with bases and various metals (such as calcium) to form salts. The word acid (English from acid) comes from the Latin acidus/ac\u0113re which means sour.

One of them is boron trifluoride (BF3) where the boron atom has an empty orbital that can form covalent bonds by sharing lone pairs of electrons on atoms in basic compounds, for example the nitrogen atom in ammonia (NH3). Lewis considers this theory as a generalization of the Br\u00f8nsted definition so that an acid is a chemical species that accepts an electron pair either directly or by releasing a proton (H+) into solution, which then accepts the electron pair. However, hydrogen chloride, acetic acid, and most other Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry acids cannot form covalent bonds with electron pairs and are therefore not Lewis acids. In contrast, many Lewis acids are neither Arrhenius nor Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry acids.

A Muslim is required to purify himself every time he prays. Wudu can also use dust called tayammum. The history of ablution is found in the Al-Qur'an in Surah Al-Ma'idah verse 6 which is the same as the order of obligatory prayer, which is six months before the Prophet Muhammad migrated to Medina. The requirements for performing ablution are five and six obligatory laws. In addition, there are eight things that invalidate ablution. Before performing salat, every Muslim must perform ablution. The trick is to clean certain parts of the body using water. Wudu is a mandatory condition before performing obligatory and sunnah prayers. The conditions for performing ablution are being Muslim, being of sound mind, using holy water, and not having any obstacles. The meaning of common sense is being able to distinguish between good things and bad things. Meanwhile, holy water is water that has never been used for other purposes, such as rainwater, seawater, river water, melting snow, and water from tanks or large ponds. Obstacle in ablution is najis or hadas. This barrier is divided into two, namely birth barrier and biological barrier. Birth barriers such as dirt stuck between the nails, while biological barriers such as menstruation and postpartum for women. Additional conditions are given to people with diseases that make them always have to stop. For those suffering from diseases that always have hadas, ablution is performed every time entering prayer. This bad disease is, for example, whiteness and not being able to hold back urination. Wudu begins with the intention of reading the Basmalah followed by washing both palms. Then gargle to wash the nose and the face, the palms of the hands up to the elbows, wipe the head and ears and finish by washing the soles of the feet up to the heels.",

        "paragraph": "The ablution is carried out sequentially and the right side is prioritized once each, but if it feels incomplete it can be repeated up to a limit of 3 times. Wudu can be canceled due to several reasons. The most common cause is discharge from the anus or genitals. The next cause is sleeping with the body position on the stomach or legs raised. Wudu can also be canceled if the person performing the ablution loses his mind due to drunkenness, illness, epilepsy or madness. The cancellation of ablution is also caused by direct skin-to-skin contact with a person who is not a mahram. The presence or absence of lust does not affect the cancellation of wudu. The last condition that can invalidate wudu is touching the anus of oneself or another person, whether alive or dead. According to ijmaa, urine and excrement that come out of the genitals and anus invalidate wudu. Anything other than those two when it comes out of the genitals and anus also invalidates ablution. Only the Maliki School holds that the discharge of anything other than urine and excrement from the genitals and anus does not invalidate ablution. The Hanafi School, the Hambali School and the Maliki School are of the opinion that the discharge of semen invalidates ablution. Meanwhile, the Shafi'i school of thought is of the opinion that the release of semen does not invalidate ablution, but requires wandi to be obligatory. Meanwhile, the Hanafi School believes that urine, excrement and semen invalidate ablution. The priests of the madhhab agree that wudu is not invalidated when someone touches his own private parts, not with his hands. However, they differed on the cancellation of ablution due to touching the genitals with their hands. The Hanafi school of thought is of the opinion that it invalidates wudu by using any part of the hand. The Shafi'i school is of the opinion that wudu is invalidated if it touches the genitals without obstruction using the inside of the hand.",

Words that refer to the same concepts and processes include cognition, understanding, consciousness, ideas and imagination. Thinking involves the brain's manipulation of information, as when we form concepts, engage in problem solving, reasoning, and making decisions. Thinking is a high-level cognitive function and the analysis of thought processes forms part of cognitive psychology. The term mind according to the Big Indonesian Dictionary comes from the word \"thought\" which means reason, or memory. Meanwhile, the mind is the result of thinking (thinking). The use of \"thought\" or \"thinking\" can be associated with a wide variety of psychological activities. Understanding in general, thinking is the process of using reason to consider something. It includes a variety of different mental processes, such as considering an idea or proposition or judging it to be true. In this sense, memory and imagination are forms of thought but perception is not. In a more limited sense, only the most paradigmatic cases are considered as thoughts. It involves conscious processes that are conceptual or linguistic and quite abstract, such as judging, inferring, problem solving, and reasoning. Sometimes the terms \"thinking\" and \"thought\" are understood in a very broad sense as referring to any form of mental process, conscious or unconscious. Mind is a word that comes from the Old English \"\u00feoht, or ge\u00feoht, from the root \u00feencan\" to imagine in the mind, consider\". The basic mechanism of human brain cells reflects the process of pattern matching or pattern recognition. new experiences are judged on the basis of what is remembered.To make these judgments, the mind retains current experiences and ranks relevant past experiences.",

The mind can mix, match, combine, exchange, and order concepts, perceptions, and experiences. This process is called reasoning. Logic is the science of reasoning. Awareness of this reasoning process is entry into consciousness (see philosopher Ned Block). The mind can be classified into two parts that are useful as information filters, namely the conscious mind and the subconscious mind. Conscious mind is a tendency to think logically consciously related to reasoning and logic used in everyday life, such as thinking when doing something, thinking about eating when hungry, and so on. Mind consciously as mastery of one's mind is as much as 12%. The subconscious mind is a tendency to think related to emotions and their stored places which subjectively respond to what is conveyed, such as memories, habits, personality, beliefs, and so on. The subconscious mind as the controller of the human body is as much as 88%. Humans as individuals or social beings cannot be separated from the context of their awareness in thinking. Human awareness makes a person able to determine his choice, not just a relationship anymore. In making a choice, patterns of thinking will emerge so that they become the basis for belief in the right, efficient and effective choice. This is what is called the pattern of human thinking. Discussion is one way to exchange ideas related to a problem. The process of thinking in discussions will result in gathering information to solve problems both formally and informally collected from concept ideas, problem solving, to comments. By discussing too, a person is able to convey his arguments or opinions which cannot be separated from thought processes and language. Thought and language are interrelated in solving problems in the discussion process.",

Therefore, industry is generally known as the next link in the chain of efforts to fulfill (economic) needs related to the earth, namely after agriculture, plantations and mining which are closely related to the land. The position of the industry is increasingly far from the land, which is the basis of the economy, culture and politics. Industry is part of the production process and production process activities in the industry are called industry. Industry can also be interpreted as a collection of various companies that offer the same product. In other words, each product is a substitute for one another because the firm uses the same inputs and faces more or less the same group of suppliers and buyers. The industrial sector is divided into two, namely the goods industry and the service industry. The goods industry is a business of processing raw materials into semi-finished goods or finished goods. This industrial activity produces various types of goods, such as clothing, shoes, cars, motorbikes, fertilizers, and medicines. Meanwhile, the service industry is an economic activity by providing services. For example: transportation services such as buses, trains, flights, and shipping. There are also service companies that help with the production process. For example, banking and warehousing services. There are services that are directly addressed to consumers. Examples include insurance, health, tailors, lawyers, beauty salons and barbers. The industry started with the work of a carpenter or interpreter.

In order to become good craftsmen and carpenters, apprentice education patterns were held, and to maintain the quality of handicrafts and carpentry in Europe various guilds were formed (associations of craftsmen and craftsmen as the forerunner of various associations now). Iron and steel mining progressed rapidly in the Middle Ages. Furthermore, the mining of fuels such as coal, oil and gas also developed rapidly. Both of these spurred advances in mechanical technology, starting with the invention of the steam engine which in turn paved the way for the manufacture and trade of goods on a large scale and mass in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. At first, textile factories emerged (Lille, and Manchester) and railroads, then the steel industry (Essen) and shipyards, car factories (Detroit), aluminum factories. From the need for dyeing in textile factories, the chemical and pharmaceutical industries have developed. There was the Industrial Revolution. Since then a wave of industrialization in the form of the establishment of factories for the mass production of goods, the use of labor force, has rapidly swept across the world, colliding with traditional efforts in agriculture (agriculture). Since then, a variety of industry classifications have emerged. Most people assume that industry is just a human economic activity that processes raw materials/raw materials into semi-finished or finished goods.

        "paragraph": "Metallurgy is a field of materials science and engineering that studies the physical and chemical behavior of metal elements, inter-metallic compounds, and metal alloys called alloys or lacures. Metallurgy is also metal technology, namely the application of science to the production of metals and the engineering of metal components for use in products intended for consumers and manufacturing industries. Metals production includes processing ores to extract their metal contents, and alloying metals, sometimes with non-metallic elements, to produce alloys. Metallurgy differs from craft metalworking, although technical progress in metalworking depends on developments in metallurgical science, just as technical progress in the practice of medicine depends on developments in medical science. Metallurgy is divided into iron-steel metallurgy (black metal science) and non-ferrous-steel metallurgy (multicolored metal science). Iron-steel metallurgy includes methods of processing ferrous elements and making alloys based on iron, while non-ferrous-steel metallurgy includes methods of processing and making alloys based on metals other than iron. Iron-steel production accounts for 95 percent of world metal production. The term \"metallurgy\" comes from the Ancient Greek word: \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b3\u03cc\u03c2, metallourg\u00f3s, \"metalworker\", a combination of \u03bc\u03ad\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd, m\u00e9tallon, \"metal\", and \u1f14\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf\u03bd, \u00e9rgon, \"work\". Originally the word \"metallurgy\" was a term used in alchemy to refer to the activity of extracting metals from minerals, the suffix -urgy denoting a process, especially a manufacturing process: this metallurgical meaning was discussed in the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica 1797. At the end of the 19th century, The scope of meaning of metallurgy extends to include the more general scientific study of metals, alloys and processes related to them.

Small amounts of gold have been found to have been used in caves in Spain during the Paleolithic period, around 40,000 BC Meteoric silver, copper, lead and iron can also be found free, and allowed limited amounts of metalworking. Egyptian weapons made from meteoric iron around 3000 BC were highly valued as \"daggers from the sky\". With the knowledge of obtaining copper and tin by heating rocks, and of combining copper and tin to obtain an alloy known as bronze, metallurgical technology began around 3500 BC during the Bronze Age. The extraction of iron from its ores into a workable metal is much more difficult. This process appears to have been created by the Hittites in around 1200 BC, at the start of the Iron Age. The secret of iron extraction and processing was a key factor in the success of the Philistines. Historical developments in ferrous metallurgy can be found in various past cultures and civilizations. It includes the ancient and medieval kingdoms and empires of the Middle and Near East, ancient Egypt and Anatolia (present-day Turkey), Carthage, Greece, ancient Rome, medieval Europe, ancient and medieval China, ancient and medieval India, ancient Japan and middle, and so on. Many metallurgical applications, practices and tools may have been in use in ancient China before Europeans mastered them (such as furnaces, cast iron, steel, etc.). Based on the closeness between metallurgy and mining, initially metallurgical education was born from mining schools such as metallurgical education at the Colorado School of Mines. Extraction metallurgy is the practice of extracting a valuable metal from an ore and refining the extracted raw metal into a pure form.",

        "paragraph": "Einsteinium is a chemical element with the symbol Es and atomic number 99. Einsteinium is a member of the actinide series and is the seventh transuranium element. This element was named in honor of Albert Einstein. Einsteinium was discovered as a component of the debris of the first hydrogen bomb explosion in 1952. Its most common isotope, einsteinium-253 (half-life 20.47 days), is produced artificially from the decay of californium-253 in several high-power nuclear reactors with a total yield of on the order of one milligram per year. The synthesis reactor is followed by a complex process of separating einsteinium-253 from other actinides and their decay products. Other isotopes are synthesized in various laboratories, but in much smaller quantities, by bombarding heavy actinide elements with light ions. Because einsteinium is produced only in small quantities and the short half-life of its most easily produced isotope, there are currently almost no practical applications for the element outside of basic scientific research. Specifically, einsteinium was used to synthesize, for the first time, 17 atoms of the new element delevium in 1955. Einsteinium is a soft, silvery paramagnetic metal. Its chemistry is typical of the late actinides, with the higher +3 oxidation number; the oxidation number +2 is also accessible, especially in solids. Einsteinium-253's high radioactivity produces visible light and rapidly degrades its crystalline metal lattice, with heat released of about 1000 watts per gram. The difficulty in studying its properties is that einsteinium-253 decays into berkelium-249 and then californium-249 at a rate of about 3% per day. The einsteinium isotope with the longest half-life, einsteinium-252 (half-life 471.7 days) would be more suitable for investigations of physical properties, but has proven much more difficult to produce and is only available in small quantities, rather than large amounts.",

Like all synthetic transuranium elements, the isotope einsteinium is highly radioactive and is considered very hazardous to health if ingested. Einsteinium was first identified in December 1952 by Albert Ghiorso and colleagues at the University of California, Berkeley in collaboration with Argonne and Los Alamos National Laboratories, as a result of the Ivy Mike nuclear test. This test took place on November 1, 1952, at Enewetak Atoll in the Pacific Ocean and was the first successful test of a thermonuclear weapon. Preliminary examination of the debris from the explosion has shown the production of a new plutonium isotope, 24494Pu, which can only be formed by the absorption of six neutrons by a uranium-238 nucleus followed by two beta decays. At the time, double neutron absorption was thought to be an extremely rare process, but the identification of 24494Pu shows that many more neutrons can be captured by uranium nuclei, resulting in new elements that are heavier than californium. Ghiorso and co-workers analyzed filter paper that had been flown through blast clouds in airplanes (the same sampling technique that had been used to find 24494Pu). Large amounts of radioactive material were later isolated from the atoll's coral debris, which was then shipped to the U.S. Separation of suspected new elements was carried out in the presence of citric acid/ammonium buffer solution in a weak acid medium (pH \u2248 3.5), using ion exchange at high temperature; less than 200 einsteinium atoms were found in the end.

        "paragraph": "Electrostatics is a branch of physics that deals with the force exerted by a static (non-changing/moving) electric field on other charged objects. The history of electricity begins with observing amber or resin material which in Greek means electron, which when the material is rubbed with the skin of a hairy animal can attract light, smooth objects which after sticking to it then repel it. or that was affixed to it, for which reason the object was said to be charged with \"awesomeness\" or resinious. The same thing happened to glass rubbed with silk, the infection of which made other objects affixed to it charged with \"glassyness\" or vitrious. 1733, Francois du Fay discovered the fact that in nature there are only two types of charges, namely resinous and vitrious charges, and two objects with the same charge will repel and vice versa two objects will attract if the charges are different. Then Benjamin Franklin (1706) \u20131790) discovered the fact that the two types of charge are resinious and vitrious when combined they cancel each other out as with positive and negative numbers. Since then resinious charge has been called a negative electric charge and vitrious has been called a positive electric charge. Continuing Michelson and Carlisle's experiments on electrolysis, Michael Faraday (1791\u20131867) in 1883 proposed the quantization of electric charge into charge units, which was later by Stoney in 1874, which was reinforced by J.J. Thomson in 1897, hypothesized the existence of electric charge-carrying particles which were then called electrons. As a resin, electrons are said to produce a negative electric charge, so the electrons will also be negatively charged. Even though J.C. Maxwell (1831-1879) managed to combine all electrical laws and formulas in the form of four equations which later became known as Maxwell's equations so that all electrical phenomena can always be explained based on or translated from the four equations, in essence the four equations can be combined to become or can be translated from Coulomb's law:\u2033F\u2033=kq1.q2r2{\\displaystyle ''F''=k{\\dfrac {q1.q2}{r^{2}}}}which states that the force between two electric charges q1 and q2 will proportional to the amount of each electric charge and inversely proportional to the square of the distance (r) between the two electric charges, and depending on the medium in which the two charges are located, which in its formulation is determined by a medium constant k. So Coulomb's law is a fundamental law in electricity, which underlies all electrical laws and formulas, just as the law of 'Newton's initials' in mechanics underlies all mechanical laws and formulas. In the m.k.s unit system, the medium constant k is written as 1/(4 \u03c0 \u03b5 ), so Coulomb's law becomes:\u2033F\u2033=q1.q24\u03c0\u03f5r2{\\displaystyle ''F''={\\dfrac {q1.q2}{4\\pi \\epsilon r^{2}}}}and \u03b5 is called permittivity of the medium.

The electric field is said to be strong if the force on the electric charge in the room with the electric field is large. But the coulomb force is large against many electric charges so that the electric field strength is defined as the force on one unit electric charge. So from Coulomb's law above, the electric field strength by a point electric charge q is: E=q4\u03c0\u03f5r2r^{\\displaystyle E={\\dfrac {q}{4\\pi \\epsilon r^{2}}}{\\hat {r }}} where r is the unit vector of the radial direction from the point charge q .

The direction of the local electric field, that is, in the direction of the force lines at that place, of course alludes to the lines of force at that place. In essence, every point must be passed by a line of force, so that the lines of force will fill the entire room. But if we draw all the force lines, then the line pattern system of the force will not be visible.

        "paragraph": "Viruses are pathogenic microorganisms that can only replicate within cells because they do not have the cellular equipment to reproduce on their own. All forms of life can be infected by viruses, from animals and plants to bacteria and archaea. The term virus is usually used to describe a type of virus that infects eukaryotic cells, while viruses that infect prokaryotic cells (such as bacteria and archaea) are known as bacteriophages. The existence of viruses was first recognized through the scientific writings of Dmitri Ivanovsky in 1892 who described non-bacterial pathogens that infect tobacco plants and the discovery of tobacco mosaic virus by Martinus Beijerinck in 1898. Until 2019, more than 6,000 virus species have been described in detail, of the total millions of types of viruses in the environment. Viruses are found in almost every ecosystem on Earth and are the most numerous biological entities. The study of viruses is known as virology, a subspecialty of microbiology. When infected, the host cell is forced to rapidly produce thousands of identical copies of the original virus. When not inside the cell or in the process of infecting the cell, the virus exists as an independent particle called a virion. A virion consists of two or three parts: (1) genetic material, which is a long molecule of nucleic acid (only DNA or RNA, but not a combination of both) that encodes the protein structure used by the virus; (2) a protein coat called a capsid, which functions to surround and protect the genetic material; and in some viruses there is (3) an outer sheath or envelope made of lipids. The shape of virus particles ranges from simple helical, icosahedral (20-sided shape) to more complex structures. Most virus species have virions that are too small to be seen with a light microscope because they are one-hundredth the size of an ordinary bacterium.",

        "paragraph": "The origins of viruses in the evolutionary history of life are still unclear: some viruses may have evolved from plasmids (pieces of DNA that can move between cells), while others may have evolved from bacteria. In evolution, viruses are important intermediates in horizontal gene transfer, which increases genetic diversity in a manner analogous to sexual reproduction. There is scientific disagreement regarding the status of viruses as living things or as organic structures that interact with living things. As life forms, viruses carry genetic material, reproduce, and evolve through natural selection, although they lack key characteristics of living things, such as cell structure, that are generally considered necessary criteria for life. Because they share some of the criteria of being alive but not all of them, viruses are described as \"organisms on the edge of life\", and as self-repliers. Viruses spread in many ways. One route of transmission is through disease-carrying organisms known as vectors: for example, viruses are often transmitted from plant to plant by insects that feed on plant sap, such as aphids; and viruses in animals can be carried by blood-sucking insects. The influenza virus is spread by coughing and sneezing. Norovirus and Rotavirus, common causes of viral gastroenteritis, are transmitted by the faecal\u2013oral route, through hand-to-mouth contact or ingestion of food or water. The infectious dose of Norovirus required to produce infection in humans is less than 100 particles. HIV is one of several viruses that are transmitted through sexual intercourse and exposure to blood containing the virus. The variety of host cells that a virus can infect is called the \"host range\". This range can be narrow, meaning the virus is only capable of infecting a few species, or broad, meaning it is capable of infecting many species.",

The scale gets its name from the astronomer Anders Celsius (1701\u20131744), who first proposed it in 1742. Because there are one hundred steps between these two reference points, the original term for the system was centigrade (100 parts) or centesimal. In 1948 the name of this system was officially changed to Celsius by the 9th General Conference on Weights and Measures (CR 64), as a tribute to Celsius and to prevent confusion arising from conflicts over the use of the prefix centi- (in Indonesian centi-) as used SI unit of measure. Although the figures for the freezing and boiling times for water remain fairly precise, the original definition is not suitable for use as a formal standard: it relies on the standard definition of atmospheric pressure which itself depends on the definition of temperature. The current official definition of Celsius states that 0.01\u00b0C is at the triple point of water and one degree is 1/273.16 of the temperature difference between the triple point of water and absolute zero. This definition ensures that one degree Celsius represents a temperature difference equal to one kelvin. Anders Celsius originally proposed the freezing point to be at 100 degrees and the boiling point at 0 degrees. This was reversed in 1747, at the instigation of Linnaeus, or possibly Daniel Ekstr\u00f6m, maker of most of the thermometers used by Celsius. A temperature of \u221240 degrees has the same value for Celsius and Fahrenheit. Also, a way to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit is to add 40, multiply by the temperature ratio and then subtract 40.

Erosion is not the same as weathering due to weather, which is the process of destroying rock minerals by chemical or physical processes, or a combination of both. In general, erosion involves three processes, namely detachment, transformation, and sedimentation. The erosion that occurs can form many interesting natural features such as mountain peaks, valleys and coastlines. Erosion is actually a natural process that is easy to recognize, but in most places it is exacerbated by human activities in poor land use, deforestation, mining, plantation and cultivation activities, construction or development activities that are not well managed and road construction. Soil used to produce agricultural crops is usually subject to much greater erosion than soil with natural vegetation. The conversion of forests into agricultural fields increases erosion, because the strong root structures of forest plants that bind the soil are replaced with weaker root structures of agricultural crops. The impact of erosion is the depletion of the top layer of soil, which will reduce land capability (land degradation). Another consequence of erosion is the decreased ability of the soil to absorb water (infiltration). A decrease in the ability of land to absorb water into the soil layer will increase surface water runoff which will result in flooding in rivers. In addition, soil particles that are transported by surface runoff will eventually settle in rivers (sedimentation), which in turn, due to high sedimentation, will cause siltation of rivers, which will affect the smoothness of shipping lanes.",

Excessive erosion, of course, can cause problems, for example in terms of sedimentation, ecosystem damage and simultaneous loss of water. The amount of erosion depends on various influencing factors including climate, vegetation, soil characteristics, land use, and topography. Climatic factors, including amount and intensity of rain/precipitation, average and range of temperatures, as well as seasonality, wind speed, frequency of storms. Geological factors including sediment type, rock type, porosity and permeability, land slope. Biological factors include the vegetation cover of the land, the creatures that live in the land and land use by humans. In general, with the same ecosystem and vegetation, areas with high rainfall, high frequency of rain, more frequent exposure to wind or storms are more likely to be eroded. sediments with a high content of sand or silt, located in areas with steep slopes, are more easily eroded, as well as areas with weathered or broken rock. the porosity and permeability of sediments or rocks have an impact on the speed of erosion, related to whether or not water seeps easily into the soil. If water moves underground, less surface runoff is formed, reducing surface erosion. Sediments that contain a lot of clay tend to erode more easily than sand or silt. The impact of sodium in the atmosphere on the erodibility of the clay should also be considered. The most variable factor is the amount and type of land cover. In untouched forests, soil minerals are protected by a layer of humus and an organic layer. these two layers protect the soil by dampening the impact of raindrops. the layers along with the litter on the forest floor are porous and easily absorb rainwater.",

Believed to have been founded by Charlemagne, Andorra was ruled by the Count of Urgell until 988, when Andorra was handed over to the Diocese of Urgell. The present principality was established by a treaty of 1278. Andorra is known as a principality because it is a diarchy headed by two princes: the Catholic Diocese of Urgell in Catalonia, Spain, and the President of France. This luxurious country is famous for its tourism sector and duty-free status. Andorra is part of the Catalan countries. Andorra is the 6th smallest country in Europe, has an area of \u200b\u200b468 square kilometers and a population of approximately 77,006. The people of Andorra are an ethnic group of Romans who are originally of Catalan descent. Andorra is the 16th smallest country in the world by area and the 11th smallest in the world by population. Its seat of government, Andorra la Vella, is the highest major city in Europe, at 1,023 meters above sea level. The official language of the country is Catalan, but Spanish, Portuguese and French are also commonly spoken. Andorra is visited by approximately 10.2 million tourists annually. Andorra is not a member of the European Union, but the euro is its official currency. Andorra has been a member of the United Nations since 1993.

The word Andosini or Andosins (\u1f08\u03bd\u03b4\u03bf\u03c3\u03af\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9) is probably derived from the Basque handia meaning \"big\" or \"giant\". Andorra's toponymy shows evidence of the Basque language in that region. Another theory suggests that the word Andorra may have come from an old Anorra word which includes the Basque word ur (water). Another theory suggests that Andorra may derive from the Arabic al-durra, which means \"forest\" (\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0631\u0629). When the Arabs and Moors conquered the Iberian Peninsula, the valleys of the High Pyrenees which were covered by large tracts of forest, and most of the areas not managed by the Muslims, because of the geographical difficulties that existed, earned this title. Other theories suggest that the term Andorra is derived from the Navarra-Aragonese andurrial, meaning \"land covered with thickets\". Folk etymology holds that Charlemagne had named this region in reference to the biblical valley around Canaan, namely Endor (where the Midianites were defeated), a name which had been given by his heir and son, Louis the Pious after defeating the Moors in the \"valleys of wild valley of Hell\". Tradition holds that Charlemagne granted a charter to the people of Andorra in exchange for their war against the Moors. The lordship of the area passed to the local Urgell prince and eventually to the bishop of the Urgell diocese. In the 11th century, there was a dispute between the bishop and his northern French neighbor over Andorra. In 1278, the conflict was resolved by the signing of the parage, which stipulated that sovereignty of Andorra be held between the French count of Foix (whose office eventually passed to the French head of state) and the bishop of La Seu d'Urgell, in Catalonia, Spain.",

Today Tokelau still has the status of a territory of New Zealand under the Tokelau Act 1948. The defense sector is the responsibility of the mother country. Like Niue and the Cook Islands, the people of Tokelau are drafting a constitution and developing institutions and patterns of self-government to form free association with New Zealand. The head of state for Tokelau is Queen Elizabeth II, represented by Administrator Neil Walter. The position of head of government is held by Pio Tuia who chairs the Faipule Council, consisting of a cabinet of three elected leaders from each atoll. The monarchy is hereditary, administrators are appointed by New Zealand's Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the head of government is selected from among the members of the Faipule Council for a one-year term. On November 11, 2004, Tokelau and New Zealand took steps to form an agreement that would change Tokelau's status from a territory of New Zealand to a territory of free association with New Zealand.

The term tungsten comes from the Swedish tung sten, meaning heavy stone. Its name in Swedish is volfram, but to differentiate it from scheelit, it is given the alternative name tungsten in Swedish. Natural tungsten is found on earth almost always as a chemical compound. It is a rare metal that is hard at standard conditions when not combined. It was identified as a new element in 1781, and first isolated in 1783. Important tungsten ores include wolframite and scheelite. Its free elemental resistance is remarkable, especially the fact that it has the highest melting point of all the elements discovered. It melts at 3,422\u00b0C (6,192\u00b0F). Its high density is up to 19.3 times that of water, comparable to uranium and gold, and higher (about 1.7 times) than lead. Polycrystalline tungsten is a brittle and hard material, making it difficult to work with. However, pure single-crystalline tungsten is more ductile, and can be cut using a hard steel saw. Many tungsten alloys have a variety of applications, including incandescent lamp filaments, X-ray tubes (both as filaments and targets), electrodes in WIG welding, superalloys, vacuum tubes, and radiation shielding. The hardness and high density of tungsten provide it with military applications in penetrating projectiles. Tungsten compounds are also often used as industrial catalysts. Tungsten is the only metal of the third transition series known to occur in biomolecules, which is used by several species of bacteria and archaea. It is the heaviest element known to be essential for living organisms. Tungsten interferes with molybdenum and copper metabolism and is mildly toxic to animal life.",

When made very pure, tungsten retains its hardness (which exceeds that of most steels), and becomes malleable enough to be easily machined. It is processed by forging, drawing, or extrusion. Tungsten objects are also commonly formed by sintering. Of all the metals in its pure form, tungsten has the highest melting point (3,422\u00b0C (6,192\u00b0F)), lowest vapor pressure (at temperatures above 1,650\u00b0C (3,000\u00b0F)) and highest tensile strength. Although carbon remains solid at higher temperatures than tungsten, it sublimes at atmospheric pressure rather than melting, and so has no melting point. Tungsten has the lowest coefficient of thermal expansion of any pure metal. The low thermal expansion and high melting point and tensile strength of tungsten stem from the strong covalent bonds formed between the tungsten atoms by the 5d electrons. Alloying small amounts of tungsten with steel greatly increases its toughness. Tungsten exists in two main crystalline forms: \u03b1 and \u03b2. The first form has a body-centered cubic structure and is a more stable form. The \u03b2-phase structure is called cubic A15; it is metastable, but may coexist with the \u03b1 phase under ambient conditions due to synthesis or non-equilibrium stabilization by impurities. In contrast to the \u03b1 phase which crystallizes in isometric grains, the \u03b2 form exhibits a columnar stature. The \u03b1 phase has one third the electrical resistivity and a much lower TC superconducting transition temperature than the \u03b2 phase: ca. 0.015 K vs 1-4 K; mixing the two phases allows obtaining intermediate TC values. The TC value can also be increased by alloying tungsten with other metals (eg 7.9 K for W-Tc). Such tungsten alloys are sometimes used in low temperature superconducting circuits.",

With its unique shape, pattern and taste, chocolate is often used as an expression of gratitude, sympathy or attention and even as a declaration of love. Chocolate has also become one of the most popular flavors in the world. Apart from being consumed most commonly in the form of chocolate bars, chocolate is also an ingredient in warm and cold drinks. Chocolate is produced from cocoa (Theobroma cacao) which is thought to have originally grown in the northern Amazon region to Central America. Maybe as far as Chiapas, the southernmost part of Mexico. The Olmec people took advantage of the trees and, possibly, made \"chocolate\" along the coast of the gulf in southern Mexico. The earliest documentation of chocolate is found on its use at a chocolate processing site in Puerto Escondido, Honduras around 1100 -1400 years BC. The residue obtained from these processing tanks indicates that initially the use of cocoa was not only intended for making drinks, but the white membrane found on cocoa beans was more likely to be used as a source of sugar for alcoholic beverages. Chocolate residue found on pottery used by the ancient Mayans in R\u00edo Azul, Northern Guatemala, indicates that the Mayans drank chocolate around 400 BC. The first civilization to inhabit the Meso-America area knew the \"kakawa\" tree whose fruit was consumed as a xocol\u0101tl drink which means bitter drink. According to them, this drink needs to be consumed every day, for whatever reason.",

By holding the vessel of this liquid at chest level and pouring it into another vessel on the ground, the skilled server can create a thick froth, part of which makes the drink so valuable. This foam is actually produced by cocoa fat (cocoa butter) but sometimes additional foam is also added. Meso-Americans seem to have important habits of drinking and eating mush containing chocolate. The seeds of the cacao tree are themselves very bitter and must be fermented for the taste to be obtained. After baking and powdering the result is chocolate or cocoa. It is estimated that the Mayan habit of drinking chocolate began around 450 BC - 500 BC. It is said that the consumption of chocolate is considered as an important status symbol in those days. The Mayans consumed chocolate in the form of a frothy liquid sprinkled with red pepper, vanilla or other spices. Xocoatl drink is also believed to prevent fatigue, a belief that may be due to the theobromine content in it. When the classical Mayan civilization collapsed (around 900) and was replaced by the Toltecs, cocoa beans became a major Meso-American commodity. During the time of the Aztec Empire (until about 1500 BC) the area that includes present-day Mexico City was known as the Meso-America area most rich in cocoa beans. For the Aztecs cocoa beans were \"food of the gods\" (theobroma, from Greek). Usually cocoa beans are used in religious ceremonies and as gifts. Chocolate also became a luxury item during the Colombian-Meso American period, in their cultures, namely the Mayans, Toltecs, and Aztecs, cocoa beans (cacao beans) were often used as currency. For example, the Aztec Indians used a calculation system where one turkey chicken cost one hundred cocoa beans and one avocado cost three cocoa beans.",

This hypothesis about social change grows out of resistance to revolutionary socialism, which argues that revolution is necessary for fundamental structural changes to occur. Reformism must be distinguished from pragmatic reform: reformism is the view that an accumulation of reforms can lead to the formation of a socio-economic system that is completely different from current forms of capitalism and democracy, whereas pragmatic reform represents an effort to maintain the status quo against fundamental and structural changes. There are two kinds of reformism. The former have no desire to bring socialism or fundamental economic changes to society and are used to resist structural change. The second is based on the opinion that while reform is not socialism itself, it can help unite its supporters for the cause of the revolution by popularizing socialism among the working class. The debate over the ability of social democratic reformism to lead the socialist transformation of society has been going on for a century. Reformism was criticized for being paradoxical: trying to overcome the existing capitalist economic system, but also trying to improve the conditions of capitalism so that it actually made capitalism look more acceptable to society. According to Rosa Luxemburg, under reformism, \"(capitalism) is not overthrown, but on the contrary will be strengthened by the development of social reforms.\" In a similar vein, Stan Parker of the Socialist Party of Great Britain argued that reformism was a transfer of power away from the socialists and limited, because they had to obey the logic of capitalism. French social theorist Andre Gorz criticized reformism by advocating a third alternative to reformism and social revolution which he called \"non-reformist reforms\". \"Non-reformist reforms\" are reforms that specifically focus on structural changes to capitalism, as opposed to reforms to improve living conditions within capitalism, or sustain it through economic intervention.",

Reformism became an immediate target of criticism of revolutionary socialism, with Rosa Luxemburg condemning Bernstein's Evolutionary Socialism in 1900 in her essay Reform or Revolution?. When Luxemburg died in the German Revolution, the reformists began to confront the Bolsheviks and their satellite communist party for the support of the intelligentsia and the working class. In 1959, the Godesberg Program (adopted at a party convention in the West German capital Bad Godesberg) marked the shift of the German Social Democratic Party (SDP) from a Marxist program to end capitalism, to a reformist one focused on social reform. After Joseph Stalin consolidated power in the Soviet Union, the Comintern launched a campaign against the Reformist movement by denouncing them as \"social fascists\".

Cations are positively charged ions, while anions are negatively charged ions. Therefore, a cation molecule has a hydrogen proton without an electron, whereas an anion has an extra electron. Because of their opposite electrical charges, cations and anions are attracted to each other and easily form ionic compounds. Ions containing only one atom are called monatomic ions or atomic ions, while those containing two or more atoms form molecular ions or polyatomic ions. In the case of physical ionization in a medium, such as a gas, \"ion pairs\" are created by collisions of ions, where each pair formed contains a free electron and a positive ion. Ions are also created through chemical interactions, for example dissolving a salt in a liquid, or alternatively, passing a direct current through a conducting solution dissolves the anode via ionization. The word ion comes from the Greek: \u1f30\u03cc\u03bd, ion, \"is going\", the verb being forms from the Greek: \u1f30\u03ad\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9, ienai, \"goes\". The term was introduced by the English physicist and chemist Michael Faraday in 1834 to describe an unknown species that travels from one electrode to another via an aqueous medium. Faraday did not know the nature of these species, but he did know that when a metal dissolves into and enters the solution at one electrode, a new metal arises from the solution at the other electrode; the substance has moved through the solution in a current. It carries matter from one place to another. Faraday also introduced the words anion for a negatively charged ion, and a cation for a positively charged ion.",

Svante Arrhenius proposed his explanation, in his 1884 dissertation, that in fact solid crystalline salts dissociate into pairs of charged particles when dissolved. This dissertation earned Arrhenius the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1903. Arrhenius' explanation was that in forming a solution, the salt dissociates into Faraday ions. Arrhenius proposed that ions were formed even in the absence of an electric current. Ions in their gaseous state are highly reactive and will quickly interact with ions with opposite charges to produce neutral molecules or ionic salts. Ions are also produced in the liquid or solid state when salts interact with a solvent (eg, water) to produce \"solvated ions\", which are more stable. The ions move away from each other to interact with the liquid for reasons that involve changes in energy and entropy. These stabilized species are more common in low temperature environments. A common example is the ions found in seawater, which come from dissolved salts. All ions have a charge, which means that, like other charged objects, they: Electrons, due to their small mass and large space-occupying properties, are considered matter waves. It determines the entire size of atoms and molecules that have electrons. Anions (negatively charged ions) are larger than the parent molecule or atom, because the excess electrons repel each other thereby increasing the physical size of the ion, and its size is determined by its electron cloud. Thus, in general, cations are smaller than their parent atoms or molecules because the size of their electron cloud is also smaller. The hydrogen cation has no electrons at all, so it only has a single proton - much smaller than the hydrogen atom.",

These diverse topics reflect the wide variety of disciplines that oceanographers combine to deepen their knowledge of the world's oceans and understand the processes within them, namely astronomy, biology, chemistry, climatology, geography, geology, hydrology, meteorology, and physics. Paleoceanography studies the history of the oceans in terms of their geological history. Humans first learned about the waves and currents of the seas and oceans in prehistoric times. Observations of the tides were recorded by Aristotle and Strabo. Early exploration of the ocean was only for cartography and limited to the surface and animals caught by fishermen, even though at that time measurements of the depth of the sea using tin had already been carried out.

Experts in the field of psychotherapy are psychologists and counselors. Psychotherapy is a form of clinical intervention. The type of disease that can be treated by psychotherapy is a mental disorder. Treatment is carried out in psychotherapy only related to thoughts, feelings and behavior. Psychotherapy is one of the main clinical treatment methods for people with depression. The term psychotherapy comes from the Ancient Greek, namely psyche (soul) and therapeia (to treat, treat, heal). In the Big Indonesian Dictionary, psychotherapy is defined as \"a method of treatment by using the influence (inner power) of a doctor on the soul (spiritual) of the sufferer, by not using drugs, but by using the method of suggestion, advice, entertainment, hypnosis, and so on\". Psychotherapy is different from counseling in terms of its goals. The purpose of counseling is more limited when compared to psychotherapy. Counseling only aims to influence a person's development momentarily by involving oneself. The result achieved from counseling is the return of the function of a person according to his role. Psychotherapy has a bigger purpose because it results not only in changing the fundamental structure of personality in the present, but also for the future. So, psychotherapy has three goals at once, namely therapy, adjustment and remediation. Psychotherapy and guidance and counseling are both methods of intervention. Another difference between psychotherapy and counseling is in terms of the level of problems of the patient and the reasons for applying it. Psychotherapy mostly only deals with problems that are classified as serious problems. Psychotherapy and counseling have similarities in terms of demand because both are only done at the request of the patient. While guidance can be done without any request from the patient.

Psychiatric psychotherapy is a type of holistic therapy that aims to restore the self-confidence of the patient. Another goal of psychiatric psychotherapy is to improve ego function in patients. Transpersonal psychotherapy aims to increase the transcendence of mind awareness so that it can make it explore consciousness. The result achieved from transpersonal psychotherapy is transpersonal awareness which results in true self-disclosure. Transpersonal psychotherapy techniques include meditation and prayer. Psychoanalysis is a technique used to provide a description of psychological qualities and their changes. Psychoanalysis is applied in psychotherapy to determine a person's personality. The person who first pioneered psychoanalysis was Sigmund Freud. Clinical treatment in psychoanalysis includes acts of hypnosis, catharsis, free association, and dream analysis. Logotherapy is a psychotherapeutic technique created by Viktor Frankl. The basic principle of logotherapy is meaning which is further divided into three types. The principle begins by providing the view that life always has meaning even in the most deplorable conditions. The second principle is the view that the purpose of life is to find meaning in life itself. The third principle is that humans have the freedom to interpret every action they take and experience even though it has tribulations. In the science of mental health, prayer and remembrance are types of psychiatric therapy. Its level is higher than common psychotherapeutic techniques.

This can be said as an object, phenomenon, explanation, theory, and understanding. Reductionism clearly describes a fixed perspective from causality. In a reductionist framework, phenomena can be explained entirely in terms of relationships among other more fundamental phenomena, which are called epiphenomena. There is often the implication that epiphenomenon use causal intermediaries in the underlying phenomena that explain them. Reductionism does not preclude the existence of what are commonly called emergent phenomena, but it does imply the ability to understand these phenomena more fully in terms of the processes by which they are formed. This reductionist understanding is quite different from that usually implied by the term emergence, which specifically means that what arises is more than the sum of the processes by which it arises. Religious reductionism in general tries to explain religion by mingling it with certain causes of non-religious views. Some examples of reductionistic explanations for the existence of religion: that religion is reducible to human concepts of right and wrong, that religion is essentially a primitive attempt at controlling our environment, and that religion is a way of explaining the existence of the physical world. Anthropologists Edward Burnett Tylor and James George Frazer make use of some of the religious reductionist arguments. Sigmund Freud had the idea that religion was nothing more than an illusion, or even a mental illness, and Marxists saw religion as the \"breath of the oppressed\", providing only the \"illusory happiness of the people,\" both of which were influential reductionist views of religion.",

Theoretical reduction is the process by which one theory absorbs another theory. For example, Kepler's laws of planetary motion and Galileo's theories of motion in terrestrial bodies were both reduced to Newton's theories of mechanics, since all the explanatory power of the old theory was contained in the latter. Furthermore, reduction is considered a more useful theory because Newton's theory of mechanics is a more general theory, it explains more events than Kepler's or Galileo's Theories. Therefore, the theory of reductionism is the reduction of an explanation or theory to another theory, that is what is meant by the absorption of an idea about specific things into another idea. Methodological reductionism is a position that is at best scientific strategy in an attempt to simplify explanations to the smallest possible entities. Thus, methodological reductionism would insist that an atomic explanation of the boiling point of a substance is better than a chemical explanation, and that an explanation of even smaller particles would be even better. Therefore, methodological reductionism is the position that all scientific theories can or must be reduced to a single super theory through a process of theoretical reduction. Ontological reductionism is the belief that reality consists of a minimum amount of some kind of entity or substance.

Fasting Rules There are several fasting rules that Orthodox Christians must follow, namely: However, there are some waivers for not fasting for children who don't understand what fasting is, very old people, nursing mothers, those who are physically weak, are sick which if fasting will exacerbate the disease and endanger the life.",

Blood supplies oxygen and nutrients to the body, also helps remove metabolic wastes. The term cardiac means related to the heart, from the Greek cardia for heart. The heart is one of the human organs that plays a role in the circulatory system, located in the chest cavity slightly to the left. In humans, mammals, and birds, the heart is divided into four segments: the right and left upper atrium; and right and left lower ventricles. In general, the right atrium and ventricle are called the right heart, and the rest are called the left heart. Fish have only two segments, an atrium and a ventricle, while reptiles have three. In a healthy heart, blood flows in one direction through the blood vessels. There is a sac that protects the heart, the pericardium, which also contains a small amount of fluid. The heart wall is composed of three layers: epicardium, myocardium, and endocardium. The heart pumps blood through two circulatory systems. Blood originating from the greater circulatory system contains little oxygen and enters the right atrium through the superior and inferior vena cava to the right ventricle. From here the blood is pumped to the lungs, where it picks up oxygen and leaves carbon dioxide. Oxygenated blood returns to the left atrium, passes through the left ventricle and is pumped to the rest of the body via the aorta\u2014where oxygen is used and metabolized to carbon dioxide. In addition, blood also carries nutrients from the liver to various organs of the body, while carrying waste products to the liver and kidneys. Normally, the amount of blood pumped to the lungs equals the amount of blood pumped throughout the body.",

Arteries carry blood away from the heart, carry oxygen apart from the pulmonary arteries. Long distance from the heart makes veins have less pressure than arteries. When resting, the heart beats approximately 72 times per minute. Physical exercise usually raises the amount, but the amount slows down over time, which is good for the heart. Cardiovascular disease was a common cause of death in 2008, accounting for 30% of people's deaths. Followed by coronary artery disease and stroke. The main causes are: smoking, obesity, lack of exercise, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, and others. The diagnosis of cardiovascular disease is often made with a stethoscope, ECG or ultrasound. Specialists who focus on heart disease are called cardiologists, although other specialists are needed to treat them. The heart is a single muscle composed of layers of endothelium. The heart is located in the thoracic cavity, behind the sternum. The heart structure turns downward and slightly to the left. Its mass is approximately 300 grams, the size of a fist. The heart is almost completely enveloped by the lungs, but is covered by a double membrane called the pericardium, which is attached to the diaphragm. The first layer attaches very tightly to the heart, while the outer layer is more loose and watery, to avoid friction between the organs in the body that occurs due to the heart's constant pumping motion. The heart is kept in place by blood vessels that cover flat areas of the heart, such as the base and sides. The two lines of division (formed of muscle) in the outer layers of the heart indicate where the dividing walls between the atria and the chambers of the heart are.",

Several other philosophers belonging to the Old Pythagorean school were Cercops, Petron, Brontinus, Kalliphon, Democedes, and Parmeniscus. There are no surviving written works of any of these philosophers, including Hippasus. When the Pythagorean school split into two groups, akusmatikoi and mathematikoi, Hippasos became the leader of the mathematikoi group. The akusmatikoi group saw the need to strictly obey all the rules of the Pythagorean school, while the mathematikoi group prioritized teaching science, especially physics. Hippasos hails from the city of Metapontum. Since he was a member of the Pythagorean school, it meant that he had also lived in Kroton. He lived and worked in the 5th century BC, that is, before the Pythagorean school was closed. Apart from that, it is also known that he lived at the same time as Philolaos, so it is estimated that he worked around 470 BC. According to information from Aristotle, Hippasos was of the view that fire was the basic principle of everything. This view is similar to the philosophical views of Herakleitos. However, W.K.C Guthrie said that Hippasos' view of fire was not like Herakleitos' meaning because in the Pythagorean view, fire had a special position. According to the testimony of Diogenes Laertius, Hippasos argued that the universe (cosmos) reaches the fullness of all its changes at certain periods. This view represents the Pythagorean doctrine of the continuously repeating cycles of history. From the testimony of Claudianus Mamertus, it is also known that Hippasos viewed the soul and body as separate from one another. The soul lives on when the body dies.

People who behave apathetic tend not to care about their emotional, social or even physical nature of life. The word apathy comes from the Greek word \"pathos\", which means emotion or passion. The cause of apathy is a lack of emotion and passion in life which results in a condition of indifference, lack of passion or emotion and insensitivity to the point of affecting everyday social life. In the medical world, apathy is a condition that afflicts individuals with the characteristic of moral dullness and seems to be insensitive to the pain they suffer, causing the sufferer to be lazy to think and move to do something. Apathy is often considered a syndrome or a collection of symptoms. What often appears is unproductive behavior in carrying out daily activities, lack of motivation to achieve desires or goals, not caring about the goals that have been planned to be achieved, loss of desire to pay attention or care for oneself, the desire to participate in various social activities is very low or tends to not at all, does not have a good emotional response to good news or bad news, has difficulty showing any form of feeling, whether happy, angry, or angry. In addition, people who are apathetic are less likely to produce any creativity or work. This happens because the ego in itself is very dominant so that it will not experience life development and will no longer have competitiveness. There are three types of apathy. First, emotional apathy with the characteristics of people who lack positive emotions and negative emotions.

Next is what is called compassion fatigue, which is emotional exhaustion from feeling compassion, so there is no longer a sense of caring for other people. Apathy can be detrimental to oneself or those around it. First, the resulting impact is a lack of social control caused by an attitude of not caring or not being interested in things at all. Second, apathetic people and those around them tend to have difficulty developing, due to a lack of awareness or concern for themselves, others, and their surroundings. Third, there is the potential for individualism in a society so that it strengthens everyone without caring about others. Fourth, apathy can potentially cause enormous problems, such as disputes or divisions between communities and becomes a latent danger that can threaten the fragility of unity. Several potential therapies, such as cognitive stimulation therapy or electrotherapy cranial stimulation are urgently needed to treat chronic apathy. Steps to overcome apathy include pushing yourself to socialize and spend a lot of time with colleagues in an association, doing anything you really like, such as watching concerts or movies with loved ones, taking courses or art therapy classes (music, fine arts). , dance), try to do sports activities regularly, reward yourself after completing planned activities, get enough sleep every night, join the support of apathetic people who want to change to be a better person.",

A university provides undergraduate and postgraduate education. The word university comes from the Latin university magistrorum et scholarium, which means \"community of teachers and academics\". The university's long-standing predecessors existed in Asia and Africa, but the modern university system has its roots in Medieval universities in Europe, which were created in Italy and are essentially rooted in Christian schools for clergy during the High Middle Ages. The original Latin word, university, generally means \"people associated with an agency, society, company, community, group of workers, corporation, etc.\" With the development of urban life, as well as the emergence of workers' groups in the Middle Ages, the term's meaning later developed into \"an association of students and teachers with collective legal rights usually agreed to in a pact issued by the prince or the lord of their city\". Like other working groups, the university at that time had its own rules and was free to determine the qualifications of its own members. In modern times, the meaning of the word has changed to \"an institution of higher learning that offers instruction in non-vocational fields and usually has the power to award degrees\". An important concept that distinguishes universities from others is the concept of academic freedom. The first document that provides evidence of this is a document from the University of Bologna, namely an academic treaty entitled Constitutio Habita which came out in 1158 or 1155.",

The number of universities that are signatories to the Magna Charta Universitatum continues to grow from around the world. According to the Encyclopedia Britannica, the ancestors of universities were in Asia and Africa and existed earlier than medieval universities in Europe. Some consider Al Quaraouiyine University founded in Morocco by Fatima al Fihri in 859 to be the oldest degree-granting university in the world. There are some similarities between the early universities established in the area around the Mediterranean Sea and madrasas in Islam. The difference is that madrasas are usually smaller and those who award titles are usually the teachers in the madrasa itself and not the madrasah itself. Historians such as Arnold H. Green and Hossein Nasr argue that as early as the 10th century, there were several Islamic madrasas that were turned into universities. However, other historians such as George Makdisi, Toby Huff and Norman Daniel argue that the European-style university has nothing in common with anything that existed in the medieval Islamic world. There are other scientists who argue that the university concept is originally from Europe, both in history and in characteristics. Darleen Pryds questions this and points out that the various European madrasas and universities in the Mediterranean Sea area share similar characteristics, namely that they both received funding from the nobility and were created to supply local bureaucrats loyal to the government's agenda.",

Included in postmodernism are skeptical interpretations of culture, literature, art, philosophy, history, economics, architecture, fiction, and literary criticism. Postmodernism is often associated with deconstruction and poststructuralism because its use as a term gained significant popularity at the same time as poststructuralism, namely in the twentieth century. Postmodernism is an understanding that developed after the modern era with its modernism. Postmodernism is not a single understanding or a theory, but rather an umbrella for various scattered theories and it is difficult to find a single common ground. Many figures give the meaning of postmodernism as a continuation of modernism. But the continuation became very mixed. For Lyotard and Geldner, postmodernism is a complete break from modernism. For Derrida, Foucault and Baudrillard, postmodernism is a radical form of modernity which eventually \"turns itself off\" because of the difficulty of homogenizing various theories. For David Graffin, postmodernism is a correction of some aspects of modernism. In addition, for Giddens, postmodernism is a form of modernism that has become self-aware and has become wise. Finally, for Habermas, postmodernism is an unfinished stage of modernism. Based on the origin of the word, postmodernism, comes from English which means understanding (-ism) which developed after (post) modern. The term first appeared in 1930 in art by Federico de Onis to indicate a reaction from modernism. Then in the field of History by Toyn Bee in his book Study of History in 1947. After that it developed in other fields and carried out criticism of modernism in its own fields. Postmodernism is distinguished from postmodernity.

Even more unusual is Horary Astrology. Most western astrologers base their work on the tropical zodiac, but western and Jyotish astrologers use the sideral zodiac. Astrology is not completely the same as astronomy. Astronomy is often confused with astrology, and vice versa. Because many scientists consider that astrology does not follow the scientific method, most of them generally reject astrology to be an astronomical science and simply classify it as a pseudoscience. Astrology was once deeply connected with astronomy, and the clear differences between the two were discovered back in the time of Galileo. He was the first to use the scientific method to test objective statements about the sky. Astronomy is meant to understand the physical workings of the universe. This is especially interesting and relevant in astrology. The main focus of most forms of astrology is on unproven correlations between the physical movements of the celestial bodies, and various human affairs, such as world events, events in the personal psyche of people, and innate personality traits. Other astrologers extend this correlation to unrelated geological phenomena to human activities, such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.

There are some biological phenomena that coordinate with the movements of the heavens (eg circadian rhythms, see Chronobiology). This neither proves nor disproves astrological claims, but suggests influences which are wholly incomprehensible. Attempts by scientists to prove the influence of astrology have yielded negative or inconclusive results, for disputed reasons. Scientists would say astrology has no basis in fact, and therefore cannot be proven. Astrologers will say scientists have poorly designed studies because they don't understand astrology enough. Astrological concepts permeate many societies, and persist despite vigorous attempts by scientists to discredit them. This is proven by the fact that influenza was so named because doctors once believed it to be caused by adverse planetary and special influences. Astrology can also be seen as a system of cultural symbolism because it talks about thoughts and figures in Western culture. It has traces in the Alchemical and Hermetic traditions which were very influential until the 17th century. Only through understanding the astrological system to analyze human behavior can much Western thought and literature until the Enlightenment be fully understood. Many modern thinkers, especially Carl Jung, have acknowledged the descriptive powers of thought without necessarily subscribing to its predictive claims.

The term ecofeminism was first introduced in 1974 by Fran\u00e7oise d'Eaubonne. In its application, ecofeminism applies a caring ethic to realize social justice ecologically, prioritizes the value of femininity and opposes patriarchal culture. In 1968, Paul Ehrlich published his book The Population Bomb. This book discusses the damage to the earth as a result of too much human population. The solution offered by him is to stop sexual reproduction. Fran\u00e7oise d'Eaubonne later criticized the book in his book Le F\u00e9minisme ou La Mort. He explained that women were not given the right to regulate their reproduction and the patriarchal system wanted reproduction to continue. Within its limitations, women can still achieve emancipation by opposing the patriarchal system through abortion and contraception. The book Le F\u00e9minism ou La Mort, written in 1974, introduced the term \"ecofeminism\" for the first time. Afterwards, this book discusses preventing the destruction of the earth by social movements led by women. In this case, the eco-feminism movement is protecting the earth by making it better by returning it to its original state. Ecofeminism makes social reality as the impact of social processes in society. Society is a human product with the unique fact that humans are also a product of society. Social interaction between humans in a society will develop into the interaction of society and its environment. Ecofeminism stipulates that cooperation, caring, love and tolerance are ways to preserve nature where humans live.

The relationship between the two is described as a family consisting of members who do not oppress each other, but support each other. Ecofeminism makes admiration the main activity to gain knowledge in a feminist way. Through awe, social reality about the universe can be known. Knowledge based on awe then leads to positive environmental development. Ecofeminism applies human friendship with nature as a basis for taking action. Femininity becomes the main principle in every action. In its implementation, matriarchal culture is prioritized so that every action taken is always based on an emotional connection. The ecofeminism movement originated from criticism of liberalist feminism and socialist feminism, this criticism was first made by Susan Gordon in her book entitled The Prisoner of Men's Dream. He explained that feminism has become the destroyer of the world and has made women an imitation of men in a patriarchal system. Susan and other social activists have the idea that women and men don't have to be the same, but that the quality of life for both should be the same. These shared qualities must then change the world for the better without causing harm. Ecofeminist activists then began to criticize patriarchal culture and capitalism. Apart from that, they also criticize the culture of production and reproduction in relation to the dangers from the development of industrial technology and women's safety. Ecofeminism is based on an ethic of caring that exists because of the nature of women.

It is the most common transistor in both digital and analog circuits, but the bipolar junction transistor was at one time more common. MOSFETs were invented by Mohamed M. Atalla and Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs in 1959, and were first introduced in June 1960. These devices are the foundational building blocks of modern electronics, and are the most widely produced electronic devices in history, with a number of approx. approximately 13 sextillion (1.3\u00d71022) MOSFETs were produced between 1960 and 2018. MOSFETs are the dominant semiconductor devices in digital or analog integrated circuits (ICs), and are common power devices. MOSFETs are miniaturized and mass-produced solid state transistors for various forms of applications, revolutionizing the electronics industry and world economy, and critical to the digital revolution, the silicon age and the information age. The miniaturization of MOSFETs has driven the rapid development of electronic semiconductor technology since the 1960s, and made possible high-density ICs such as memory chips and microprocessors. The word 'metal' in the current name is actually a misnomer because the former metal-oxide layer of the gate material has now often been replaced with a layer of polysilicon (polycrystalline silicon). Previously aluminum was used as a gate material until the 1980s when polysilicon began to dominate with its ability to form self-adjusting gates. However, metal gates are now being used again because it is difficult to increase the operating speed of transistors without metal gates.

The basic principle of the field-effect transistor (FET) was first proposed by the Austrian-Hungarian physicist Julius Edgar Lilienfeld in 1926, when he was filling out the first patent for an isolated-gate field-effect transistor (IGFET). Over the next two years he explained various FET structures. In the MOS configuration aluminum is represented by M, aluminum oxide is represented by O, while copper sulphide is used as a semiconductor. However, he was unable to build a practical working FET device. The FET concept was later developed in theory by German engineer Oskar Heil in the 1930s and American physicist William Shockley in the 1940s. No practically working FETs were built at that time, and none of the early FET proposals involved thermally oxidizing silicon. Semiconductor companies initially focused on bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) in the early years of the semiconductor industry. However, junction transistors are relatively thick devices and difficult to mass produce, limiting their use to BJTs. In theory, FETs could be an alternative to junction transistors, but researchers have been unable to build practical FETs, mainly due to the surface state barrier preventing external electric fields from entering into the material. By the 1950s, researchers had mostly stopped trying the FET concept, and instead focused on BJT technology. In 1955, Carl Frosch and Lincoln Derrick accidentally coated the surface of a silicon wafer with a layer of silicon dioxide. They showed that the oxide layer prevented certain probes from entering the silicon wafer, while allowing others to enter. In doing so, they discovered the passivation effect of the oxidation of the semiconductor surface. Their next work was demonstrating how to etch tiny cracks in the oxide layer to spread the rivet over a specific part of the silicon wafer.",

This was followed by a second migration from the Carolina Islands in the first millennium AD, and a third migration from Island Southeast Asia (probably the Philippines or eastern Indonesia) in 900 AD. These native settlers of Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands evolved into the Chamoru people, historically known as Chamorros after first contact with the Spaniards. :16 The ancient Chamoru people had four classes: chamorri (tribal chief), matua (upper class), achaot (middle class), and mana'chang (lower class). :20\u201321 matua are located in coastal villages, meaning they have the best access to fishing grounds, whereas mana'chang is located inland.

Goguryeo is included in the Three Kingdoms of Korea along with the Kingdoms of Baekje and Silla and is the largest kingdom. Goguryeo was founded in 37 BC and ended in 668 AD. According to the Samguk Sagi, a prince of the East Buyeo kingdom named Jumong fled after a power struggle with other princes of the kingdom, and he founded a kingdom called Goguryeo in 37 BC in a place called Jolbon Buyeo. It is thought to be located in the middle of the Yalu and Tung-chia river valleys on the border of North Korea and Manchuria. Some historians believe that Goguryeo may have been founded earlier, namely in the 2nd century BC. In the ancient Chinese history book Han Shu, the word Goguryeo in Chinese characters (\u9ad8\u53e5\u9e97) was first written in 113 BC when it was a small country under the control of the Xuantu district. In the records of the Ancient Book of Tang, it is stated that Emperor Taizong of the Tang Dynasty mentioned that the history of Goguryeo was close to 900 years. In 75 BC, a tribal group called the Yemaek, thought to be an indigenous element of Goguryeo's population, made an attack on Xuantu District from the west of the Yalu River valley. However, written evidence from Tang historical books, the Samguk Sagi, Nihon Shoki and so on tends to favor 37 BC or mid-1st century BC for the founding of Goguryeo. Evidence from archaeological remains may support the existence of the Yemaek people in the 2nd century BC, but there is no direct evidence to explain whether they called their group Goguryeo people. The first mention of the word Goguryeo as a group associated with the Yemaek tribe can be found in references in Han Shu which tell of the Goguryeo rebellion in AD 12, when they broke away from Xuantu influence.",

The Samguk Sagi and Samguk Yusa paints additional detail and names Jumong's mother as Yuhwa. Jumong's real father is Hae Mosu who is called the mighty man or prince of heaven. The Samguk Sagi writes that Hae Mosu was a sky god. So the King of Buyeo gave Yuhwa shelter and appointed Jumong as his son, then prince. That said, Jumong was very talented, especially in archery and horse riding, which made the crown prince jealous. The crown prince plans to kill Jumong and when he learns of this plan Jumong flees from the palace. Korean inscriptions and historical sources contradict each other about the origins of Jumong. The Stele says he came from North Buyeo and the Samguk Sagi and Samguk Yusa say he came from East Buyeo. Jumong arrives at the Jolbon Buyeo confederation and marries the daughter of its lord king.

Calculus is the study of change, just as geometry studies shapes and algebra studies operations and their application to solving equations. Calculus has wide applications in science, economics, and engineering; and can solve various problems that cannot be solved with elementary algebra. Calculus has two main branches, differential calculus and integral calculus which are interconnected through the fundamental theorem of calculus. Examples of other branches of calculus are propositional calculus, calculus of variations, lambda calculus, and process calculus. Calculus lesson is a gateway to other higher mathematics lessons, which specifically study functions and limits, which are generally called mathematical analysis. The history of the development of calculus can be traced to several periods of time, namely ancient times, medieval times, and modern times. In the period of antiquity, some ideas about integral calculus had emerged, but they were not well developed and systematic. Calculations of volume and area which are the main functions of integral calculus can be traced back to the Egyptian Moscow Papyri (c. 1800 BC). On these papyri, the Egyptians were able to calculate the volume of a truncated pyramid. Archimedes took this idea further and created a heuristic that resembles integral calculus. In medieval times, the Indian mathematician Aryabhata used the concept of small infinity in 499 and expressed astronomical problems in the form of elementary differential equations. This equation then led Bh\u0101skara II in the 12th century to develop an initial form of the derivative that represented an infinitesimal change and explained an earlier form of \"Rolle's Theorem\". Around 1000, the Iraqi mathematician Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) was the first to derive a formula for calculating the product of the fourth power, and by using mathematical induction, he developed a method for deriving the general formula for the product of the power of the integral which was so important to the development of integral calculus .",

In the 14th century, Madhava, together with mathematicians-astronomers from the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics, described a special case of the Taylor series, which is described in the text of the Yuktibhasa. In modern times, independent discoveries were made in early 17th century Japan by mathematicians such as Seki Kowa. In Europe, mathematicians such as John Wallis and Isaac Barrow made breakthroughs in calculus. James Gregory proved a special case of the fundamental theorem of calculus in 1668. Leibniz and Newton pushed these ideas together as a unit and the two scientists are considered separate discoverers of calculus at about the same time. Newton applied general calculus to physics while Leibniz developed the calculus notations that are widely used today. When Newton and Leibniz published their results for the first time, there was controversy among mathematicians as to which was more deserving of credit for their work. Newton submitted his work first, but it was Leibniz who published it first. Newton accused Leibniz of stealing his ideas from unpublished notes, which Newton often lent to members of the Royal Society. A detailed examination shows that the two worked independently, with Leibniz starting from the integral and Newton from the derivative. Today, both Newton and Leibniz are credited with developing calculus independently. It was Leibniz who gave the name to this branch of mathematics as calculus, while Newton named it \"The science of fluxions\". Since then, many mathematicians have contributed to the further development of calculus.

Silica is produced in several forms including fused quartz, crystals, silica gel (or pyrogenic silica, trademarks Aerosil or Cab-O-Sil), colloidal silica, silica gel, and airgel. Silica is used primarily in the production of glass for windows, drinking glasses, beverage bottles, and many other uses. The majority of optical fiber for telecommunications is also made of silica. It is the main raw material for many ceramic whiteware such as pottery, ceramics, porcelain, as well as the Portland cement industry. Silica is a common additive in food production, where it is used primarily as a flow agent in powdered foods, or to absorb water in hygroscopic applications. It is the main component of diatomaceous earth which has many uses ranging from filtration to insect control. It is also a major component of rice husk ash which is used, for example, in the manufacture of filtration and cement. Silica thin films grown on silicon wafers via the thermal oxidation method can be very useful in microelectronics, where they act as electrical insulators with high chemical stability. In electrical applications, it can insulate silicon, store charges, block current, and even act as a controlled pathway to limit current flow.

Meanwhile, ethane is a hydrocarbon (more specifically, an alkane) consisting of two carbon atoms united by a single bond, each holding three carbon atoms: C2H6 and propane are hydrocarbons having three C atoms (C3H8) and so on with the structural formula CnH2 \u00b7n+2 (where n is the number of carbon/hydrogen atoms).

Because the molecular structures are different, the empirical formulas of the hydrocarbons are also different: the number of hydrocarbons bonded to alkenes and alkynes must be less because the carbon atoms are double bonded. The ability of hydrocarbons to bond with themselves is known as catenation, and this allows them to form more complex compounds, such as cyclohexane or arenes such as benzene. This ability is obtained because the characteristics of the bonds between carbon atoms are non-polar. In accordance with the valence bond theory, carbon atoms must comply with the \"4-hydrogen\" rule which states the maximum number of atoms that can bond with carbon, because carbon has 4 valence electrons. Judging from the valence electrons, carbon has 4 electrons which can form covalent bonds or dative bonds. Hydrocarbons are hydrophobic and belong to lipids.",

Addition reactions occur in alkenes and alkynes. In this reaction, a halogen molecule breaks the double bond in the alkene or the triple bond in the alkyne and forms a new bond. The common characteristics of hydrocarbons are that they produce steam, carbon dioxide, and heat during combustion, and oxygen is required for the combustion reactions to take place. The following is an example of a methane combustion reaction: If the air is poor in oxygen gas, carbon monoxide (CO) and water will be formed: Another example, the propane combustion reaction: The combustion reaction of hydrocarbons is an exothermic chemical reaction.

After being redefined in 2019, the definition of the unit mole, as stated in the ninth edition of the SI Brochure, is as follows. The mole, which is symbolized by the mole, is the SI unit of amount of substance. One mole contains exactly 6.02214076\u00d71023 elementary entities. This number, called Avogadro's number, is the fixed numerical value of Avogadro's constant NA when expressed in units of mol\u22121. The amount of substance, denoted by n, in a system is a measure of the amount of a given elementary entity. Elementary entities can be atoms, molecules, ions, electrons, other particles, or a particular group of particles. Previously, this unit was defined as the amount of chemical substance that contained a representative number of particles (now called elementary entities), such as atoms, molecules, ions, electrons, or photons, which was equivalent to the number of atoms in 12 grams of carbon-12 (12C), the isotope carbon with a definitive standard atomic weight of 12. This number was also previously expressed as Avogadro's number. Before being precisely defined in the redefinition, the Avogrado number was considered to be \"approximately\" to 6.022140857\u00d71023\u00a0mol\u22121. The mole is widely used in chemistry as a convenient way of expressing the amounts of reactants and products in a chemical reaction. For example, the equation 2 H2 + O2 \u2192 2 H2O means that 2 moles of dihydrogen (H2) and 1 mole of dioxygen (O2) react to form 2 moles of water (H2O). The mole is also used to express the number of atoms, ions or other elementary entities in a sample of a given substance. The concentration of a solution is commonly expressed as molarity, which is defined as the number of moles of solute per liter of solution. The number of molecules per mole is known as Avogadro's number, and is defined as the mass of one mole of a substance, expressed in grams, that is equal to the average relative molecular mass of the substance.",

The term gram-atom has been used for related but different concepts, namely the quantification of a substance containing as many atoms as Avogadro's number, whether in the form of isolated or discrete molecules. Therefore, for example, 1 mol of MgBr2 is 1 gram-molecule of MgBr2 but 3 gram-atoms of MgBr2. In honor of this unit, some chemists celebrate October 23, which is referred to on the scale of 1023 in Avogadro's number, as \"Mole Day\". Some also did the same on February 6 and June 2, referring to 6.02 of Avogadro's fix. As of 2011 update], the mole is defined by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures as the amount of substance of a system that contains the same number of elementary particles (e.g. atoms, molecules, ions, electrons, photons) as there are atoms in 0.012 kilograms of carbon-12 (12C), isotope of carbon with a standard atomic weight of 12. Thus, by this definition, one mole of pure 12C has a mass of exactly 12 g. Also from this definition, X moles of any substance will contain the same number of molecules as X moles of any other substance (although their masses may differ). The mass per mole of a substance is called the molar mass. Since the atomic mass unit (amu) is defined as 1/12 of the atomic mass of 12C, the molar mass of a substance, measured in grams per mole, is numerically equal to its average atomic or molecular mass measured in amu.

By the Soviets, the area was later divided between the Ukrainian SSR and the Moldovan SSR. In 1991, the Soviet Union collapsed, and Moldova declared independence on August 27, 1991. In September 1990, a separatist government was established in Transnistria (a region of Moldova). After the 1992 war, Transnistria became de facto independent, but no member of the United Nations recognized its independence. Moldova is a country located in Eastern Europe.

        "paragraph": "Plutonium is a chemical element in the periodic table that has the symbol Pu and atomic number 94. It is a rare radioactive transuranium element and is an actinide metal with a silvery-white appearance. When exposed to air, it tarnishes due to the formation of plutonium(IV) oxide covering the metal surface. This element basically has six allotropes and four oxidation states. It reacts with carbon, halogens, nitrogen and silicon. When exposed to humidity, it forms oxides and hydrides with a volume of 70% larger and becomes a spontaneously igniting powder. It is also a radiological poison that can accumulate in the bone marrow. Because of these properties, the handling of plutonium is quite hazardous, although the overall toxicity of the metal is sometimes exaggerated. The most important isotope of plutonium is plutonium-239 which has a half-life of 24,100 years. Plutonium-239 is fissile, that is, it can split apart when bombarded by thermal neutrons, releasing more energy, gamma radiation, and neutrons. Therefore, it can maintain the nuclear chain reaction after reaching critical mass. These properties allow plutonium to be used as a nuclear weapon and used in several nuclear reactors. The most stable isotope of plutonium is plutonium-244, with a half-life of about 80 million years. This half-life is long enough to be found naturally in small quantities. Plutonium-238 has a half-life of 88 years and emits alpha particles. It is the heat source in radioisotope thermoelectric generators (used in some spacecraft). Plutonium-240 has a high spontaneous fission rate which will increase the level of background neutrons in the sample. The presence of Pu-240 will limit the power and weapon potential of a sample. It is also used as a benchmark for determining plutonium grades: weapons grade (< 7%), fuel grade (7\u201319%), and reactor grade (> 19%).",

Element 94 was first synthesized by a group of scientists led by Glenn T. Seaborg and Edwin McMillan at the University of California, Berkeley in 1940. McMillan later named the new element plutonium (after Pluto). The discovery of plutonium later became a key part of the Manhattan Project to develop the atomic bomb during World War II. The first nuclear test, \"Trinity\" (July 1945), and the second atomic bomb (\"Fat Man\") used to destroy the city of Nagasaki (August 1945) had a Pu-239 core. Like many other metals, plutonium has a shiny silver appearance. However, when exposed to air, plutonium(IV) oxide forms rapidly and turns the metal a dull gray. In addition, yellow and olive green have also been reported. At room temperature, plutonium exists in its alpha allotopic form. This allotropic form is the most common form and has the hardness level of cast iron, except when it is alloyed with other metals and makes it soft and can be easily deformed. Unlike most metals, plutonium is not a very good conductor of heat and electricity. It has a low melting point (640\u00b0C) and a very high boiling point (3.327\u00b0C). Alpha particle emission, which is the release of high-energy helium nuclei, is the most common form of radiation emitted by plutonium. The heat released during the release and deceleration of these alpha particles makes softball-sized plutonium feel warm to the touch, whereas for plutonium's larger mass, it can boil a liter of water in a matter of minutes (which varies depending on the isotope composition).",

The most common reasons are usually due to differences in social status, race, and religion. In addition, concubinage occurs because there is a prohibition in society to have more than one wife. The practice of keeping a concubine or harem is a form of concubinage. Concubinage was a common practice during colonial times. The relationship that occurs is between landlords and women from among the natives or slaves who become their subordinates. This was made possible due to the lack of availability of women from equal social circles in the colonial lands. During the Dutch East Indies period, concubinage gave birth to a class of society which was later called Indos in the 19th and 20th centuries. In ancient China, a successful man usually had several concubines. One example is the documents that frequently record that the Emperor of China took in thousands of concubines. The treatment of concubines varied greatly, depending on the social status of the man or the attitude of the wife. The position of a concubine is usually lower than that of the original wife of a man.

Buddhism does not prohibit sex outside of marriage although adultery committed on a married person is considered a sexual offence. Buddhist precepts condemn fornication and monasticism. However, sexual activity between lay people is left to their discretion as long as it is not a sexual offense such as adultery of a married person (affection): sexual intercourse between two people is not in itself considered a sexual offence. In Islam, the perpetrators of adultery are divided into two, namely muhsan adulterers and muhsan ghairu. Muhshan adulterers are adulterers who already have a legal partner or are married (affairs), while ghairu muhsan adulterers are perpetrators who have never been married and do not have a legal partner (fornication).

The man called the Messenger of Allah and said, \"O Messenger of Allah, I have committed adultery, but I regret it.\" he repeated this four times.

As it leaves Graubuenden, the River Rhine flows north to form the border with Liechtenstein and then Austria, and then empties into Lake Constance. The Rhine then appears again, flows west, mainly on the border between Switzerland and Germany, falls at the Rhein falls, followed by the Aar which is more than 2 times its volume of water, and then turns north at Basel and forms the southern part of the border between Germany and France in the broad valley, before entering sheer Germany.

Glasses became known in Europe in the 13th century. But unlike the Chinese, Europeans use glasses to help their vision. The glasses worn are still similar to the glasses of the Chinese people, which are made of rock crystal or transparent stones.

This lens is formed and sharpened into a round stone that can be used for reading, so it is known as a reading stone. At the end of the thirteenth century, it was finally discovered that using glass as a lens was much better than using transparent stone. This is based on the results of research by a British scientist and historian named Sir Joseph Needham. His research shows that glasses were invented 1000 years ago in China and spread throughout the world at the time of Marco Polo's arrival in 1270. This was also mentioned by Marco Polo in his book.

As an epistemology (study of knowledge, its nature, and its validity), ethics (moral philosophy), and politics (civic citizenship), the field of postcolonialism deals with the politics of knowledge\u2014an issue that includes the postcolonial identity of a nation experiencing decolonization that stems from: (i) creation cultural knowledge about the colonized nation by the colonial nation; and (ii) how Western cultural knowledge was used to subjugate non-European nations to become colonies of the European mother country imposed after the initial attack through the cultural identities of \"colonizer\" and \"colonized\". Decolonized nations have postcolonial identities derived from cultural interactions with various identities (culture, nation, ethnicity) and social relations of sex, class, and caste; determined by the gender and race of the colonized; and racism embedded in the structure of colonial society.",

Alabama is directly bordered by Tennessee to the north, Georgia to the east, Florida and the Gulf of Mexico to the south, and Mississippi to the west. The 22nd-order state to join the Union, Alabama joined the Confederate States of America in 1861. After the Civil War, Alabama returned to the union in 1868. Alabama is also nicknamed Yellowhammer State, after the state bird. Alabama is also known as the \"Heart of Dixie\" and the \"Cotton State\". The state tree is the long leaf pine, and the state flower is the camellia. The capital city of Alabama is Montgomery. The city with the largest population is Birmingham, which has long been the most developed city. The largest city on the mainland is Huntsville. The oldest city is Mobile, founded by French colonists in 1702 as the capital of French Louisiana. The Greater Birmingham metropolitan area is the most populous urban area in Alabama. Alabama's name is taken from the Alabama River and the state comes from the Alabama people, a Muskogean-speaking tribe whose members live just below the confluence of the Coosa and Tallapoosa rivers in the upper reaches of the river. The spelling of the word \"Alabama\" varies widely among historical sources. The first usage appears in three accounts of Hernando de Soto's 1540 expedition: Garcilaso de la Vega uses Alibamo, while Ksatria Elvas and Rodrigo Ranjel write Alibamu and Limamu, respectively, in a transliteration of the term. As early as 1702, the French called the tribe Alibamon, with French maps identifying the river as the Riviere des Alibamons. Other spellings of the name include Alibamu, Alibamu, Alabamo, Albama, Alebamon, Alibama, Alibamou, Alabamu, Allibamou. The state has many place names derived from Native American origins.",

The English term is of Anglo-Norman origin and dates back to the 14th century, derived from the French Parliament of the 11th century, from \"parler\", meaning \"to speak\". This meaning evolved over time, originally referring to any discussion, conversation, or negotiation through various types of deliberative or judicial groups, often summoned by a king. In the 15th century, in England, it specifically meant the legislature. The legislature called parliament is administered by a government with a parliamentary system in which the executive is constitutionally responsible to the parliament. This can be compared to a presidential system where the legislature cannot elect or fire the head of government and conversely the executive cannot dissolve parliament. Several countries developed semi-presidential systems which combined a powerful President and an executive who was responsible to parliament. Parliaments can consist of several chambers or assemblies, and are usually unicameral or bicameral although there are more complex models. A Prime Minister (PM) is almost always a party leader who has a majority position in the lower house of parliament, but only holds that office for as long as parliament trusts him. If members of the lower house lose confidence for any reason, then they can file a vote of no confidence and force the PM to resign. This can be very dangerous for the stability of the government if the number of voting positions is relatively balanced. Since ancient times, when society was tribal, there was a village council or chief whose decisions were judged by village elders. This is called tribalism. Some scholars argue that in ancient Mesopotamia there was a primitive democratic government in which kings were judged by a council.",

However, Athenian democracy was not representative, but more direct, and therefore the ekklesia differed from the parliamentary system. The Roman Republic had a legislative assembly, which had the final say on the election of judges, the passing of new laws, the execution of capital punishment, declarations of war and peace, and the creation (or dissolution) of alliances. The Roman Senate controlled money, administration, and foreign policy details. Some Muslim scholars argue that the Islamic shura (a method of decision-making in an Islamic society) is analogous to parliament. However, others have highlighted what they consider to be fundamental differences between the shura system and the parliamentary system. The unicameral system (only one assembly of the legislature directly representing the people) became popular from the end of the XVIII century and the beginning of the XIX century. Initially the upper house was intended as the last defense of the power of the king and the nobles because they were directly or indirectly related to the king.

Metals are generally malleable\u2014that is, they can be hammered or pressed permanently into shape without chipping or cracking\u2014as well as fusible (can be melted down) and ductile (can be stretched to form fine wires). About 91 of the 118 elements in the periodic table are metals; the rest are non-metals or metalloids. Some elements exhibit both metallic and non-metallic properties. Astrophysicists use the term \"metal\" to collectively describe all the elements other than hydrogen and helium, the two simplest elements, in a star. The star fuses smaller atoms, mostly composed of hydrogen and helium, to create larger atoms during its lifetime. In that sense, the metallicity of an object is the proportion of matter that makes up all of the heavier chemical elements, not just the traditional metals. Many elements and compounds that are not normally classified as metals become metals at high pressure; it forms as a metallic allotropy of a nonmetal. Atoms of metallic substances are usually arranged in one of three common crystal structures, namely body-centered cubic (bcc), face-centered cubic (fcc), and hexagonal close-pack (hcp). In bcc, each atom is located at the center of the cube surrounded by other atoms. In fcc and hcp, each atom is surrounded by twelve other atoms, but the arrangement of the layers is different. Some metals adopt different structures, depending on temperature. Metal atoms easily lose their outer shell electrons, resulting in a cloud of free flowing electrons in their dense nature arrangement. This causes the ability of metals to easily conduct heat and electricity.",

Metals tend to form cations through electron loss mechanisms, reacting with oxygen in the air to form oxides over various time scales (iron rusts after years, while potassium burns in seconds. Examples: Transition metals (such as iron, copper, zinc, and nickel) ) are slower to oxidize because they form a passivation layer of the oxide that protects the interior of the metal. Others, such as palladium, platinum and gold, do not react at all with the atmosphere. Some metals form a barrier oxide layer on their surface that cannot be penetrated further by molecules oxygen, thereby retaining its luster and conductivity for decades (such as aluminum, magnesium, some steels, and titanium).Metal oxides are generally basic, as opposed to nonmetals, which are acidic.Exceptions are oxides with very high oxidation states such as CrO , Mn, and OsO, which reacted very hopelessly m. Painting, anodising or plating the metal are all good ways to prevent corrosion. However, the more reactive metal in the electrochemical series must be chosen for the coating, especially if the coating flakes are chosen. Water and the two metals form an electrochemical cell, and if the coating is less reactive than the coated substance, the coating has actually promoted corrosion. Metals generally have high electrical conductivity, high thermal conductivity, and high density. They are generally flexible and tough, deforming under pressure without splitting. In terms of its optical properties, metals are shiny and lustrous. Sheet metal under a few micrometers thick looks opaque, but the gold foil lets in a green glow.

An alkaline earth metal, strontium is a silver-white or yellowish soft metallic element that is highly reactive chemically. the metal forms a dark oxide layer when exposed to air. Strontium has similar physical and chemical properties to its two vertical neighbors in the periodic table, calcium and barium. It occurs naturally in the minerals Celestine, strontianite, and putnisite, and is mined in most of the first two of these. While natural strontium is stable, the synthetic isotope 90Sr is radioactive and is one of the most dangerous components of nuclear fallout, as strontium is absorbed by the body in a similar way to calcium. Stable natural strontium, on the other hand, is not harmful to health. Both strontium and strontianite are named after Strontian, a village in Scotland near which the mineral was discovered in 1790 by Adair Crawford and William Cruickshank; it was identified as a new element in the next year's red-red flame test color. Strontium was first isolated as a metal in 1808 by Humphry Davy using the then newly discovered process of electrolysis. The production of sugar from beet sugar in the 19th century was the largest application of strontium (see Strontian process). At the peak of television cathode-ray tube production, as much as 75 percent of the strontium consumption in the United States went into faceplate glass. With the move away from the cathode ray tube to other display methods, strontium consumption has dropped dramatically. CHARACTERISTICS Strontium is a divalent silvery metal with a pale yellow color whose properties are largely intermediate between and similar to those of its calcium group neighbors and barium. It is softer than calcium and harder than barium. Its melting (777\u00b0C) and boiling points (1655\u00b0C) points are lower than that of calcium (842\u00b0C and 1757\u00b0C respectively); barium continues this trend decreasing in its melting point (727\u00b0C), but not in its boiling point (2170\u00b0C).",

Three allotropes of metallic strontium exist, with transition points at 235 and 540 \u00b0C. The standard electrode potential for the Sr2+/Sr pair is -2.89 V, about the middle between those of the Ca2+/Ca (-2.84 V) and Ba2+/Ba (-2.92 V) pairs, and close to those of the neighboring alkali metals. Strontium is intermediate between calcium and barium reactivity towards water, with which it reacts on contact to produce strontium hydroxide and hydrogen gas. Metal strontium burns in air to produce both strontium oxide and strontium nitride, but because it does not react with nitrogen below 380 \u00b0C, at room temperature, it forms only the oxide spontaneously. In addition to the simple oxide SrO, peroxide SrO2 can be prepared by the direct oxidation of strontium metal under high oxygen pressure, and there is some evidence for the yellow superoxide Sr(O2)2. Strontium hydroxide, Sr(OH)2, is a strong base, although it is not as strong as hydroxide of barium or alkali metals. Because of the large size of the heavy block elements, including strontium, a wide variety of coordination numbers are known, from 2, 3, or 4 to 22 or 24 in SrCd11 and SrZn13. The large sizes of strontium and barium play an important role in stabilizing strontium complexes with polydentate macrocyclic ligands such as crown ethers: for example, while 18-crown-6 forms relatively weak complexes with calcium and alkali metals, strontium and barium complexes are much stronger. Organostrontium compounds contain one or more strontium-carbon bonds. They have been reported as intermediates in Barbier-type reactions.",

In the past, traders from India who also spread Buddhist and Hindu religions and culture in Indonesia called themselves \"coming from the West (Bharat)\", so the direction of their arrival was called \"west\" by the Malay people. , west, is a Germanic word passed into several Romance languages \u200b\u200b(ouest in French, oest in Catalan, ovest in Italian, oeste in Spanish and Portuguese).

To go west using a compass for navigation (in a place where magnetic north is the same direction as true north) we need to set the bearing or azimuth of 270\u00b0.

In particular, the term usually refers to the process by which life on Earth arose. Abiogenesis is thought to have occurred during the early Eoarchean period, or about 4 to 3.5 billion years ago. Most of the amino acids, which are often dubbed \"the building blocks of life\", were successfully synthesized in the Miller-Urey experiment and in other experiments that simulated early Earth conditions. Other important biochemicals such as nucleotides and saccharides can occur in a similar way. In all organisms, these biochemicals are organized into more complex molecules, such as proteins, polysaccharides, and nucleic acids. The three molecules are essential for the functioning of life and are present in all organisms. The formation of these macromolecules is mediated by nucleic acids and enzymes, which are synthesized through protein-catalyzed biochemical pathways. Which organic molecules appeared first and how they formed the first organisms is still being debated. The first life to appear on Earth is thought to have been single-celled prokaryotes that may have evolved from protobionts (organic molecules surrounded by a membrane-like structure). The oldest recorded microbial fossils date back 3.5 billion years, about a billion years after the formation of Earth. By 2.4 billion years ago, isotope ratios of carbon, iron, and sulfur indicated the influence of life on mineral and inorganic sediments and molecular markers indicated the occurrence of photosynthesis. Modern abiogenesis (which was first coined by Oparin and Haldane in the 1920s) is different from classical abiogenesis, aka spontaneous generation. One of the most basic differences is that modern abiogenesis is an explanation of the origins of life phenomena while classical abiogenesis expressed by Aristotle explains how certain animals/plants (appear) routinely appear without going through reproduction.",

For some plants are produced by plant seeds, while other plants arise independently from the formation of an elemental principle resembling a seed; and plants of this second kind too some absorb nutrients from the soil and some grow inside other plants as described in my treaty on Botany. So there are also animals that are born from a parent animal of the same kind, while others grow spontaneously and not from creatures of the same type.\" and gives an example in the book: \"Eels are not produced through intercourse, nor are they oviparous. Never have any eel caught that has sperm or egg fluids; it has never been found that eels have ducts or oviparous ducts. In fact, all types of living things bleed it is neither produced by intercourse nor by laying eggs. This is absolutely made clear by the following: in certain swamps, after all the water is removed and the mud is drained, the eels reappear after rains.\" Until the 19th century many scientists as well as the ancient Greeks believed that living matter could spontaneously arise from nonliving matter \u2013 a process called spontaneous generation.",

The Third Great Council was held in Pattaliputta (Patna) in the third century after the Buddha's death (249 BC) under Emperor Asoka Wardhana. This emperor embraced Buddhism and with his influence helped spread the Dhamma throughout the empire.

Hierarchically, the Marapu can be divided into two groups, namely Marapu and Marapu Ratu. Marapu are ancestral spirits who are deified and are considered to be the forerunners of a kabihu (extended family, clan), while Marapu Ratu is a marapu who is considered to have descended from the sky and is the ancestor of the other marapu, so it is a marapu who has the highest position.

Hardening of feces can cause an increase in the time and a decrease in the frequency of defecation between discharge or disposal, which is called constipation or constipation. And conversely, if the hardening of feces is disturbed, it causes a decrease in the time and an increase in the frequency of defecation, which is called diarrhea or diarrhea. The characteristic odor of feces is caused by bacterial activity. The bacteria produce compounds such as indole, skatole, and thiols (compounds containing sulfur), as well as hydrogen sulfide gas.

Examples include: Protonation is the process of adding a hydrogen cation (H+ ion) to a compound, generally a nucleophile, because H+ ions are electrophiles. Protonation is a very basic chemical reaction and is a step in many catalytic and stoichiometric processes. Some ions and molecules can undergo more than one protonation and be labeled as polybasic, which is common with many biological macromolecules. Protonation and deprotonation (removal of protons) occur in most acid-base reactions; they are the essence of most theories of acid-base reactions. A Br\u00f8nsted\u2013Lowry acid is defined as a chemical substance that protonates another substance. Upon protonation of the substrate, the mass and charge of the species increase by one unit each, making it an important step in several analytical procedures such as electron burst mass spectrometry. The protonation and deprotonation of a molecule or ion can change many other chemical properties, not just mass and charge, such as changes in their hydrophilicity, reduction potential, and optical properties. Protonation is sometimes fast, partly due to the fast mobility of protons in many solvents. The rate of protonation is closely related to the acidity of the protonating species: protonation by a weak acid is slower than protonation of the same base by a strong acid. The rates of protonation and deprotonation can be very slow when protonation triggers significant structural changes. Protonation is usually reversible, and the structure and binding of the conjugate base usually do not change with respect to protonation. In some cases, however, protonation leads to isomerization, for example a cis-alkene can be converted to a trans-alkene using a certain amount of a catalytic protonating agent. Many enzymes, such as serine hydrolases, operate by mechanisms that involve alternating protonation of substrates.",

Fiqh became the foundation of Sharia through the interpretation (ijtihad) of the Qur'an and Sunnah by scholars and implemented into a fatwa of scholars. Therefore, sharia is considered unchanging and perfect by Muslims, while jurisprudence can be changed at any time. Fiqh is related to the observance of rituals, morals, and social norms in Islam as well as the political system. In the modern era, there are four sects in Sunni, plus two or three sects in Shia. People who master the science of jurisprudence are called faq\u012bh (plural fuqaha). In general, jurisprudence means knowledge of Islamic laws based on its sources. Descending the sources of Islamic law requires the method of ijtihad performed by a mujtahid to obtain a more detailed understanding related to Islamic laws. A faq\u012bh must see and understand deeply all the problems and not be satisfied with the written meaning only, and a person who only understands the law without knowing the essence of the law does not meet the requirements as a faq\u012bh. The study of jurisprudence is generally divided into u\u1e63\u016bl al-fiqh (methods of interpretation and analysis of jurisprudence sources); as well as fur\u016b\u02bf al-fiqh (branches of fiqh with that foundation).

Pantheistic beliefs do not recognize the existence of a specific personal god, whether anthropomorphic or not. However, pantheism is characterized by various doctrines in terms of the relationship between reality and divinity. The concept of pantheistic has existed for thousands of years, and pantheistic elements have been recognized in various religious traditions. The term pantheism was coined by the mathematician Joseph Raphson in 1697, and since then has been used to describe the beliefs of various people and organizations. Pantheism was popularized in Western culture as a theological and philosophical view based on the book by 17th century philosopher Baruch Spinoza, \"Ethics\". The pantheistic attitude was also shared by the philosopher and cosmologist Giordano Bruno in the 16th century. Pantheistic ideas are found in the religions of South and East Asia (especially Sikhism, Hinduism, Sanamahism, Confucianism, and Taoism) and in Sufism (Sufism) within Islam. The term pantheism comes from the Greek words pan (meaning \"all, everything\") and theos (meaning \"god, divine\"). The first known combination of this etymological explanation appears in Latin, in Joseph Raphson's 1697 book, \"De Spatio Reali seu Ente Infinito\". In the book, he refers to the \"pantheism\" views of Spinoza and other thinkers. There are many definitions of pantheism. Some scholars consider it a theological and philosophical position about God. :p.8 Pantheism is the view that everything is part of God who is immanent and includes everything. All forms of reality can then be considered as part of that Being, or identical with Him. Some argue that pantheism is a non-religious philosophical position.",

Pantheistic tendencies were also present in some early Gnostic groups, with pantheistic thought appearing throughout the Middle Ages. Pantheist views were also part of the work of Johannes Scotus Eriugena, De divisione naturae, in the 9th century and mystical beliefs as expressed by Amalric of Bena (11th \u2013 12th century) and Eckhart (12th \u2013 13th century) .:pp. 620\u2013621 The Catholic Church has long considered pantheistic views to be heretical. Giordano Bruno, an Italian monk who propagated the teachings of a transcendent and infinite God, died at a burning stake in 1600 by the Roman Inquisition. Since then, he has been known as a renowned pantheist and martyr of science. In the West, pantheism was formalized as a separate theology and philosophy based on the work of the 17th century philosopher Baruch Spinoza. :p.7 Spinoza was a Dutch philosopher of Portuguese descent who was raised in the Sephardi Jewish community in Amsterdam. He developed highly controversial ideas regarding the authenticity of the Hebrew Bible and the nature of the Divine. As a result, he was expelled from Jewish society at the age of 23, when the local synagogue issued a herem against him. A number of his books were published posthumously, and soon they were included in the Catholic Church's Index of Prohibited Books. The importance of Spinoza's work was only recognized over the years, by laying the groundwork for the 18th century Enlightenment and modern biblical criticism, including modern conceptions of the self and the universe. In his posthumously published Ethics, \"Spinoza wrote the last undisputed masterpiece of the Latin language, and a pure conception of medieval philosophy that ultimately turned against them and destroyed them.\"",

Anaxagoras, like Empedocles, taught that the reality of the universe is derived from many principles. Anaxagoras was a contemporary of Empedocles as well as of early atomist philosophers, such as Leucippus and Democritus. Anaxagoras is known to have authored one book in prose. However, only a few fragments of the first part have survived. Anaxagoras (500-428 BC) was born in the city of Clazomenai, Ionia, Asia Minor, around 500 BC. In 480 BC, Anaxagoras left his hometown and settled in Athens. He lived in Athens for about 50 years. Thus Anaxagoras became the first philosopher to work in Athens, which would later become the center of Greek philosophy. In Athens Anaxagoras befriended Pericles, a well-known politician in Athens. In addition, it is also said that Euripides, the famous playwright of Greek literature, was a student of Anaxagoras. When Pericles was old, his enemies succeeded in slandering Anaxagoras with apostasy and Anaxagoras was threatened with death. It seems that Anaxagoras was slandered because he considered the sun and moon not to be gods but purely material things. With Pericles' help, he was released from prison and fled to the city of Lampsacus. Anaxagoras is said to have died there at the age of 72. Anaxagoras, like Empedocles, stated that the basic principles that make up the universe are not single, but they differ in number. Empedocles stated that there are only 4 substances that are the principles of the universe, while Anaxagoras stated that the number of these principles is infinite. These substances he called \"seeds\" (spermata). According to Anaxagoras, every thing, in fact all the realities in the universe, are composed of a mixture which contains all the seeds in a certain amount.",

For example, if a person sees gold, then he can immediately recognize it as gold, because the dominant seed in the object is the gold seed. However, in reality, in addition to gold seeds, the thing also has copper, silver, iron, etc. seeds. It's just that all those seeds are not dominant so they are not captured by human senses. The argument that Anaxagoras shows is through the human body. In the human body there are various elements, such as flesh, nails, blood, hair, and so on. How can hair and nails grow, when humans do not eat hair or nails? The solution given by Anaxagoras is because in the food there are seeds of hair, nails, meat, and all other elements. If Empedocles states that there are two principles that cause changes from basic substances, namely \"love\" and \"hate\", then Anaxagoras states that there is only one principle that causes changes from those seeds, namely nous. Nous means \"spirit\" or \"ratio\". It is not mixed with the seeds and separated from all things, but becomes the principle that regulates everything. It is still a matter of debate whether the nous he means is material or not, because Anaxagoras said that nous is the most refined and purest element of everything that exists. However, it is clear that Anaxagoras was the first philosopher to establish the independence of spirit or ratio over all substances or matter. Anaxagoras' teaching about the universe is similar to the first philosophers from Ionia, especially Anaximenes. Anaxagoras thinks that the bodies of the universe consist of rocks that glow due to the high speed of the whirlwind that moves them.",

Interpreted utterances mean firm and clear utterances. In interpreting the Koran, there is the way of Ibn Taimiyyah which is quoted by Buya Hamka in his Tafsir al-Azhar. First verse by verse, if in doubt about the meaning of a verse, connect it with other verses. Buya Hamka took the example of Surah Thaha verse 67 and detailed it with Surat al-A'raf verse 116 so that mujmal (or general) verses are detailed with other mufashshal (or detailed) verses. After that, the verse is interpreted with the Sunnah, then with the interpretation of the Companions. If both are not found, then tabiin's opinion is used - and even then it must be filtered first, looking for which one is closest to the Quran and Sunnah. According to Buya Hamka in Tafsir al-Azhar, in interpreting the Koran, the main thing is to be based on the Sunnah, namely all the words (aqwal) and deeds (af'al) of the Prophet and the actions of other people \u2014namely RA's companions \u2014 which were approved by him.

Apart from that, there is also an interpretation with reason, which according to Zamakhsyari scholars there is nothing wrong with interpreting with common sense.

Some commentators argue that interpretation is the science that discusses the Koran al-Karim from the perspective of understanding God's intentions according to human ability. In simpler terms, interpretation is expressed as an explanation of something desired by the word. Interpretation can be divided into three types: Historical interpretation is often also referred to as naql interpretation or ma'tsur interpretation.

Work and heat are 2 examples of processes or mechanisms that can transfer large amounts of energy. The second law of thermodynamics limits the amount of work that can be gained through the heating process\u2014some of it is lost as wasted heat. The maximum amount that can be used for work is called available energy. Systems such as machines and living things need available energy, not just any energy.

There are various forms of energy, but all of these types of energy must meet various conditions such as being able to be converted to other forms of energy, obeying the law of conservation of energy, and causing changes in the object of mass that is subjected to that energy. Common forms of energy include kinetic energy from moving objects, radiant energy from light and electromagnetic radiation, potential energy stored in an object due to its position such as gravitational fields, electric fields or magnetic fields, and heat energy which is composed of microscopic potential and kinetic energy. of the random particle motions.

For example, adding 25 kilowatt-hours (90 megajoules) of energy to an object increases its mass by 1 microgram; if there is a balance that is so sensitive then this increase in mass can be seen. The sun converts nuclear potential energy into other forms of energy; its total mass will change when energy is released around it, especially in the form of radiant energy. Although energy can change form, the law of the conservation of energy states that the total energy of a system changes only when energy is transferred into or out of the system. This means that it is impossible to create or destroy energy. The total energy of a system can be calculated by adding up all forms of energy in the system. Examples of energy transfer and transformation are the generation of electricity, chemical reactions, or raising objects. Living organisms also need available energy to stay alive; humans for example, need energy from food along with oxygen to metabolize it. Civilization needs a supply of energy for various activities; Energy sources such as fossil fuels are an important topic in economics and politics. Earth's climate and ecosystems are also powered by radiant energy obtained from the sun (as well as geothermal energy obtained from within the earth.

The liver is located in the abdominal cavity on the right, just below the diaphragm. The liver is also included as a means of excretion because it helps kidney function by breaking down several toxic compounds and produces ammonia, urea and uric acid by utilizing nitrogen from amino acids. Solving process by a toxic compound called liver detoxification process. The liver lobes are made up of parenchymal cells as well as non-parenchymal cells. Parenchymal cells in the liver, called hepatocytes, occupy about 80% of the volume of the liver and perform the main functions of the liver. As much as 40% of liver cells are in the sinusoidal lobes. Hepatocytes are endodermal cells that are continuously stimulated by mesenchymal tissue during the embryonic period until they develop into parenchymal cells. During this period, there was an increase in albumin mRNA transcription as a stimulant of proliferation and differentiation of endodermal cells into hepatocytes. The lobe lumen is formed from the SEC and is occupied by 3 other types of cells, such as Kupffer cells, Ito cells, intrahepatic lymphocytes such as pit cells. Non-parenchymal cells occupy about 6.5% by volume of the liver and produce a variety of substances that control many of the functions of the hepatocyte. Filtration is a function of the sinusoidal lumen-lobes which separate the hepatocyte surface from the blood, SEC has a very large endocytotic capacity with various ligands such as glycoproteins, immune complexes, transferrin and ceruloplasmin. \"SEC\" also functions as an antigen presenter cell that provides MHC I and MHC II expression for T cells.

Kupffer cells daily interact with materials of gastrointestinal origin containing bacterial solutions, and prevent the activation of the toxic effects of these compounds into the liver. Exposure to high bacterial solutions, especially exposure to LPS, causes Kupffer cells to secrete various cytokines that trigger inflammatory processes and can cause liver injury. Secretions include reactive oxygen species, eicosanoids, nitrogen monoxide, carbon monoxide, TNF-\u03b1, IL-10, as a response from the innate immune system in the primary infection phase. Pit cells are lymphocytes with large granules, like NK cells that live in the liver.

However, under conditions when hepatocyte proliferation is inhibited or delayed, oval cells in the periportal area will experience proliferation and differentiation into mature hepatocytes.

While anti-statism is central to this thinking, it also opposes authority or hierarchical organization in the exercise of its relations with human beings, and so is not limited to state systems. Specifically in the economic, political and administrative sectors, anarchy means coordination and management, without bureaucratic rule which is broadly defined as the superior party in the economic, political and administrative realm (both in the public and private spheres).

The boiling and melting points of this gas are the lowest among all the elements. Helium exists only as a gas except under very extreme conditions. Extreme conditions are also required to create small amounts of helium compounds, all of which are unstable at standard temperature and pressure. Helium has a second rare stable isotope called helium-3. Properties of helium-4 variety fluids; helium I and helium II; is important for researchers studying quantum mechanics (particularly in the phenomenon of superfluidity) and for those looking for the effects of the near absolute zero temperature that matter has (such as superconductivity). Helium is the second most abundant and second lightest element in the universe, accounting for 24% of the total elemental mass of the universe and 12 times the total mass of the other heavy elements. The same abundance of helium can also be found on the Sun and Jupiter. This is due to the high nuclear binding energy (per nucleon) of helium-4 compared to the other three chemical elements after helium. The binding energy of helium-4 is also responsible for the abundance of helium-4 as a product of nuclear fusion and radioactive decay. Most of the helium in the universe is helium-4, which is believed to have been formed during the Big Bang. Some new helium is also formed through the nuclear fusion of hydrogen in the cosmic stars. The name \"helium\" comes from the name of the Greek sun god Helios. In 1868, the French astronomer Pierre Jules C\u00e9sar Janssen first detected helium as a hint of unknown yellow spectral lines coming from the light of a solar eclipse.",

In 1903, large deposits of helium were discovered in natural gas fields in the United States, which until now were the largest sources of helium gas. Helium is used in cryogenics, deep-sea breathing systems, cooling superconducting magnets, \"helium dating\", inflating balloons, lifting airships and as a shielding gas for industrial uses (such as \"arc welding\") and growing silicon wafers). Inhaling small amounts of this gas will cause a temporary change in the quality of a person's voice. On Earth, this gas is quite rare (0.00052% by volume of the atmosphere). Most of the helium that we find on Earth is formed from the radioactive decay of the heavy elements (thorium and uranium) as alpha particles with helium-4 nuclei. This radiogenic helium is trapped in natural gas at a concentration as high as 7% by volume, from which it can be extracted commercially using a low temperature separation process called fractional distillation. Evidence for the presence of helium was first observed on August 18, 1868 in the form of a bright yellow spectral line with a wavelength of 587.49 nanometers originating from the spectrum of the Sun's chromosphere. This spectral line was detected by the French astronomer Jules Janssen during a total solar eclipse in Guntur, India. This spectral line was first assumed to be sodium. On 20 October of the same year, British astronomer Norman Lockyer also observed the same yellow line in the solar spectrum, which he later named the Fraunhofer line D3 because it is adjacent to the known sodium lines D1 and D2. He concluded that the existence of these lines was caused by an element in the Sun that was unknown on Earth.",

The severity of corruption varies, from the lightest in the form of using influence and support to give and receive help, to serious corruption that is formalized, and so on. The tipping point of corruption is kleptocracy, which literally means government by thieves, where there is no pretense of being honest. Corruption that appears in the political and bureaucratic fields can be trivial or serious, organized or not. While corruption often facilitates criminal activities such as drug trafficking, money laundering, and prostitution, it is not limited to these areas. In order to study this problem and make a solution, it is very important to distinguish between corruption and crime.

Being grateful and being sincere is one way to make life feel calmer and happier. Various approaches to philosophy, religion, psychology, and biology have been used to define happiness and determine its sources. Philosophers and religious thinkers have often defined happiness in terms of a good life and not simply as an emotion. This definition was used to translate eudaimonia (Greek: \u03b5\u1f50\u03b4\u03b1\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) and is still used in goodness theory. Although direct measurement of happiness levels remains a challenge, several researchers have developed tools to do so, for example with The Oxford Happiness Questionnaire. Researchers have also identified several factors related to happiness: social relationships and interactions, marital status, employment, health, democratic freedoms, optimism, religious involvement, income, receiving gifts and closeness to other happy people. Happiness has many different definitions and is subject to debate in its meaning and usage. This word is widely used in relation to two factors, namely: influencing feelings and emotions, such as pleasure or excitement, and an assessment of the quality of life. In its use can include both of these factors. Assessment of well-being can include what is being felt at the moment (emotions, moods, satisfaction with life and feelings). A female professor named Sonja Lyubomirsky has described happiness as a positive experience, joy, contentment, or state, combined with feelings that one's life is good, meaningful and valuable.

It is difficult to be satisfied with everyday life when constantly looking at it through a hard lens other people's pages. Comparisons that foster dissatisfaction always look at those who have more and achieve higher levels of success (upward social comparison) but seldom compare with those who may not have or do as much (downward social comparison).

After being redefined in 2019, the definition of the second unit, as stated in the ninth edition of the SI Brochure, is as follows. The second, symbolized by s, is the SI unit of time. This unit is defined by obtaining a fixed numerical value from the cesium frequency \u2206\u03bdCs, the hyperfine transition frequency in the ground state of non-perturbating cesium-133 atoms, which is 9,192,631,770 when expressed in Hz units that are proportional to s\u22121. In most common usage, a second is 1/60 of a minute, and 1/3600 of an hour. At first, the term second (second) in English was known as second minute (second minute), which means a small part of one hour. The first part is known as the prime minute, which is the same as the minute as it is known today. The magnitude of this division is fixed at 1/60, that is, there are 60 minutes in an hour and 60 seconds in a minute. This may be due to the influence of the Babylonians, who used a system of calculations based on Sexagesimal (base 60).

Rather it is the epoch of the tropical year which contains 31,556,925.9747 seconds of Ephemeris Time. Ephemeris Time (ET) has been defined as a measure of time that gives the apparent position of a celestial object according to Newton's theory of dynamical motion. With the creation of atomic clocks, the use of atomic clocks was determined as the basis for defining seconds, no longer with the rotation of the earth. As a result of several years' work, two astronomers at the United States Naval Observatory (USNO) and two astronomers at the National Physical Laboratory (Teddington, England) determined the relationship of the hyperfine transition frequency of the cesium atom and the ephemeris second. Using a common-view measurement method based on signals received from radio station WWV, they determined the orbital motion of the moon around the earth, from which the apparent motion of the sun can be inferred, in atomic hour units of time. As a result, in 1967, the General Conference on Weights and Measures defined the second of atomic time in the International System of Units (SI) as the ground state defined in the absence (zero) of the magnetic field. The defined second is the ephemeris second. The definition of second was further refined at the BIPM meeting to include the sentence.

Cells are capable of carrying out all life activities and most of the chemical reactions to sustain life take place within cells. Most living things are composed of a single cell, or are called unicellular organisms, such as bacteria and amoeba. Other living things, including plants, animals and humans, are multicellular organisms consisting of many specialized cell types with different functions. The human body, for example, is composed of more than 1013 cells. However, the whole body of all organisms originates as a result of the division of a single cell. For example, the body of a bacterium originates from the division of its parent bacterial cell, while the body of a mouse originates from the division of its fertilized parent egg. The cells in a multicellular organism would not last long if each were to stand alone. Similar cells are grouped into tissues, which form organs and then organ systems that make up the body of the organism. For example, cardiac muscle cells form cardiac muscle tissue in the heart organ, which is part of the circulatory organ system in the human body. Meanwhile, the cell itself is composed of components called organelles. The smallest cell known to man is the Mycoplasma bacterium with a diameter of 0.0001 to 0.001 mm, while one of the single cells that can be seen with the naked eye is an unfertilized chicken egg. However, most cells are between 1 and 100 \u00b5m (0.001\u20130.1 mm) in diameter and can only be seen with a microscope.

Until the mid-17th century, microscopes had the ability to magnify images up to 30 times. British scientist Robert Hooke then designed a compound microscope that had its own light source making it easier to use. He examined thin slices of cork through a microscope and described the microscopic structure of cork as \"porous like a honeycomb but irregular pores\" in a paper published in 1665. Hooke called the pores cells because they resemble cells (chambers). minor) in a monastery or prison. What Hooke actually saw were the empty cell walls surrounding the dead cells in the cork that came from the bark of an oak tree. He also observed that in green plants there are cells filled with fluid.

According to the Buddhist tradition all things or phenomena that exist in existence other than Nirvana are ruled by three general characteristics, namely: impermanence, suffering, and selflessness (or non-self). Because of this, the longing for or attachment to something -both outwardly and psychologically (or ideologically) - will eventually show up and bring misery. In the Mahayana school, these characteristics are often called Dharma Seals, while in the Theravada tradition they are called Tilakkhana or the Three General Patterns (or the Three Noble Truths; or often known as the Three Patterns of Life). In Buddhist philosophy, the Buddha concluded that everything in the physical world (Pali: Rupa) plus all the phenomena of the soul (Pali: Nama) is characterized by these 3 general characteristics. All visible and invisible forms and views are an assembly of \" Nama-Rupa\" (physio-psycho phenomenology). The existence of this \"Nam-Rupa\" realm is a result of perceptual absorption (Pali: sa\u00f1\u00f1a) which in turn is brought about by conditioning (Pali: sankhara). Conditioning in turn is the need to make clarity in ignorance, while ignorance (Pali: Avija) itself results from birth or re-existence. Since all things in the last instance are based on perception, all things contain these Three General Features because their basis is conditioning which originates in ignorance.

All phenomena (things and experiences) are fickle, unsteady, and impermanent. Everything we can experience through our mind is made up of components, and depends on the right side of the conditions for its existence. Everything is in continuous change without ceasing, and thus conditions and things are constantly changing. Things are constantly standing; gets, and stops for; Becomes. There's nothing that doesn't end. The important value here is that the symptoms arise and stop according to complex conditions and not according to our attitude and imagination. As long as we have limited our ability to effect change to our environment and attachments, experience tells us that our weak effort is no guarantee that the results of our efforts will be to our liking. More often than not that, the results we get are lower than the results we expect. In the Mahayana tradition, an emphasis is added: one should constantly meditate on the impermanence and transitory nature of structures and phenomena, but one must be on guard against extending this understanding to the realm of Nirvana, where impermanence has no effect. In such a view, the true nature of reality becomes free from the taint of double-mindedness, and is therefore not labeled as 'the one' or 'the other' (i.e. 'eternal' or 'impermanent'). Dzongsar Jamyang Khyentse Rinpoche insists in the four seals of the Mahayana tradition, Nirvana must be seen as \"beyond ardor\".

This can be a simple redox process such as the oxidation of carbon to give carbon dioxide, or the reduction of carbon by hydrogen to give methane (CH4), or it can be a complex process such as the oxidation of sugar in the human body through a complicated sequence of electron transfers. The term redox comes from two concepts, namely reduction and oxidation. It can be explained easily as follows: While it is quite appropriate for use in many purposes, the above explanation is not exactly correct. Oxidation and reduction precisely refer to changes in oxidation number because the actual transfer of electrons will not always occur. So oxidation is better defined as an increase in oxidation number, and reduction as a decrease in oxidation number. In practice, the transfer of electrons will always change oxidation number, but there are many reactions that are classified as \"redox\" even though there is no transfer of electrons in the reaction (eg those involving covalent bonds). Non-redox reactions that do not involve a change in formal charge are known as metathesis reactions.

The oxidizing agent removes electrons from other compounds, thereby reducing itself. Because it \"accepts\" electrons, it is also known as an electron acceptor. Oxidizing agents are usually compounds that have elements with a high oxidation number (such as H, MnO, CrO3, Cr, OsO4) or compounds that are highly electronegative, so they can gain one or two more electrons by oxidizing a compound ( such as oxygen, fluorine, chlorine, and bromine).",

The reducing agent gives up its electrons to another compound, so that it itself is oxidized. Because it \"donates\" electrons, it is also called an electron donor. Compounds that are reducing agents vary widely. Metal elements such as Li, Na, Mg, Fe, Zn, and Al can be used as reducing agents. These metals will give their electrons easily. Another type of reducing agent is the hydride transfer reagents, eg NaBH4 and LiAlH4), these reagents are used widely in organic chemistry, especially in the reduction of carbonyl compounds to alcohols. Another useful reduction method involves gaseous hydrogen (H2) over a palladium, platinum, or nickel catalyst. This catalytic reduction is primarily used in the reduction of carbon-carbon double or triple bonds. An easy way to look at redox processes is, the reducing agent transfers its electrons to the oxidizing agent. So in a reaction, the reducing agent loses electrons and is oxidized, and the oxidizing agent gains electrons and is reduced. The oxidizing and reducing pairs involved in a reaction are known as redox pairs. One example of a redox reaction is that between hydrogen and fluorine: We can write this whole reaction as two half reactions: an oxidation reaction and a reduction reaction. Analyzing each half reaction will make the overall chemical process clearer. Since there is no change in total charge during a redox reaction, the number of electrons in excess in the oxidation reaction must equal the number consumed in the reduction reaction. Elements, even in molecular form, often have an oxidation number of zero. In the above reaction, hydrogen is oxidized from an oxidation state of 0 to +1, while fluorine is reduced from an oxidation state of 0 to -1. When oxidation and reduction reactions are combined, the electrons involved reduce each other: And the ions combine to form hydrogen fluoride: Redox occurs in a single replacement reaction or substitution reaction.",

Bahrain is in a group of islands between the Qatar Peninsula and the northeast coast of Saudi Arabia. Bahrain is an island country located off the west coast of the Persian Gulf in the Middle East. Bahrain is a small archipelago centered on Bahrain Island, which is Bahrain's largest island. The country is only about 23 km (14 mi) east of Saudi Arabia, which is connected by the King Fahd Bridge. The Qatar peninsula is also relatively close, only about 50 km (31 mi) southeast of the Gulf of Bahrain. Iran is 200 km (124 mi) north across the Persian Gulf. The population in 2010 was 1,234,567, including 666,172 foreign nationals. The country's area reaches 780\u00a0km2 In size, Bahrain is the third smallest country in Asia after the Maldives and Singapore. Bahrain is the site of ancient Dilmun. Bahrain has been famous since ancient times for its pearl fishing, which continued into the 19th century. Bahrain is one of the regions that first embraced Islam (ad 628). According to Arab stories, Bahrain was ruled by the Portuguese in 1521, which was recaptured in 1602 by Shah Abbas I of the Safavi Empire under the Persian Empire. In 1783, the Bani Utbah controlled Bahrain from Nasr Al-Madhkur and were continued by the Al Khalifa Family, with Ahmed al Fateh as the first judge of Bahrain. In the late 1800s by successive treaties with the United Kingdom, Bahrain became a British protected area. In 1971, Bahrain declared its independence.

Bahrain has a high level of Human Development Index and is recognized by the World Bank as a high-income country. Its area is almost equivalent to the area of \u200b\u200bDKI Jakarta. Bahrain has been occupied by humans since pre-historic times. Its strategic location on the Persian Gulf has influenced the Assyrians, Babylonians, Greeks, Persians, and most recently the Arabs (the inhabitants of which later became Muslim). Bahrain in ancient times was known as Dilmun, Tylos (the Greek name), Awal, even Mishmahig when under the rule of the Persian Sultanate. The islands of Bahrain which are located in the south center of the Persian Gulf have attracted invaders throughout history. Bahrain in Arabic means \"Two Seas\". This refers to the fact that this island has two different sources of water, fresh water that emerges from the ground and salt water that surrounds it. As a strategic island that lies between East and West, fertile soil, and abundant fresh water, and a place for divers looking for pearls have made Bahrain the center of the longest settlement. For 2300 years, Bahrain was the center of world trade between Mesopotamia (now Iraq) and the Indus Valley (now a region of India). It is the Delmon civilization that has close ties to the Sumerian Civilization in the 3rd century BC. Bahrain became part of Babylon around 600 BC.

Rope has tensile strength so it can be used for dragging and lifting, but is too flexible to provide compressive strength. Rope is thicker and stronger than similarly constructed cables, lines, ropes, and threads. Rope can be constructed from any length, thread, fibrous material, but is generally made from natural fibers or certain synthetic fibers. Synthetic fiber ropes are significantly stronger than their natural fiber counterparts, but they also have certain disadvantages, including slippage. Common natural fibers for manila rope are hemp, linen, cotton, coir, straw, and sisal. Synthetic fibers used for rope manufacture include polypropylene, nylon, polyester (eg PET, LCP, HDPE, Vectran), polyethylene (eg Dyneema and Spectra), aramid (eg Twaron, Technora and Kevlar) and acrylics (eg Dralon). Some ropes are made from a mixture of several fibers or use co-polymer fibers. The rope can also be made of metal. Ropes have been constructed from other fibrous materials such as silk, wool, and hair, but they are not generally available. Rayon is a regenerated fiber used to make decorative ropes. Rope activity has been introduced for centuries. Ropes are usually used for various kinds of daily needs, such as for pulling, lifting, climbing, hunting and so on. As far back as 4000 BC, the ancient Egyptians were making rope from animal hair, grass or leather. Meanwhile, the Chinese themselves began to make rope from hemp fiber. The manufacture of rope then spread to Asia and Europe. In the late 1700s, rope making was already using a machine.",

A century later, Isaac Newton devised a method for calculating the orbit of a comet based on its observable path in space. Newton determined that the comet that appeared in December 1680 followed a very elongated parabolic orbit. Edmond Halley, a scientist who lived a contemporary of Newton, found that the orbits of the comets that had appeared in 1531, 1607, and 1682 were nearly identical. This discovery led to the conclusion that the three sightings involved the same comet. He then predicted that the comet would appear again in 1758. Unfortunately, he was not old enough to be able to witness the truth of his prediction. The sighting of this comet-which was later named Halley's comet-in fact has been recorded 20 times since 239 BC. Its last appearance was in 1985-1986. Newly discovered comets are usually named according to the year they were discovered plus a letter indicating the order in which the comet appeared in the year it was discovered.

The term peat itself is absorbed from the regional language of Banjar. As an organic material, peat can be used as an energy source. The volume of peat worldwide is estimated at 4 trillion m\u00b3, which covers an area of \u200b\u200bapproximately 3 million km\u00b2 or about 2% of the world's land area, and contains an energy potential of approximately 8 billion terajoules.

About 60% of the world's wetlands are peat; and about 7% of those peatlands have been cleared and utilized for agricultural and forestry purposes. When conditions are right, peat can turn into a type of coal over a period of geological time.

Soil with an organic matter content between 35\u201365% is also commonly called muck. The addition of peat layers and the degree of decomposition (humification) mainly depend on the composition of the peat and the intensity of inundation. Peat that forms in very wet conditions decomposes less, and thus accumulates relatively quickly, compared to peat that forms on drier lands. These properties allow climatologists to use peat as an indicator of climate change in the past. Likewise, through an analysis of the composition of peat, especially the type and amount of organic matter constituents, archaeologists can reconstruct an ecological picture of ancient times. Under the right conditions, peat is also an early stage of coal formation. Recent bog peat, formed in the high latitudes at the end of the last Ice Age, about 9,000 years ago. This peat is still growing in thickness at a rate of about a few millimeters a year. But the world's peat is believed to have begun to form no less than 360 million years ago; and now stores about 550 Gt of carbon. Peat is soft and easy to press.

Cross-breeding between chicken breeds has produced hundreds of superior lines or pure lines with various functions; the most common are broiler chickens (to be cut) and laying hens (to take the eggs). The common chicken can also be crossed with its close relative, the green jungle fowl, which produces a barren hybrid whose male is known as the bekisar chicken. Chicken supplies two sources of protein in food: chicken meat and eggs. The traditional view of poultry farming on the domestication of this species is set out in the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (2007): \"Humans first domesticated chickens of Indian origin for cockfighting purposes in Asia, Africa and Europe. No special attention was paid to egg or meat production.

Canonical Bibles vary depending on tradition or group; a number of Bible canons have evolved, with overlapping and divergent content. The Christian Old Testament overlaps with the Hebrew Bible and Greek Septuagint; The Hebrew Bible is known in Judaism as the Tanakh. The New Testament is a collection of writings by early Christians, believed to be many of them disciples of Jesus Christ, written in first-century Koine Greek. These early Christian Greek writings consist of various narratives, letters, and apocalyptic writings. Among Christian denominations there is some difference of opinion regarding the content of the canon, especially in the Apocrypha, that is, a number of works which are viewed with varying degrees of reverence. Different Christian circles approach the Bible differently. Roman Catholic, Anglican, and Eastern Orthodox Christians emphasize the harmony and importance of the Bible and sacred tradition, while Protestant Christians focus on the concept of sola scriptura, or just the Bible. This concept arose during the Protestant Reformation, and many Protestant denominations continue to support the use of the Bible as the sole source of Christian teaching to this day. With an estimated total sales of over 5 billion copies, the Bible is widely considered the best-selling book of all time. It is estimated that its annual sales are 100 million copies, and it has had a major impact on literature and history, especially in the Western world.",

Due to its high value as a spice, nutmeg fruit and seeds have been important trade commodities since Roman times. Nutmeg is mentioned in Pliny's encyclopedia \"The Old One\". Since the time of European exploration, nutmeg has spread widely in other tropical regions such as Mauritius and the Caribbean (Grenada). The term nutmeg is also used for traded nutmeg. This plant has two houses (dioecious) so that it is known as male and female trees. The leaves are slender elliptical. The fruit is oval in shape like a lemon, yellow in color, fleshy and has a distinctive aroma because it contains essential oils in the flesh. When ripe, the skin and flesh of the fruit open and the seeds will appear wrapped in red mace. One fruit produces one brown seed. Utilization of nutmeg can be in the form of seeds, coated seeds (arillus), and fruit flesh. In trade, coated nutmeg is called mace, or in English it is called mace, in pharmaceutical terms it is called myristicae arillus or macis). The flesh of the nutmeg is called myristicae fructus cortex. The nutmeg plant is a plant that takes a long time to grow until it is harvested. The first harvest takes place 7 to 9 years after the trees are planted and reaches maximum production capacity after 25 years. The growth can reach 20m and its age can reach hundreds of years. Before being marketed, the seeds are dried in the sun to dry after being separated from the mace. This drying takes six to eight weeks. The inside of the bean will shrink in this process and you will hear a sound when the bean is shaken. The seed shell will crack and the inside of the seed is sold as nutmeg. Nutmeg contains 7-14% essential oil. Nutmeg powder is used as a flavoring for bread or cakes, puddings, sauces, vegetables, and refreshing drinks (such as eggnog).",

Nutmeg plants in general can grow in areas with an altitude of around 0-700 meters above sea level with a relatively high need for rainfall, namely 2000-3500 mm/year and humidity of around 50-80%. This plant can usually grow to a tree height of 5-15 meters or can even reach 30 meters. Nutmeg is suitable for growing at temperatures around 20-30oC with the soil structure where it grows has a fairly large range, from dense to sandy soil and has an acidity degree of 5.5 \u2013 7. In nurseries, nutmeg plants are usually watered every 1-2 times a day. if there is no rain at all accompanied by weeding of the surrounding weeds and also soil loosening treatment. Plant fertilizers such as manure, compost, or inorganic fertilizers such as urea are also added every 3 months. Harvesting nutmeg can be done 3 times a year, namely at the beginning of the rainy season which gives the best quality nutmeg yields, then in the middle of the rainy season when the number of ready-to-harvest nutmeg is usually the highest among other periods, then the amount of nutmeg ready for harvest decreases and can be harvested at the end of the rainy season. Nutmeg plants are spread in regions or countries that have tropical climates including Guangdong and Yunnan in China, Taiwan, Malaysia, Grenada in the Caribbean Islands, Kerala in India, Sri Lanka and South Africa, especially also in their country of origin, namely Indonesia.",

He was crowned Imperator Augustus in Rome on Christmas Day 800 by Pope Leo III, and is therefore considered to be the founder of the Holy Roman Empire (under the title Charles I). The achievements and progress he created have made him considered the founding father of France and Germany and even the founding father of Europe. Through a series of wars and conquests, he expanded his realm to include most of Western Europe. In fact, he was the first emperor in the West since the collapse of the Roman Empire. The name Karolus is taken from the name of his grandfather, Karl Martell, a warrior who repelled Muslim troops from French territory. In English and French, he is known as Charles. Meanwhile, he is also known as Carolus in Latin.

With the existence of unity, wars became rare and the people under the reign of Charles I could focus on other things such as education, culture, religion and finances. When he began his reign in 768, Charles co-reigned with his younger brother Charles. Charles got the western and northern territories bordering the Atlantic ocean, and Karloman got the eastern and southern territories. However, they do not get along with one another. Their tensions led to fears of war breaking out between them, which only ended with Charles' death on December 4, 771. In 771, after Charles had inherited his younger brother's territories, he began three decades of subjection. He pushed the borders of his kingdom eastward and eventually he ruled Burgundy, most of Italy, Alamania, Bavaria and Thuringia. In the north he controlled Saxony and Frisia. To the east of the two areas, he created areas with special military organizations called markers. These areas stretch from the Baltic Sea to the Adriatic. For the first time, most of Europe enjoyed stable leadership. Until Christmas 800, Charles held the title of king of the Franks. On that holy day, Pope Leo III crowned him emperor of the Holy Roman empire, and once again it appeared that Western Europe had an emperor who followed in the footsteps of Constantine the Great. From then on he became known as Carolus Magnus, \"Carol the Great\".

Due to his philosophical views which rejected Greek religion, Prodikos had to deal with the local government in Athens. Prodikos adheres to a pessimistic view of life. Death is seen as a way to escape from the hardships of human life. The fear of death is contrary to human common sense. According to Prodikos, religion is a human invention.

It is a silvery-white radioactive metal included in the actinide series in the periodic table. Uranium has 92 protons and 92 electrons, with 6 valence electrons. The uranium nucleus binds 141 to 146 neutrons, so there are 6 uranium isotopes. The most common isotopes are uranium-238 (146 neutrons) and uranium-235 (143 neutrons). All uranium isotopes are unstable and weakly radioactive. Uranium has the second heaviest atomic weight (after plutonium) of all the chemical elements that can be found naturally. Uranium is about 70% more dense than lead, but it is not as dense as gold or tungsten. Uranium can be found naturally in low concentrations (a few parts per million (ppm)) in soil, rocks, and water. Uranium that can be found naturally is uranium-238 (99.2739\u201399.2752%), uranium-235 (0.7198\u20130.7202%), and traces of uranium-234 (0.0050\u20130.0059%) . Uranium decays slowly by emitting alpha particles. The half-life of uranium-238 is about 4.47 billion years, while that of uranium-235 is 704 million years.

In general phosphorus forms a white, sticky solid which has an unpleasant odor but when pure is colorless and transparent. This nonmetal is insoluble in water, but soluble in carbon disulfide. Pure phosphorus ignites spontaneously in air to form phosphorus pentoxide. Phosphorus can exist in four or more allotropic forms: white (or yellow), red, and black (or purple). The most common are red and white phosphorus, both grouped into four atoms in a tetrahedral shape. White phosphorus burns when in contact with air and can turn red phosphorus when exposed to heat or light. White phosphorus can also exist in alpha and beta states separated by a transition temperature of -3.8\u00b0C.

Because of that it can become material for study by academics, documentation of the peculiarities of certain societies, or documentation and imaginative thinking in the future. Since 1977, 18 May has been celebrated as International Museum Day. The existence of a museum is very important because it has the responsibility and function to preserve, foster, as well as develop community culture, both tangible and intangible. Through messages that are arranged through displays and exhibition spaces, museums in Indonesia function as a means of communication and bridges that can trigger awareness and knowledge in society. The existence of museums in Indonesia is very important considering that museums do not only have a function as a protector of cultural heritage objects, but also as a place for forming ideology, discipline, and developing knowledge for the public. This is also confirmed in the ICOM code of ethics, \u201cMuseums have an important task of developing an educational role and attracting wider audiences from the community, locality, or group it serves. Interaction with the supporting community and the guidance and promotion of the heritage it supports is an integral part of the education that must be carried out by museums. Etymologically, the museum comes from the Greek word, \u039c\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bf\u03bd or mouseion, which actually refers to the name of the temple for the nine goddess Muses, the children of Zeus who symbolize science and art. Another building that is known to be related to the history of the museum is part of the library complex built specifically for arts and sciences, especially philosophy and research in Alexandria by Ptolemy I Soter in 280 BC.",

In Indonesia, the first museum built was the Radya Pustaka Museum. Apart from that, it is also known as the Elephant Museum which is known as the most complete collection in Indonesia, the Puppet Museum, Persada Soekarno, the Textile Museum and the Indonesian National Gallery which specifically presents collections of Indonesian modern art. Initially, museums began as places to store collections belonging to wealthy individuals, families or institutions. The objects kept are usually works of art and rare objects, or collections of natural objects and archaeological artefacts. There are several museums in the world, including: Museums vary in type, from large institutions covering many categories, to small institutions that focus on a particular subject, location, or person. In addition there are universal museums whose collections represent the world and usually collections include art, science, history and natural history. The type and size of the museum is reflected in the collection. A museum usually has a core collection which is the most important object in its field. The categories of these museums include: Archaeological museum is a museum that specializes in displaying archaeological artifacts. Many archaeological museums are open museums (open air museums). In Indonesia, an example of an archaeological museum is the Trowulan Museum in Trowulan, East Java. An art museum, better known as an art gallery, is a room for exhibitions of art objects, ranging from the visual arts, including paintings, drawings and sculptures. Some other examples are ceramic art, metal art and furniture. An example of this art museum in Europe is the Merbach-Cabinet in Basel, which was originally a private collection sold to the Basel city government in 1661, and became a public museum from 1671.",

But many other terms are also used, such as: mantrayana, secret mantra teaching, esoteric Buddhism. Vajrayana is a teaching that developed from Mahayana Buddhism, and differs in practice, not philosophy. In Vajrayana teachings, meditation practice is often preceded by a short mantra recitation and visualization. The term \"Vajrayana\" comes from the word vajra which in Sanskrit means 'thunder' or 'diamond'. Vajra symbolizes diamond as the hardest element on Earth, so the term Vajrayana can mean \"Indestructible and changeless Vehicle\". The philosophy of Buddhism can be divided into two: Hinayana/Pratimokshayana (one of which is Theravada) and Mahayana. Hinayana emphasizes attainment as an Arahant, whereas Mahayana emphasizes attainment as a Bodhisattva. Tantrayana which is part of Mahayana is also often known by the name of the Bodhisattva path. Hinayana can be divided into Vaibhashika and Sautrantika. Whereas Mahayana is divided into Cittamatra and Madhyamika. This Madhyamaka consists of Rangtong (which includes Sautrantika and Prasangika) and Shentong (Yogacara-Madhyamaka). These four Buddhist philosophies (Vaibhasika, Sautrantika, Cittamatra, and Madhyamika) have existed since the time of Gautama Buddha, arising from the different beliefs, different levels of understanding, different attainments, and realizations of the Buddha's disciples. Vaibhasika and Sautrantika teachings are widely found in Thailand, Burma, Sri Lanka and Cambodia. This Cittamatra teaching can be found in China, Taiwan, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Tibet and its surroundings.

In several countries (especially in Asia), there are many assumptions that Vajrayana is a mystical teaching, full of occult. This is actually not true. In Vajrayana, there are many methods of practice. Indeed, there are many Vajrayana practitioners who have extraordinary abilities, but this is not something mystical. This is actually a by-product of the practice, and it should be ignored. As the Buddha said, what can save us at the time of death is the Dharma, not the powers we have.

This phase began around the 10th millennium BC. Humans are thought to have started to really switch to a sedentary lifestyle, around 8000 BC, at which time, the ice age had completely melted away. This makes the soil more fertile, so it can be used for farming. The first towns were built, for example Jericho, which at this time grew into a 10 hectare village. Jericho is the first city with houses built of clay, and also the first city with the oldest known evidence of city defense (the evidence being watchtowers). In the Middle East, goats were raised, and wheat was planted. Due to the melting of all the ice, the sea level rose, so the land bridges in Siberia were closed. This isolated immigrants from Siberia. The end time of this age varies, depending on the region. Some isolated tribes are still experiencing the Neolithic era, even today. The Neolithic or New Stone Age began when humans started sharpening and polishing some of their stone tools after chipping them. The New Stone Age began less than ten thousand years ago. Maps of Europe in this period show outlines much the same as maps today. Great Britain and Ireland are currently separated from the European continent by the shallow waters of the North Sea, English Channel and Irish Sea. Due to the sinking of the Mediterranean region, Spain and Italy are no longer connected to North Africa by a land bridge. The plants that thrived in the colder paleolithic epoch made room for temperate animals, and vast forests began to cover what had previously been treeless prairies. Woolly rhinoceros, woolly mammoths, and cave bears became extinct; sheep and wildebeest fled to the Arctic latitudes, while hippos, elephants and other large mammals found their way to the tropics.",

Catholicos, the title of supreme leader in a number of Eastern Churches, also comes from the same root. This term is already attached to the name of the largest Christian community in the world, namely the Catholic Church. The three main branches of Christianity in the East, namely the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Oriental Orthodox Church and the Persian Church, have always called themselves Catholic, according to the apostolic tradition and the Nicene Creed. Anglican, Lutheran, and some Methodist congregations believe that their churches are also \"Catholic\", in the sense of being a continuation of the First worldwide Church founded by Christ's apostles. Nevertheless, each Church interprets the term \"Catholic Church\" differently. For example, both the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Oriental Orthodox Church and the Persian Church assert that their denominations are continuations of the worldwide Primal Church, while all other denominations are mere fragments of it. The beliefs that characterize Catholicism, namely the beliefs of the majority of Christians who call themselves \"Catholics\", include episcopalism, namely glorifying bishops as the highest clergy in Christianity, and acceptance of the Nicene Creed in 381.",

Before the East-West Schism of 1054, these two terms only meant different areas, because there was only one Catholicism, which included both Latin-speaking Christians in the West and Greek-speaking Christians in the East. After the East-West Schism, the meaning of these terms became more complicated, and gave rise to several parallel but contradictory grammars. The forerunner to the term catholic is the word katolikos, the Greek adjective meaning \"universe\". Directly from the original language, or via Late Latin, the term catholic entered many other languages, and became the basis for the formation of various theological terms such as catholicism (Late Latin: catholicismus) and catholicism (Late Latin: catholicitas). The term \"catholicism\" is an abstract noun formed from the adjective \"catholic\". Its Modern Greek equivalent is \u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2 (katolikismos), which usually refers to the Catholic Church. The terms \"catholic\", \"catholicism\" and \"catholicity\" are closely related to the use of the term \"Catholic Church\". The oldest evidence of the use of this term is the Epistle to the Smyrna of Saint Ignatius, Bishop of Antioch, written around 108 and addressed to Christians in the city of Smyrna. In this letter, Saint Ignatius urges Christians to remain closely united with their bishop, in a sentence that reads \"it would be good if wherever the bishop was present, the congregation was also present, so that just as wherever Jesus Christ was present, the Church was present too.

MOSFETs include channels of N-type and P-type semiconductor materials, and are called NMOSFETs or PMOSFETs (also commonly nMOS, pMOS). It is the most common transistor in both digital and analog circuits, but the bipolar junction transistor was at one time more common. MOSFETs were invented by Mohamed M. Atalla and Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs in 1959, and were first introduced in June 1960. These devices are the foundational building blocks of modern electronics, and are the most widely produced electronic devices in history, with a number of approx. approximately 13 sextillion (1.3\u00d71022) MOSFETs were produced between 1960 and 2018. MOSFETs are the dominant semiconductor devices in digital or analog integrated circuits (ICs), and are common power devices. MOSFETs are miniaturized and mass-produced solid state transistors for various forms of applications, revolutionizing the electronics industry and world economy, and critical to the digital revolution, the silicon age and the information age. The miniaturization of MOSFETs has driven the rapid development of electronic semiconductor technology since the 1960s, and made possible high-density ICs such as memory chips and microprocessors. The word 'metal' in the current name is actually a misnomer because the former metal-oxide layer of the gate material has now often been replaced with a layer of polysilicon (polycrystalline silicon). Previously aluminum was used as a gate material until the 1980s when polysilicon began to dominate with its ability to form self-adjusting gates. However, metal gates are now being used again because it is difficult to increase the operating speed of transistors without metal gates. An IGFET is a related device, a more general term meaning an isolated-gate field-effect transistor, and is nearly identical to a MOSFET, although it can refer to any FET with a non-oxide gate insulator.",

The basic principle of the field-effect transistor (FET) was first proposed by the Austrian-Hungarian physicist Julius Edgar Lilienfeld in 1926, when he was filling out the first patent for an isolated-gate field-effect transistor (IGFET). Over the next two years he explained various FET structures. In the MOS configuration aluminum is represented by M, aluminum oxide is represented by O, while copper sulphide is used as a semiconductor. However, he was unable to build a practical working FET device. The FET concept was later developed in theory by German engineer Oskar Heil in the 1930s and American physicist William Shockley in the 1940s. No practically working FETs were built at that time, and none of the early FET proposals involved thermally oxidizing silicon. Semiconductor companies initially focused on bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) in the early years of the semiconductor industry. However, junction transistors are relatively thick devices and difficult to mass produce, limiting their use to BJTs. In theory, FETs could be an alternative to junction transistors, but researchers have been unable to build practical FETs, mainly due to the surface state barrier preventing external electric fields from entering into the material. By the 1950s, researchers had mostly stopped trying the FET concept, and instead focused on BJT technology. In 1955, Carl Frosch and Lincoln Derrick accidentally coated the surface of a silicon wafer with a layer of silicon dioxide. They showed that the oxide layer prevented certain probes from entering the silicon wafer, while allowing others to enter. In doing so, they discovered the passivation effect of the oxidation of the semiconductor surface. Their next work was demonstrating how to etch tiny cracks in the oxide layer to spread the rivet over a specific part of the silicon wafer.",

The amount of clothing worn depends on functional considerations (such as the need for warmth or protection from the elements) and social considerations. In some situations a minimum amount of clothing or clothing is not socially acceptable at all, while in others clothing is much more desirable. Modern social norms regarding nudity vary widely, reflecting cultural ambiguity towards the body and sexuality, and different conceptions of what constitutes public versus private space. While most societies require appropriate clothing in most situations, others recognize non-sexual nudity as appropriate for some recreational and social activities, and value nudity in performances and media as representing positive values. Some societies and groups continue to reject nudity not only in public but also in private. Norms are codified to varying degrees by laws that define appropriate dress and indecent exposure. The loss of body hair is one of the physical characteristics that marks the biological evolution of modern humans from their hominid ancestors. Adaptations related to baldness have contributed to increased brain size, bipedalism, and variations in human skin color. While estimates vary, for at least 90,000 years anatomically modern humans did not wear clothing, a discovery that was part of the transition from not only being anatomically but also behaviorally modern. As societies developed from hunter-gatherers to agrarian ones, clothing and other body adornments were part of a cultural evolution as individuals and groups became distinguished by status, class, and individual identity. The habit of wearing new clothes begins with civilization. Throughout most of history until the early modern era, people did not dress in public out of necessity or convenience either when engaging in strenuous activities, including labor and athletics; or while bathing or swimming.",

In the colonial era, Christian and Muslim cultures were more common among tropical indigenous peoples who wore clothes for decorative or ceremonial purposes but were often naked, and had no concept of shame about their bodies. Additionally, the warm climate and way of life is conducive to functional nudity. Cultural differences continue as some previously colonized societies retain or reaffirm their traditional practices in everyday life or for special occasions celebrating their heritage. Traditional dress can include nudity, or bare-chested women and men. Societies such as those in Japan and Finland maintain traditions of communal nudity which provide an alternative to sexualization based on the use of baths and saunas. In general, social norms relating to nudity for men differ from those for women. It was only in the 17th century in Europe that women's breasts became part of the body that had to be covered in public. Only in the modern era has child nudity been portrayed as innocent. Individuals may knowingly violate norms relating to nudity; those without power could use nudity as a form of protest, and those with power could force nudity on others as a form of punishment. The encounters of indigenous African, American and Oceanian cultures with Europeans had a significant influence on both cultures.

Microbiology began with the invention of the microscope and became a very important field in biology after Louis Pasteur was able to explain the wine fermentation process and make the rabies vaccine. : biochemistry. Today's application of microbiology enters various fields and cannot be separated from other branches because it is also needed in the fields of pharmacy, medicine, agriculture, nutrition, chemical engineering, even to astrobiology and archeology.

In his famous book, Micrographia (1665), Hooke illustrates the structure of the fruiting bodies of a type of mold. This was the first published description of a microorganism. The first person to see bacteria was Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723), a Dutch amateur microscope maker. In 1684, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek used a very small microscope of his own making to observe various microorganisms in natural materials. The microscope Leeuwenhoek used at that time was a single, biconvex-shaped magnifying glass with the specimen placed between the small aperture corners of a metal holder. The instrument was held close to the eye and the object on the other side of the lens was adjusted to achieve focus.

In the following years, many other observations confirmed van Leeuwenhoek's, but progress in understanding the properties and benefits of microorganisms was slow until the next 150 years.

Pasteur's experiments using sterilized broth and goose neck flask proved the presence of microorganisms. Since the 16th century, it has been known that there is a disease-causing agent that can transmit disease. After its discovery, it was believed that the microorganism was the agent in question, but there has never been any proof. Robert Koch (1842-1910), a German physician, was the first to discover the concept of the relationship between infectious diseases and microorganisms by including experimental evidence. The concept proposed by Koch became known as Koch's Postulates and is now the gold standard for the determination of infectious diseases. General microbiology refers to non-medical aspects of microbiology. Two giants known in this era are Beijerinck and Winogradsky. The two initiated aspects of environmental microbiology.

Its name comes from the word \"renos\", which means \"high current\"). Together with the Danube it formed much of the northern frontier of the Roman Empire and has since been an important navigable waterway, influencing trade in the interior. The Rhine originates in the Alps in the Swiss region of Graub\u00fcnden, where its 2 tributaries were originally called the Vorderrhein and the Hinterrhein. The Vorderrhein (Forward Rhine) leaves Lake Tuma near the Oberalp pass and passes through the Ruinaulta (Great Swiss Cliff). The Hinterrhein (back Rhine) starts from the Paradise Glacier near the Rheinquellhorn on the southern border of Switzerland. The two tributaries meet near Reichenau, remaining at Graubunden. As it leaves Graubuenden, the River Rhine flows north to form the border with Liechtenstein and then Austria, and then empties into Lake Constance. The Rhine then appears again, flows west, mainly on the border between Switzerland and Germany, falls at the Rhein falls, followed by the Aar which is more than 2 times its volume of water, and then turns north at Basel and forms the southern part of the border between Germany and France in the broad valley, before entering sheer Germany. With more than 1,000 km, the Rhine is the longest river especially Germany. It is here that the Rhine meets a number of its main tributaries, such as the Neckar, Main and Moselle. Between Bingen and Bonn, the River Rhine flows through the Rhine Valley, a formation created by erosion, which occurred at about the same rate as uplift in the area, leaving the river at approximately its original level, and the surrounding land was uplifted.",

The River Rhine bends west into the Netherlands, where it joins the Meuse to form a large delta. Across the border into the Netherlands, the Rhine widens, but then divides into 3 main tributaries: IJssel, Waal and Nederrijn. From here things got more complicated, as the name \"Rhine\" soon coincided with the main stream of water. Most of the Rhine's waters flow further west past the Waal River and then past the Nieuwe Waterweg and, joining the Meuse, past Hollands Diep and the mouth of the Haringvliet into the North Sea. A branch of the IJssel River carries its share of water northward into the IJsselmeer where the Nederrijn River flows west parallel to the Waal River. However, past Wijk bij Duurstede this stream changed its name and became Lek. Flowing further west joins the main stream again into the Nieuwe Waterweg. The name \"Rhine\" is from here used only for the smaller streamlines that together form the main river Rhein in Roman times. Although they still use that name, this stream does not carry water from the Rhine, but is used to flow through the surrounding land and polders. From Wijk bij Duurstede, the oldest northern branch of the River Rhine is called Kromme Rijn (\"Rhine Bend\") and via Utrecht, first Leidse Rijn (\"Leiden Rhein\") and then Oude Rijn (\"Ancient Rhine\").",

Eukaryotes have a nucleus which contains DNA, whereas prokaryotes do not have a nucleus and their genetic material is not in a membrane. Because of the great structural and genetic differences between the two, in 1977 Carl Woese split the prokaryotes into Bacteria and Archaea (formerly Eubacteria and Archaebacteria), by proposing a three-domain system consisting of Eukaryotes (or \"Eukarya\"), Bacteria, and Archaea, the revision of the two kingdom system.

Bacteria and archaea reproduce asexually, ie mostly by binary fission or budding. Genetic exchange and recombination can occur, but this is horizontal gene transfer and not replication, ie it involves DNA being transferred between two cells, as is the case with bacterial conjugation. Recent research has shown that all prokaryotes have a more primitive cytoskeleton than that of eukaryotes. Despite the homology of actin and tubulin (MreB and FtsZ) the helix components of the flagella, named flagellin, are one of the most important bacterial cytoskeletal proteins as providers of the structural background of chemotaxis, the basic cell physiological response of bacteria.

Cations are positively charged ions, while anions are negatively charged ions. Therefore, a cation molecule has a hydrogen proton without an electron, whereas an anion has an extra electron. Because of their opposite electrical charges, cations and anions are attracted to each other and easily form ionic compounds. Ions containing only one atom are called monatomic ions or atomic ions, while those containing two or more atoms form molecular ions or polyatomic ions. In the case of physical ionization in a medium, such as a gas, \"ion pairs\" are created by collisions of ions, where each pair formed contains a free electron and a positive ion. Ions are also created through chemical interactions, for example dissolving a salt in a liquid, or alternatively, passing a direct current through a conducting solution dissolves the anode via ionization. The word ion comes from the Greek: \u1f30\u03cc\u03bd, ion, \"is going\", the verb being forms from the Greek: \u1f30\u03ad\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9, ienai, \"goes\".

Faraday did not know the nature of these species, but he did know that when a metal dissolves into and enters the solution at one electrode, a new metal arises from the solution at the other electrode; the substance has moved through the solution in a current.

This dissertation earned Arrhenius the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1903. Arrhenius' explanation was that in forming a solution, the salt dissociates into Faraday ions. Arrhenius proposed that ions were formed even in the absence of an electric current. Ions in their gaseous state are highly reactive and will quickly interact with ions with opposite charges to produce neutral molecules or ionic salts. Ions are also produced in the liquid or solid state when salts interact with a solvent (eg, water) to produce \"solvated ions\", which are more stable. The ions move away from each other to interact with the liquid for reasons that involve changes in energy and entropy. These stabilized species are more common in low temperature environments. A common example is the ions found in seawater, which come from dissolved salts. All ions have a charge, which means that, like other charged objects, they: Electrons, due to their small mass and large space-occupying properties, are considered matter waves. It determines the entire size of atoms and molecules that have electrons. Anions (negatively charged ions) are larger than the parent molecule or atom, because the excess electrons repel each other thereby increasing the physical size of the ion, and its size is determined by its electron cloud. Thus, in general, cations are smaller than their parent atoms or molecules because the size of their electron cloud is also smaller. The hydrogen cation has no electrons at all, so it only has a single proton - much smaller than the hydrogen atom.",

Collections of hyphae can form masses known as mycelum (mycelium, plural mycelia). Hyphae can be easily seen with the eye when they have formed mycelium. The umbrella-shaped structure commonly known to people as a mushroom is nothing but a reproductive organ known as a carpus or fruiting body, which appears only intermittently. Hyphae contain protoplasm surrounded by a strong wall. The hyphal cell wall thickness at the tip or apical is about 125-250nm. In most fungi there is a dividing wall on the hyphae. The dividing wall on the hyphae is called a septum (septum, plural septa). Hyphae that have a septum and have a single nucleus are called monocytic. Hyphae that do not have a septum and have many nuclei are called coenocytic. Hyphal growth occurs at the apical or end of the hyphae. Hyphae length is not fixed but hyphal diameter is constant, ranging from 2--30\u00b5m, depending on the species and growing conditions. Each part or piece of hyphae is capable of growing to form new hyphae. Based on its function, hyphae are divided into two, namely vegetative hyphae and reproductive hyphae. The part of the hyphae that functions to take in nutrients is called the vegetative hyphae. Vegetative hyphae grow into the substrate or fall on the substrate. Hyphae that function for reproduction are called reproductive hyphae or fertile hyphae or aerial hyphae. Reproductive hyphae are attached to the mycelium on the surface of the substrate. Reproductive hyphae can be sporangiphores, conidiophores or fruiting bodies. For fungi, hyphae have more or less a role like roots and leaves in plants at once. Hyphae grow to spread throughout the body or all parts of the organism. The fine shape of the hyphae expands the contact surface with the substrate (food object).",

Now, in terms of history, the designation of the term Azerbaijan has varied from its historical geographical designation and this has led to some political discussions. There are several hypotheses regarding the origin of the name \"Azerbaijan.\" The most common theory is that Azerbaijan was eponymously named after Atropates, satrap (governor) of the Iranian Medes, who controlled an area found in modern Iranian Azarbaijan called Atropatene. It is believed that the name Atropates is derived from an Old Persian root meaning \"protected by fire.\" There is also another opinion that this term is a thin Turkicification of Azarbaijan, an Arabicized version of the original Persian name \u00c2zar\u00e2b\u00e2dag\u00e2n, composed of \u00e2zar+\u00e2badag+\u00e2n (\u00e2zar=api; \u00e2b\u00e2dag=processed area; \u00e2n=plural ending); that traditionally the word means \"land of eternal fire\" or \"land of fire\", which may imply Zoroastrianism's fire temple in this country. Some Azeri historians think that the name is composed of 4 Azerbaijani elements: az+er+bay+can, meaning \"land of the brave Az\" or \"an elevated place for the wealthy and noble.\" Azerbaijan is also poetically called Odlar Yurdu (\"Land of Fire (Eternal)\").",

Capitalism has a long history, namely since the discovery of a trading system carried out by the private sector. In Europe, this is known as the guild as the forerunner of capitalism.

Some of these experts include: Adam Smith is a classical capitalist economic figure who criticized the mercantilism system which he considered less supportive of the people's economy. He criticizes the psyocrats who think land is the most important thing in the pattern of production. The production movement must move according to the concept of MCM (Capital-Commodity-Money), which is something that will not stop because money will turn into capital again and will rotate again when invested.

The argument given by Hippias was regarding laws that had to be amended and corrected many times. Therefore, the law is not the final norm to determine good and evil, even the law can degrade human nature. For example, the law classifies people into the categories of slaves and free people.

The word began to refer to the intentional and active rejection of god in the 5th century BC, with the definition of \"cutting off from god/gods\" or \"rejecting god/gods\". Modern translations of the classical texts sometimes render atheos as \"atheistic\".

This term was often used in debates between the early Christians and followers of the Ancient Greek (Hellenic) religion, in which each side referred to the other as atheists pejoratively. Atheism was first used to refer to \"separate belief\" in the late 18th century in Europe, primarily referring to the disbelief in a monotheistic God. In the 20th century, globalization broadened the definition of this term to refer to \"non-belief in all gods\", although it is still common to refer to atheism as \"monotheism\". Recently, there has been a push within certain philosophical groups to redefine atheism as the \"absence of belief in gods/goddesses\", rather than atheism as a belief in itself. This definition is very popular among the atheist community, although its use is still very limited. Authors differ in defining and classifying atheism, namely whether atheism is a belief in itself or simply the absence of belief, and whether atheism requires conscious and explicit rejection. Various categories have been proposed to try to distinguish the different forms of atheism.

A key aspect of the philosophy of any government is how political power is acquired \u2014 the two main forms of which are elections and hereditary succession. The origin and development of the phenomenon of human government is not known with certainty; however, history records the formation of early governments. Around 5,000 years ago, several small city-states appeared. In the third to second millennium BC, several of these city-states developed into larger fiefdoms: Sumer, Ancient Egypt, the Indus Valley Civilization, and the Yellow River Civilization. Development of agricultural projects and water control is a catalyst for the development of government. Sometimes, a chief is chosen by various rituals or tests of strength to rule the tribe, sometimes involving a group of older people as the council. Humans' ability to precisely learn and communicate abstract information allows humans to act more effectively in farming, which in turn continues to increase population densities. Historian David Christian explains how this resulted in states with laws and governments.",

The Great Revolution in England, the United States Revolution, and the French Revolution contributed to the growth of representative government. The Soviet Union was the first major country to have a communist government. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, more and more countries have adopted liberal democracy as their form of government. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, there was a significant increase in the size and scale of government at the national level, including corporate governance and the development of the welfare state. In political science, making a typology or taxonomy of political entities has long been a goal because the typology of political systems is not clear. This is especially important in comparative politics (a field within political science) and international relations. Like all categories of forms of government, the boundaries of government classification can be fluid or unclear. On the surface, all governments have an official or ideal form. The United States is a constitutional republic, while the former Soviet Union is a socialist republic. But self-identification is not objective and, as political scientists Kopstein and Lichbach say, defining regimes can be tricky. For example, the French philosopher Voltaire argued that \"the Holy Roman Empire is neither Empire nor Roman nor Holy\". Identifying a form of government is also difficult because many political systems originate from socio-economic movements which are then brought into government by parties calling themselves from these movements; all with competing political ideologies. Experience with ruling movements and the strong ties they may have to certain forms of government, may cause them to be considered a form of government itself. Other complications include general disagreement or deliberate \"distortion or bias\" of the technical definitions of political ideology and related forms of government due to the nature of politics in the modern era.",

This city is the fifth largest metropolitan city in Indonesia after Jakarta, Surabaya, Bandung, Medan and Semarang. As one of the developing cities in Java Island, Semarang City has a population of around 1.6 million people. The Semarang mega-urban area which is part of the Kedungsepur metropolitan area (Kendal, Demak, Ungaran, Semarang Regency, Salatiga City, Semarang City and Purwodadi, Grobogan Regency) has a population of 7.3 million people, as well as being the fourth most populous metropolitan area on the island of Java. after Jabodetabek (Jakarta), Gerbangkertosusilo (Surabaya), and Bandung Raya. In recent years, the significant development of Semarang has also been marked by the emergence of several skyscrapers scattered throughout the city and the arrangement of the city by the construction of pedestrian-friendly places.

The activities of utilizing biological resources that are included in agriculture are commonly understood by people as cultivating plants or cultivating crops and rearing livestock, although its scope can also be in the form of using microorganisms and bioenzymes in the processing of advanced products, such as making cheese and tempeh, or simply extraction, such as catching fish or forest exploitation. The largest part of the world's population makes a living in fields within the scope of agriculture, but agriculture only contributes 4% of world GDP. The agricultural sciences group examines agriculture with the support of supporting sciences. Because agriculture is always bound by space and time, supporting sciences, such as soil science, meteorology, agricultural engineering, biochemistry, and statistics are also studied in agriculture. Farming is a core part of agriculture because it involves a set of activities carried out in cultivation. \"Farmers\" is a term for those who carry out farming businesses, for example \"tobacco farmers\" or \"fish farmers\". Those cultivating livestock are specifically referred to as breeders. Agriculture in a broad sense includes all activities involving the use of living things (including plants, animals and microbes) for the benefit of humans. In a narrow sense, agriculture is defined as plant cultivation activities. Agricultural businesses are given special names for certain farming business subjects. Forestry is farming with plant subjects (usually trees) and cultivated on semi-wild or wild land (forest). Livestock use is subject to dry land animals (particularly all vertebrates except fish and amphibians) or insects (eg bees). The fishery has the subject of aquatic animals (including amphibians and all non-aquatic vertebrates).

All agricultural businesses are basically economic activities, so they require the same basic knowledge of business location management, selection of seeds/seedlings, cultivation methods, yield collection, product distribution, product processing and packaging, and marketing. If a farmer looks at all of these aspects with consideration of efficiency to achieve maximum profit then he does intensive farming. Agricultural business viewed in this way is known as agribusiness. Programs and policies that direct agricultural businesses to this perspective are known as intensification. Because industrial agriculture has always applied intensive farming, the two are often confused. The side of industrial agriculture that pays attention to its environment is sustainable agriculture. Sustainable agriculture, also known as its variations such as organic farming or permaculture, incorporates aspects of the sustainability of the carrying capacity of the land as well as the environment and local knowledge as important factors in calculating its efficiency. As a result, sustainable agriculture usually yields lower yields than industrial agriculture. Modern agriculture today usually employs some components of both poles of the agricultural \"ideology\" mentioned above. In addition to these two, there are also known forms of extensive farming (low input agriculture) which in the most extreme and traditional forms will take the form of subsistence farming, which is only carried out without business motives and solely to meet one's own needs or that of the community. As a business, agriculture has two important characteristics: it always involves large volumes of goods and the production process has a relatively high risk. These two characteristics arise because agriculture involves living things in one or several stages and requires space for these activities and a certain period of time in the production process.

Egyptian astronomers left monuments showing knowledge of the constellations and the motions of the celestial bodies, while the Greek poet Homer described various celestial bodies in his Iliad and Odyssey; later Greek astronomers gave the names, which are still used today, to most of the constellations visible from the northern hemisphere. Natural philosophy originated in Greece in the Archaic period, (650 BCE \u2013 480 BCE), when pre-Socratic philosophers such as Thales rejected non-naturalistic explanations for natural phenomena and argued that every event had a natural cause. They proposed ideas that were proven by reason and observation, and many of their hypotheses proved successful in experiments; for example, atomism was finally confirmed 2,000 years after it was first proposed by Leucippus and his student Democritus.

He expressed his assumption that the human self has a set of ideas. If it is explained that the essence or nature of the mind is thinking, then the idea is a way of thinking that represents an object for the mind. Descartes grouped ideas into three types, namely innate ideas, adventitious ideas, and factitious ideas. The goal is to convey ideas in the form of evidence data, reasoning results, and other thoughts in order to convince listeners or readers about the truth, or conclusions of the speaker. The ideas conveyed are also intended to be able to solve problems or as solutions or ways to overcome problems. The ideas conveyed are objective and reasonable and are often also known as opinions. Innate ideas in philosophy are ideas thought to be born in the human mind, different from those received or compiled from experience. Innate ideas encompass at least certain ideas (e.g., ideas about God, immensity, substance of thought), because no satisfactory empirical origin of them can be understood. Adventitious ideas are ideas that come from outside, from objects, and outside the mind. This goes against the innate idea. Descartes' form of the ontological argument about God is built on the idea of \u200b\u200badventitious ideas. Artificial ideas are artificial ideas whose contents are derived from the contents of other ideas, no doubt included in the category of non-primary ideas or ideas that originate from the objective reality of some other ideas. Factors that serve as benchmarks for conveying ideas can be grouped into several parts, namely 1) The ideas put forward are related to the problem, 2) The ideas put forward accelerate understanding of the problem, find causes and solve problems, 3) The ideas put forward do not repeat ideas that have been communicated by other participants, 4) Ideas submitted are supported by factors, examples, illustrations, comparisons or testimonies, 5) Language that expresses thoughts with the correct words and sentences, 6) Actions, expressions, tone, stress, and intonation used can clarify thoughts conveyed, and 7) Expressing ideas in a polite and unemotional manner.",

This constant state includes variables, such as body temperature and body fluid balance, which are maintained within predetermined limits (which are called homeostatic ranges). Examples of other variables are the pH of the extracellular fluid, the concentrations of sodium, potassium, and calcium ions, and blood sugar levels. These things need to be maintained even though the environment, diet, and body activities are constantly changing. Each of these variables is controlled by one or several mechanisms that together sustain life. When things are in optimal conditions, homeostasis appears as a natural resistance to change. Balanced conditions are maintained and regulated by many mechanisms. All mechanisms that control homeostasis have at least three interdependent components, namely receptors, control centers, and effectors, each of which is present for each regulated variable. Receptors are sensing components that monitor and respond to changes in the environment, both external and internal. Receptors include temperature receptors and mechanical receptors. Control centers such as the respiratory center and the renin-angiotensin system. The effector is the target that is acted upon so that changes are returned to their normal state. The concept of regulation of the internal environment was explained by the French physiologist Claude Bernard in 1849, while the word homeostasis was coined by Walter Bradford Cannon in 1926. In 1932, Joseph Barcroft, a British physiologist, said that the higher functions of the brain require the most internal environment. stable. For Barcroft, homeostasis is not only regulated by the brain, but also serves the brain. Homeostasis is an almost exclusively biological term, referring to the concept explained by Bernard and Cannon, regarding the constant internal environment in which the body's cells live and survive.",

Metabolic processes in all organisms can only occur in a very specific physical and chemical environment. Conditions vary from organism to organism and depend on whether chemical processes take place inside the cells or in the interstitial fluid that bathes the cells. The best known mechanisms of homeostasis in mammals are regulators that keep the composition of the extracellular fluid (or \"internal environment\") constant, especially with respect to temperature, pH, osmolality, and concentrations of sodium, potassium, glucose, carbon dioxide, and oxygen. There are many other homeostatic mechanisms that regulate various aspects of physiology in the body. When the level of a variable is higher or lower than required, each of these conditions is often preceded by hyper- and hypo-, such as hyperthermia and hypothermia or hypertension and hypotension. If an entity is controlled through homeostasis, that does not imply that its values \u200b\u200bmust be strictly stable to maintain health. Core body temperature, for example, is regulated by homeostatic mechanisms by temperature sensors, one of which is the hypothalamus in the brain.

For example, core body temperature in humans varies throughout the day (influenced by circadian rhythms), with the lowest temperature occurring at night and the highest in the afternoon.

The city (2007) had a population of around 3.3 million, making it the largest city in Germany and the second largest city in the European Union after London. Located in northeastern Germany and fed by the River Spree, the city is the center of the Berlin-Brandenburg Metropolitan Area, which has a population of around 4.5 million people from more than 180 countries. About a third of the city consists of forests and city parks, as well as lakes and rivers. First documented in the 13th century, Berlin was the capital of the Kingdom of Prussia (1701\u20131918), the German Empire (1871\u20131918), the Weimar Republic (1919\u201333) and Nazi Germany (1933\u201345). Berlin in the 1920s was the third largest municipality in the world.

After German reunification in 1990, the city again became the national capital of Germany and is home to 147 embassies of foreign countries. Besides being a city, Berlin is also one of 16 German states, which acts as the center of European Union political activities, as well as being the busiest metropolis in Europe.

Semiconductor materials consist of 4 valence electrons. The types of semiconductor materials commonly used are carbon, germanium, and silicon. Based on the type of doping, semiconductor materials are divided into two types, namely type P and type N. A semiconductor acts as an electrical insulator if it is not given an electric current in a certain way and with a certain amount of electric current. However, at temperatures, electric currents, procedures and certain work requirements, semiconductors function as conductors, for example as current amplifiers, voltage amplifiers and power amplifiers. To use a semiconductor so that it can function, you must know the specifications and characteristics of the semiconductor, if it does not meet the operating requirements it will not function and be damaged. Semiconductors are very useful in electronics, because their conductance can be varied by injecting other materials (often called electron donors). Semiconductors are used in a variety of semiconductor devices. The electrical properties of a material, including semiconductors, can be described using an energy band diagram. The energy band diagram explains that from a group of atoms that are neatly arranged to form a certain crystal structure, there are only a number of energy levels that can be occupied by electrons. The electrons will occupy the lower energy level first. The last band filled with electrons is called the valence band. The number of energy levels after the valence band is called the conduction band. The distance between the lowest energy level in the conduction band and the highest energy level in the valence band is called the bandgap. In silicon, this band gap is 1.1 eV. Semiconductor materials consisting of the same elements are called intrinsic semiconductors. This intrinsic semiconductor has certain electrical properties at a certain temperature, for example the number of charge carriers.",

Extrinsic semiconductors can be distinguished based on the group of doping atoms. P-type semiconductors are semiconductors with very few electrons. The material for making P-type semiconductors is a mixture of germanium atoms and indium atoms or other atoms that have 3 valence electrons, e.g., boron, aluminum, gallium. The P-type semiconductor is positively charged because indium has fewer electrons than germanium. The N-type semiconductor is a semiconductor with a large number of electrons. The material for making N-type semiconductors is a mixture of germanium atoms and arsenic atoms or other atoms that have 5 valence electrons, e.g. phosphorus, arsenic, antimony. The N-type semiconductor is negatively charged because arsenic has more electrons than germanium. The electric current strength in semiconductor materials cannot be known precisely through Ohm's law. The application of Ohm's law only applies to electric circuits that have an electric current that is always directly proportional to the value of the working voltage. On the other hand, semiconductor materials do not always have an electric current that is a linear function of the applied voltage. The electric current that flows through the semiconductor material can experience a linear function, a quadratic function or a cubic function with respect to the working voltage value. In semiconductor materials the Hall effect applies which determines the electric current density expressed in charge per unit volume. The value of electric voltage on a semiconductor material is determined by the concentration of electric charges carried into the electric material.",

One of the most common forms of synesthesia, known as grapheme-color synesthesia or color-graphemic synesthesia, is where letters or numbers appear to have a particular color perception. In spatial sequence, or number synesthesia, various numbers, months of the year, or days of the week give rise to the perception of a particular location in space (for example, 1980 may feel \"farther\" than 1990), or may appear as a three-dimensional map (clockwise or counterclockwise). Synthetic associations can occur in any combination and involve any number of sensory or cognitive pathways. Little is known about how synesthesia develops. It has been suggested that synesthesia develops during childhood when children are intensively involved with abstract concepts for the first time. This hypothesis is called the semantic vacuum hypothesis\u2014which explains why the most common forms of synesthesia are synesthesia of grapheme colors, spatial sequences, and number shapes.

Under standard conditions, it is the lightest metal as well as the lightest solid element. Like all alkali metals, lithium is highly reactive and flammable, and is stored in mineral oil. When cut open inside, it revealed a metallic sheen, but the damp air stained it quickly to a dull silvery-gray, then formed black spots. Lithium never occurs as a free element in nature, but only as compounds (usually ionic), such as the mineral pegmatite, which was once the main source of lithium. It is present in seawater and is usually obtained from saltwater, because of its solubility as an ion. Lithium metal is isolated electrolytically from a mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride. Lithium atomic nuclei vibrate at instability, because the two stable lithium isotopes found in nature have the lowest bond energies per nucleon of all stable nuclides. Lithium is less abundant in the solar system than any of the 25 elements of the first 32 chemical elements despite its very light nucleus, due to its relative nuclear instability: this is an exception to the trend that the heavier the nucleus, the less abundant it is. For this reason, lithium has important uses in nuclear physics.

In studies from the 1970s\u20131990s, mice and goats on low-lithium diets had higher mortality, as well as reproductive and behavioral abnormalities. In humans there are no defined lithium deficiency diseases, but low lithium intake from the water supply is associated with increased suicide, homicide and arrest rates for drug use and other crimes. The high lithium content in the early embryo suggests an important role during fetal development. The biochemical mechanisms of lithium action appear to be multifactorial and correlated with the functions of several enzymes, hormones and vitamins, as well as growth and transformation factors. The evidence currently seems insufficient to accept lithium as essential; The temporary RDA for 70 kg adults is suggested to be 1,000 \u00b5g/day. Lithium salts have been shown to be useful as mood medications in the treatment of bipolar disorder in humans. Like the other alkali metals, lithium has a single valence electron which is easily released to form cations. Therefore, lithium is a good conductor of heat and electricity and is highly reactive, although it is the least reactive of the alkali metals. Lithium's low reactivity is due to the proximity of its valence electrons to its nucleus (the remaining two electrons are in the 1s orbital, which is much lower in energy, and do not participate in chemical bonds).",

Muslim rulers, both from within and from around the region, have long tried to seize the city of Mecca and keep the city under their control. Thus, like much of the Hijaz region, the city underwent various regime changes which owe its rich history. The city was eventually captured in the conquest of the Hijaz by the Saudis led by Ibn Saud and his allies in 1925. Since then, Mecca has seen a tremendous expansion in size and infrastructure with newer modern buildings such as the Abraj Al Bait Towers, the fourth tallest building in the world. and the third largest based on the floor area that towers over the Grand Mosque.",

It is a nonmetal and is tetravalent\u2014its atoms make four electrons available to form covalent chemical bonds. It is in group 14 of the periodic table. Carbon only makes up about 0.025 percent of the Earth's crust. Three isotopes occur naturally, 12C and 13C are stable nuclides, while 14C is a radionuclide, decaying with a half-life of about 5,730 years. Carbon is one of the few elements that has been known since ancient times. Carbon is the 15th most abundant element in the Earth's crust, and the fourth most abundant element in the universe by mass after hydrogen, helium and oxygen. The abundance of carbon, its unique diversity of organic compounds, and its unusual ability to form polymers at temperatures normally encountered on Earth, allow it to function as a common element of all known life. It is the second most abundant element in the human body by mass (about 18.5%) after oxygen. Carbon atoms can bond together in a variety of ways, producing various allotropes of carbon. The most well-known allotropes of carbon include graphite, diamond, amorphous carbon and fullerene. The physical properties of carbon vary greatly with its allotropic form. For example, graphite is opaque and black whereas diamond is highly transparent. Graphite is soft enough to scratch on paper (hence the name from the Greek verb \"\u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd\" meaning \"to write\"), while diamond is the hardest known naturally occurring material.

The largest sources of inorganic carbon are limestone, dolomite and carbon dioxide, but significant amounts occur in organic deposits, namely coal, peat, oil and methane clathrate. Carbon forms a very large number of compounds, more than any other element, with almost ten million compounds described to date, but these are only a fraction of the number of compounds that are theoretically possible under standard conditions. For this reason, carbon is often referred to as the \"king of all elements\". Allotropes of carbon include graphite, one of the softest known substances, and diamond, the hardest naturally occurring substance. It readily bonds with other small atoms, including other carbon atoms, and is capable of forming several stable covalent bonds with suitable multivalent atoms. Carbon is known to form nearly ten million compounds, the most of all chemical compounds. Carbon also has the highest sublimation point of all the elements. At atmospheric pressure it has no melting point, because its triple point is at 108 \u00b1 02 megapascals (1,066 \u00b1 20 atm; 15,660 \u00b1 290 psi) and 4,600 \u00b1 300 K (4,330 \u00b1 300 \u00b0C; 7,820 \u00b1 540 \u00b0F), so it sublimes at about 3,900 K (3,630\u00b0C; 6,560\u00b0F).

The term anatomy is used for the study of the structure of the human and animal bodies, while the structure of plants is studied in plant anatomy. Anatomy has been studied since prehistoric times. Anatomy and physiology, which study the structure and function of organisms and their parts respectively, are natural partners of related disciplines, and the two are often studied together. Human anatomy is one of the essential basic sciences applied in medicine. The discipline of anatomy is broadly divided into macroscopic and microscopic anatomy. Macroscopic anatomy, or gross anatomy, is the examination of body parts using unaided vision. Macroscopic anatomy also includes superficial anatomy. Microscopic anatomy involves the use of optical instruments to study tissue, which is known as histology, and also in the study of cells. Historically, anatomy has experienced a progressive development of the understanding of the structure and function of the human body. The methods used have improved dramatically, from examining animals by cadaveric and carcass dissection to medical imaging techniques developed in the 20th century, such as X-rays, ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging.

The discipline of anatomy can be subdivided into several branches, including macroscopic anatomy and microscopic anatomy. Macroscopic anatomy is the study of structures large enough to be seen with the naked eye, and also includes surface or superficial anatomy, the study of the external characteristics of the body. Microscopic anatomy is the study of body structure on a microscopic scale, along with histology (the study of tissues) and embryology (the study of organisms in prenatal conditions). Anatomy can be studied using both invasive and noninvasive methods with the aim of obtaining information about the structure and organization of organs and organ systems. Methods used include dissection, in which the body is opened and the organs studied, and endoscopy, in which instruments equipped with a video camera are inserted through small incisions on the surface of the body and used to explore internal organs and other structures. Angiography using X-rays or magnetic resonance angiography is a method for visualizing blood vessels. The term \"anatomy\" is usually used to refer to human anatomy. However, substantially the same structures and tissues are found throughout the animal kingdom and the term also includes the anatomy of other animals. The term zootomy is also sometimes used to specifically refer to the anatomy of nonhuman animals. Plant structures and tissues have different properties and are studied in plant anatomy. All vertebrates have a similar basic body cross-section and at some point in their lives (mostly at the embryonic stage), they share the main chordate characteristics, namely, the notochord which is a rigid rod; hollow neuronal tube dorsally and filled with neural material; pharyngeal arches; and a tail behind the anus.",

It is a highly radioactive synthetic element whose most stable isotope is 265Rf with a half-life of about 13 hours. This name is taken from the name of the scientist Ernst Rutherford. Later this element was not used for anything and little was known about it. Ruterfordium was the first transactinide element and is thought to have chemical properties similar to hafnium. Ruterfordium (named in honor of Lord Rutherford of Nelson) was first reported as synthesized in 1964 at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna (Soviet Union). Researchers there bombarded 242Pu with 22Ne ions with MeV accelerated from 113 to 115 and stated that they detected traces of nuclear fusion in a special type of glass with a microscope that indicated the presence of the new element. In 1969 researchers from the University of California, Berkeley synthesized the element by subjecting 249Cf and 12C to high energy collisions. The UC group also stated that they were unable to reproduce the earliest synthesis by Soviet scientists. This gave rise to controversy over the naming of elements; Since the Soviets claimed that it was first detected in Dubna, Dubnium (Db) was proposed, like Kurchatovium and the symbol Ku for the 104th element, in honor of Igor Vasilevich Kurchatov (1903\u20131960), former head of Soviet nuclear research. The Americans, however, proposed Rutherfordium (symbol Rf) for the new element in honor of Ernest Rutherford, the famous nuclear physicist from New Zealand.

Gross Domestic Product is defined as the total value of all goods and services produced in the region in a certain period of time (usually per year). GDP differs from gross national product in that it includes factor income from abroad working in the country. So that GDP calculates the total production of a country without taking into account whether the production is carried out using domestic factors of production or not. On the other hand, GNP pays attention to the origin of the production factors used. Nominal GDP refers to the value of GDP without regard to the effect of prices. Meanwhile, real GDP \u2190(or called GDP at constant prices)\u2192 corrects the nominal GDP figure by including the effect of prices. GDP can be calculated using two approaches, namely the expenditure approach and the income approach. The general formula for GDP using the expenditure approach is: Where consumption is expenditure made by households, investment by the business sector, government spending by the government, and exports and imports involving the foreign sector. While the income approach calculates the income received by factors of production, where rent is the income of the owner of a fixed factor of production such as land, wages for labor, interest for owners of capital, and profits for entrepreneurs. In theory, GDP with the expenditure and income approach should produce the same figure.

Some of the things that cause humans to live by moving from place to place of residence are due to the changing seasons, in addition to obtaining the materials needed by these nomadic groups. Nomadic habits exist in the Arabian peninsula, Africa, inland tribes in Indonesia who intend to find land for food sources, livestock, game, farming, and so on. In the past, nomadic peoples were often referred to as 'nomads' who crossed the land without a certain pattern with the aim of obtaining resources that were spread unequally over a wide area. Migration is their distinct cultural identity as a land management strategy for sustainable use and conservation.

The culprit is defined as a member of a nation who travels from one place to another to find fresh pastures for animals and has no permanent residence.

It works to uncover the structures that underlie all that humans do, think, feel, and feel. Or, as philosopher Simon Blackburn summarizes it, structuralism is \"the belief that the phenomena of human life are not understood except through their interrelationships. These relationships constitute structure, and behind local variations in phenomena that appear on the surface are constant laws of abstract culture\". Structuralism in Europe developed in the early 1900s, in the field of structural linguistics from Ferdinand de Saussure to the subsequent Prague, Moscow and Copenhagen schools of linguistics. In the late 1950s and early 60s, when structural linguistics faced serious challenges from the likes of Noam Chomsky and thus waned in importance, an array of scholars in the humanities borrowed Saussure's concepts for use in their respective fields of study.

As an intellectual movement, structuralism was originally considered to be the heir to existentialism. However, in the 1960s, many of the basic tenets of structuralism came under attack from a new wave of intellectuals especially from France such as the philosopher and historian Michel Foucault, the philosopher and social commentator Jacques Derrida, the Marxist philosopher Louis Althusser, and the literary critic Roland Barthes. Although elements of their work are always related to structuralism and informed by it, these theories are generally referred to as post-structuralist. In the 1970s, structuralism was criticized for rigidity and ahistorism. Despite this, many proponents of structuralism, such as Lacan, continue to assert influence on continental philosophy and many of the basic assumptions of some structuralist critics are that post-structuralists are a continuation of structuralism. Structuralism's goal is to seek the deepest structure of reality that appears chaotic and varied on the surface scientifically (objectively, strictly and remotely). These characteristics can be seen in its structure: 1966 was described by Francois Dosse in his book Histoire du Structuralism as the year when structuralism emerged in Europe, especially in France. The development of structuralism in 1967-1978 is described as a period of spreading the ideas of structuralism and enlightenment about the concept of structuralism and its role in science. The characteristics of structuralism is the focus on the description of the actual state of the object through investigation, disclosure of character, properties related to a thing through education. These characteristics can be seen from several things; hierarchies, components or elements, there are methods, clear theoretical models and clear distinctions. Structuralism experts opposed existentialism and phenomenology which they considered too individualistic and unscientific. One of the well-known is Maurice Merleau-Ponty's views against the phenomenology and existentialism of the human body.",

Archaea are classified as prokaryotes, a group of microbes that lack a cell nucleus and membrane-bound organelles. Originally, archaea were classified as bacteria and given the name archaebacteria (in the kingdom Archaebacteria), but this classification is no longer used. Archaic cells have unique properties that separate archaea from the other two domains of life, namely Bacteria and Eukaryota. Archaea are further divided into several phyla. Classification is difficult because the majority of archaea have not been isolated in the laboratory and their gene sequences have only been detected from samples taken from the environment. Archaea and bacteria are generally similar in size and shape, although some archaea have very odd shapes, for example the flat, square cells like Haloquadratum walsbyi. Despite the morphological similarities between archaea and bacteria, archaea share genes and several metabolic pathways that are more similar to those of eukaryotes, especially the enzymes involved in transcription and translation. One unique aspect of archaea biochemistry is the dependence of archaea on the ether lipids in their cell membranes. Archaea use more energy sources than eukaryotes, which range from organic compounds such as sugars, ammonia, metal ions, or even hydrogen gas. The salt-tolerant archaea (Haloarchaea) use sunlight as an energy source, while other archaea species fix carbon; however, unlike plants and cyanobacteria, no archaea do both ways. Archaea reproduce asexually by binary fission, fragmentation, or budding. Unlike bacteria and eukaryotes, no archaea species are known to form endospores. The first archaea observed were extremophiles living in extreme environments, such as hot springs and salt lakes, with no other organisms.",

They are abundant in the oceans, and archaea in the form of plankton are probably one of the most abundant groups of organisms on the planet. Archaea played a major role in life on Earth. They are part of the microbiota for all organisms. As the human microbiota, archaea play an important role in the large intestine, oral cavity and skin. Their morphological, metabolic and geographical diversity allows them to have a wide range of ecological roles, for example in carbon fixation in the carbon cycle, roles in the nitrogen cycle, cycling of organic compounds, and maintaining symbiotic communities and microbial syntrophy. There are no clear examples of archaea that are pathogenic or parasitic. In contrast, archaea are often mutualists or commensals, for example the methanogens that live in the digestive tracts of humans and ruminants, where they live in large numbers and aid digestion. Methanogens are used in biogas production and sewage treatment. Meanwhile, enzymes from extremophile archaea which can withstand high temperatures and organic solvents are utilized in biotechnology. For most of the 20th century, prokaryotes were considered as a single group of organisms and classified based on their biochemical, morphological, and metabolic properties. Microbiologists try to classify microorganisms based on the structure of their cell walls, shape, and the substances they ingest. In 1965, Linus Pauling and Emile Zuckerkandl proposed using gene sequences in various prokaryotes to work out their relationships to one another. This approach, known as phylogenetics, is the main method used today. Archaea (then only known methanogens) were first classified as a separate group of bacteria on a phylogenetic tree based on their ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequence by Carl Woese and George E. Fox in 1977.",

A chemical reaction will occur if an electric current is passed through the electrolyte solution, i.e. electrical energy (electric current) is converted into chemical energy (redox reaction). The three main characteristics are: The electrode which receives electrons from an external electric current source is called the cathode, while the electrode which sends electrons back to the external electric current source is called the anode. The cathode is where the reduction reaction occurs where the electrode is negative (-) and the anode is where the oxidation reaction occurs where the electrode is positive (+). In the early 19th century, Michael Faraday investigated the relationship between the amount of electricity flowing in a cell and the chemical quantity changed at the electrodes during electrolysis. He summarized his observations in two laws in 1833. C (Coulomb) is a unit of electric charge, and 1 C is the charge produced when a current of 1 A (Ampere) flows for 1 second. The fundamental constant of electricity is the Faraday constant, F = 9.65 x 104 C, which is defined as the quantity of electricity carried by 1 mole of electrons. It is possible to calculate the mole quantity of a chemical change caused by the constant flow of an electric current for a certain period of time. Electrical conduction through an electrolyte solution can be thought of as a flow of electrons. So, if electrons can flow in an electrolyte solution, it means that electricity can flow in that solution. Electrons come from the cathode pole or negative pole. Meanwhile, the anode releases positive ions and forms a precipitate on the cathode metal. In the solution, the process decomposes: CuSO4 \u2192 Cu2+ + SO42- Cu2+ ions will move towards the cathode plate, while SO42- ions will go to the anode plate.

Pompeii is located at coordinates 40\u00b045\u203200\u2033N 14\u00b029\u203210\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff40.75000\u00b0N 14.48611\u00b0E\ufeff / 40.75000; 14.48611, southeast of the city of Naples, close to the modern city of Pompeii. This city stands on a location formed by lava flows to the north on the lower reaches of the Sarno River (in ancient times it was called \"Sarnus\"). Today it is some distance inland, but it used to be an area close to the coast. In the first century C.E., Pompeii was just one of many cities located at the foot of Mount Vesuvius. This region is quite large in number of people who become prosperous because of the fertile agricultural area. Several small town groups around Pompeii such as Herculaneum also suffered damage or destruction by the eruption of Vesuvius. The city of Pompeii was founded around the 6th century BC by the Osci or Oscan people, a group of people in central Italy. At that time, the city was already used as a safe harbor by Greek and Phoenician sailors. When the Etruscans threatened attack, the city of Pompeii allied with the Greeks who then controlled the Gulf of Naples. In the 5th century BC the people of Samnium occupied it (along with all the cities of Campania).",

It is also believed that during the occupation of the people of Samnium, Rome briefly reconquered Pompeii, but this theory has not been proven. Pompeii took part in the wars started by the cities of Campania against Rome, but in 89 BC the city was besieged by Sulla. Although Social League troops led by Lucius Cluentius assisted against Rome, in 80 BC Pompeii was forced to surrender after the conquest of Nola. Pompeii then became a Roman colony with the name: Colonia Cornelia Veneria Pompeianorum. The city was an important route for goods arriving by sea and had to be sent to Rome or Southern Italy which lay along the nearby Via Appia. In AD 62, a great earthquake destroyed Pompeii along with many other cities in Campania. Sometime between 62 AD and the great eruption of Vesuvius in 79 AD, the city was rebuilt, perhaps more magnificent in terms of buildings and works of art than before. The inhabitants of Pompeii, like those who live in the area today, have long been accustomed to slight tremors, but on February 5, 62 there was a great earthquake which caused considerable damage around the bay and in particular to Pompeii. Some of the damage was still not repaired when the volcano erupted. Archived 2012-01-21 on the Wayback Machine..

Archaea are classified as prokaryotes, a group of microbes that lack a cell nucleus and membrane-bound organelles. Originally, archaea were classified as bacteria and given the name archaebacteria (in the kingdom Archaebacteria), but this classification is no longer used. Archaic cells have unique properties that separate archaea from the other two domains of life, namely Bacteria and Eukaryota. Archaea are further divided into several phyla. Classification is difficult because the majority of archaea have not been isolated in the laboratory and their gene sequences have only been detected from samples taken from the environment. Archaea and bacteria are generally similar in size and shape, although some archaea have very odd shapes, for example the flat, square cells like Haloquadratum walsbyi. Despite the morphological similarities between archaea and bacteria, archaea share genes and several metabolic pathways that are more similar to those of eukaryotes, especially the enzymes involved in transcription and translation. One unique aspect of archaea biochemistry is the dependence of archaea on the ether lipids in their cell membranes. Archaea use more energy sources than eukaryotes, which range from organic compounds such as sugars, ammonia, metal ions, or even hydrogen gas. The salt-tolerant archaea (Haloarchaea) use sunlight as an energy source, while other archaea species fix carbon; however, unlike plants and cyanobacteria, no archaea do both ways. Archaea reproduce asexually by binary fission, fragmentation, or budding. Unlike bacteria and eukaryotes, no archaea species are known to form endospores. The first archaea observed were extremophiles living in extreme environments, such as hot springs and salt lakes, with no other organisms.",

        "paragraph": "The increasing capabilities of molecular detection tools have made it possible to find archaea in almost any habitat, including land, oceans and swamps. They are abundant in the oceans, and archaea in the form of plankton are probably one of the most abundant groups of organisms on the planet. Archaea played a major role in life on Earth. They are part of the microbiota for all organisms. As the human microbiota, archaea play an important role in the large intestine, oral cavity and skin. Their morphological, metabolic and geographical diversity allows them to have a wide range of ecological roles, for example in carbon fixation in the carbon cycle, roles in the nitrogen cycle, cycling of organic compounds, and maintaining symbiotic communities and microbial syntrophy. There are no clear examples of archaea that are pathogenic or parasitic. In contrast, archaea are often mutualists or commensals, for example the methanogens that live in the digestive tracts of humans and ruminants, where they live in large numbers and aid digestion. Methanogens are used in biogas production and sewage treatment. Meanwhile, enzymes from extremophile archaea which can withstand high temperatures and organic solvents are utilized in biotechnology. For most of the 20th century, prokaryotes were considered as a single group of organisms and classified based on their biochemical, morphological, and metabolic properties. Microbiologists try to classify microorganisms based on the structure of their cell walls, shape, and the substances they ingest. In 1965, Linus Pauling and Emile Zuckerkandl proposed using gene sequences in various prokaryotes to work out their relationships to one another. This approach, known as phylogenetics, is the main method used today. Archaea (then only known methanogens) were first classified as a separate group of bacteria on a phylogenetic tree based on their ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequence by Carl Woese and George E. Fox in 1977.",

        "paragraph": "Photosynthesis is a biochemical process of forming carbohydrates from inorganic materials carried out by plants, especially plants that contain a green substance, namely chlorophyll. Apart from those containing green leaf substances, there are also living things that photosynthesize, namely algae, and several types of bacteria that use nutrients, carbon dioxide and water and need the help of sunlight energy. Almost all living things depend on the energy produced in the process of photosynthesis. As a result of photosynthesis is essential for life on earth. Photosynthesis is also credited with producing most of the oxygen contained in the earth's atmosphere. Organisms that produce energy through photosynthesis (photos means light) are referred to as phototrophs. Photosynthesis is one way of assimilation of carbon because in photosynthesis free carbon from CO2 is bound (fixed) into sugar as an energy storage molecule. Another way organisms take to assimilate carbon is through chemosynthesis, which is carried out by a number of sulfur bacteria. Although there are still steps in photosynthesis that are not understood, the general equation of photosynthesis has been known since the 1800's. In the early 1600s, a physician and chemist, Jan van Helmont, a Flanders (now part of Belgium), conducted experiments to find out what factors caused plant mass to increase over time. From his research, Helmont concluded that the mass of plants increases only because of the provision of water. However, in 1727, the English botanist Stephen Hales hypothesized that something other than water must be at play. He suggested that most plant food comes from the atmosphere and light involved in certain processes. At that time it was not known that air contained different gaseous elements. In 1771, Joseph Priestley, an English chemist and clergyman, discovered that when he covered a burning candle with an overturned jar, the flame would go out before the candle burned out.",

From the two experiments, Priestley concluded that the candle flame had \"corrupted\" the air in the jar and caused the death of the mice. He then showed that the air that had been \"damaged\" by the wax could be \"restored\" by plants. He also showed that rats can survive in closed jars as long as there are plants inside. In 1778, Jan Ingenhousz, Austrian royal physician, repeated Priestley's experiments. He showed that sunlight affects plants so that they can \"restore\" \"damaged\" air. He also found that plants also 'polluted the air' in the dark so he then suggested that plants should be removed from homes at night to prevent possible poisoning of the occupants. Finally in 1782, Jean Senebier, a French priest, showed that the air that was \"restored\" and \"damaged\" was carbon dioxide absorbed by plants in photosynthesis. It wasn't long before Theodore de Saussure was able to demonstrate a link between Stephen Hale's hypothesis and air \"recovery\" experiments. He found that the increase in plant mass was due not only to the absorption of carbon dioxide, but also to the provision of water. It was through this series of experiments that the experts finally succeeded in describing the general equation of photosynthesis which produces food (such as glucose). The process of photosynthesis cannot take place in every cell, but only in cells that contain photosynthetic pigments. Cells that do not have photosynthetic pigments are unable to carry out the process of photosynthesis. In Jan Ingenhousz's experiment, it can be seen that light intensity affects the rate of photosynthesis in plants. This can happen because of the difference in energy produced by each spectrum of light. In addition to these energy differences, another factor that is differentiating is the ability of leaves to absorb these different light spectrums.",

Mah\u0101y\u0101na, who was born in India, is used in three main senses: Although the origins of Mah\u0101y\u0101na date back to Gautama Buddha, historians have concluded that Mah\u0101y\u0101na originated in India in the 1st century, or 1st century BC. According to historians, Mahayana became a major movement in Buddhism in India in the 5th century, from that time Mahayana texts began to appear in inscriptions in India. Prior to the 11th century (when Mahayana was still in India), the Mahayana Sutras were still in the process of being refined. Therefore, multiple silks of the same silk may appear. These translations are not considered by historians to form Mahayana history. In the course of its history, Mah\u0101y\u0101na spread throughout East Asia. Countries that adhere to Mahayana teachings today are China, Japan, Korea and Vietnam and adherents of Tibetan Buddhism (the Himalayan ethnicity resulting from the Chinese invasion of Tibet). The current schools of Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism are \"Pure Land\", Zen, Nichiren, Singon, Tibetan and Tendai. The last three have schools of both Mah\u0101y\u0101na and Vajrayana teachings. Buddha was born in the 6th century BC. After attaining Perfect Enlightenment at the age of 35 to Mahaparinibbana at the age of 80, He spent his whole life preaching and spreading his teachings.

After the formation of the Sangha assembly of Bhiku and Bhikuni, the Buddha laid down certain disciplinary rules called the Vinaya as guidelines for the community. All of his teachings are called Dhamma, including discourses, sutras, sermons to monks, nuns and ordinary people. Three months after Buddha Mahaparinibbana, his closest followers held a assembly at Rajagaha. Maha Kassapa, the most respected and elder of the monks, presided over the assembly. Also present were two disciples who were especially skilled in two teachings \u2013 Dhamma and Vinaya (discipline, ethics). One was Ananda, the closest friend and follower of the Buddha for 25 years. Gifted with an extraordinary memory, Ananda was able to repeat what the Buddha had said. Another was Upali who memorized all the Vinaya rules. Only these two teachings - the Dhamma and the Vinaya - were recited at the First Council. Although there is no disagreement about the Dhamma (excluding the Abhidhamma), there is some discussion about the Vinaya rules. Before the Buddha's parinibbana, he told Ananda that if the Sangha wanted to correct or change some baseless rules, they could do so. But at that time, Ananda was so grieved over the imminent death of the Buddha that he did not ask the Buddha which of the rules he was referring to. Since the members of the assembly could not agree on what was meant by the non-fundamental rules, Maha Kassapa finally decreed that the rules laid down by the Buddha were not changed and no new rules were added.",

Genomics is impossible to stand as a branch of science without the help of bioinformatics because the object of study is very large (sequences of nitrogenous bases) and requires complex data management. Included in the study is the structure, organization and function. The object of study is DNA as a whole (nuclear/nuclear DNA, cpDNA, and mtDNA) or parts (\"genes\"). RNA as genetic material or DNA made from RNA (cDNA) is also the object of genomic studies. From the Greek gene, \"gene\" (gamma, epsilon, nu, epsilon) meaning \"to become, make, create, give birth to\", and the following variants: genealogy, genesis, genetics, genic, genomere, genotype, genus etc. While the word genome (from the German Genome, attributed to Hans Winkler) was used in English as early as 1926, the term genomics was coined by Tom Roderick, a geneticist at the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Maine), over a beer at a meeting held in Maryland on mapping the human genome in 1986.

This involves two closely related methods that produce short oligonucleotides with a defined 3' termini. It can be fractionated by electrophoresis on a polyacrylamide gel (called polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) and visualized using autoradiography. This procedure can sequence up to 80 nucleotides in one go and is a huge improvement, but still very laborious. Nevertheless, in 1977 his group was able to sequence most of the 5,386 nucleotides of the 17X174 single-stranded bacteriophage, completing a fully sequenced DNA-based genome. Improvements to the Plus and Minus methods resulted in the chain termination, or Sanger method, which forms the basis of the most widely used technique of DNA sequencing, genome mapping, data storage, and bioinformatics analysis in research 25 years later.

In its most general form, algebra is the study of mathematical symbols and the rules for manipulating these symbols; algebra is the unifying thread of almost all areas of mathematics. In addition, algebra includes everything from solving basic equations to studying abstractions such as groups, rings, and fields. The more basic parts of algebra are called elementary algebra, while the more abstract parts of algebra are called abstract algebra or modern algebra. Elementary algebra is generally considered essential for any study of mathematics, science, or engineering, as well as applications in medicine and economics. Abstract algebra is a major topic in advanced mathematics, studied primarily by professionals and mathematicians. Elementary algebra differs from arithmetic in its use of abstraction, such as using letters to represent unknown numbers or being allowed to take multiple values. For example, in x+2=5{\\displaystyle x+2=5} the letter x{\\displaystyle x} is unknown, but the law of inversion can be used to find the value: x=3{\\displaystyle x=3}. In E = mc2, the letters E{\\displaystyle E} and m{\\displaystyle m} are variables, and the letter c{\\displaystyle c} is a constant, the speed of light in a vacuum. Algebra provides a method for solving equations and expressing formulas that is easier (for those who understand the concept) than the conventional method of writing everything down in words. The word algebra is also used in more specific cases.

This vocabulary entered the English language during the fifteenth century, either from Spanish, Italian, or Medieval Latin. Algebra was originally called the surgical procedure for setting a bone fracture or dislocation. Its mathematical meaning was first recorded in the 16th century. The word \"algebra\" has several meanings in mathematics, as a single word or with qualifications. Algebra begins with the same calculations as arithmetic, with letters used to represent numbers. This allows proof of the properties to be true regardless of the numbers involved. For example, in the quadratic equation a,b,c{\\displaystyle a,b,c} can be any number (except that a{\\displaystyle a} cannot be 0{\\displaystyle 0}), and the quadratic formula can be used for with quickly and easily find the values \u200b\u200bof the unknown quantity x{\\displaystyle x} and satisfy the equation. The quadratic formula is used to represent the equation, and then find all the solutions to the equation. Historically, and in teaching today, the study of algebra begins by solving equations such as the quadratic equation above. Then come more general questions, such as \"does the equation have a solution?\", \"how many solutions does the equation have?\", \"what can be said about the nature of the solution?\". These questions sparked ideas about shape, structure and symmetry. The structural properties of these non-numeric objects are then abstracted to define algebraic structures such as groups, rings, and fields. Prior to the 16th century, mathematics was divided into two subfields, arithmetic and geometry. Although some methods, which were developed much earlier, may be considered today as algebra, the emergence of algebra and, soon after, infinitesimal calculus as a subfield of mathematics is only from the 16th or 17th century.",

Semipelagianism is contrary to the previous teachings of Pelagianism, in which humans are seen as the only thing that affects their own salvation, which has been rejected and seen as heresy. Semipelagianism in its original form developed as a compromise between Pelagianism and the teachings of the Church Fathers such as Saint Augustine, who taught that humans cannot come to God without grace or mercy from God. In the view of Semipelagianism, it is therefore necessary to distinguish between the initial stages of faith and the development of faith; where the second half stage \u2014 growing in faith \u2014 is the work of God, while faith in the initial stage is an act of free will and grace only comes into play afterward.

Therefore, man must act, so that he can receive salvation. However, humans have weaknesses and limitations, so humans need outside help, namely God's grace. Nevertheless, humans must desire it and whoever wishes it will obtain salvation. The salvation referred to here is a result of cooperation between God and man.

Pelagianism is a teaching that says that humans have the ability to seek God in and of themselves apart from all actions of God or the Holy Spirit, and therefore salvation is only a human endeavor. This doctrine is taken from the name of Pelagius, an English monk who was accused of developing this doctrine (in his own letters he seems to claim that humans do not do good apart from grace or mercy, only, all humans have free will as a gift from God); its teachings were opposed, in particular, by Augustine of Hippo and declared a heresy by Pope Zosimus in 418. Pelagianism denied the existence of original sin, teaching that man is in himself and by nature capable of choosing what is good. Semipelagian thought teaches that humans do not have an unlimited ability, but humans and God can work together to a certain degree in this effort of salvation: humans can (without the help of grace) take the first step to come to God, then God increases and maintains that faith. , then complete His work of salvation. This teaching differs from the traditional patristic (age of the Church Fathers) doctrine of synergism (synergeia), in which the process of salvation is cooperation between God and man from beginning to end. The term \"Semipelagianism\" was unknown in ancient times, appearing for the first time only in the last quarter of the 16th century.

Coal tar, which contains about 1.5% anthracene, is the main source of this material. Common impurities are phenanthrene and carbazole. The classic laboratory method for the preparation of anthracene is the cyclodehydration of o-methyl- or o-methylene-diarylketone known as the Elbs reaction. Anthracena is also present in the interstellar medium. More than 20% of the carbon in the universe can be associated with PAHs, including anthracenes. Anthracene undergoes photochemical dimerization under the influence of UV light: The dimeric compounds, called dianthracenes (or sometimes parantracenes), are linked via new carbon-carbon bond pairs, resulting in a +4] cycloaddition. It can be reverted to anthracene thermally or by UV radiation below 300 nm. Substituted anthracene derivatives have similar properties. The reaction is affected in the presence of oxygen. Reduction of anthracene with alkali metals gives the dark colored anion salt radical M+anthracene]- (M = Li, Na, K). Hydrogenation yields 9,10-dihydroanthracene, while retaining its ring-ring aromaticity.

Asoka was the first ruler of Ancient Bharata (India), after the illustrious Mahabharata rulers, to unite this vast territory under his empire, which even exceeded the boundaries of the sovereign territory of present-day India. The British writer H. G. Wells wrote of Ashoka: \"In the history of the world, there have been thousands of kings and emperors who called themselves 'Their Highnesses', 'Their Royal Highnesses' and 'Their Royal Highnesses' and so on. They shone for a brief period, and then quickly disappeared. However, Asoka still shines and shines brilliantly like a brilliant star even today\" (Originally in English: \"In the history of the world there have been thousands of kings and emperors who called themselves 'Their Highnesses', 'Their Majesties' and 'Their Exalted Majesties' and so on. They shone for a brief moment, and as quickly disappeared. But Ashoka shines and shines brightly like a bright star, even unto this day\"). Asoka was the son of maharaja Maurya, maharaja Bindusara from a concubine of rather low rank and named subhadrangi who was eventually called Dharma because he followed the path of righteousness. Ashoka had several brothers and only one younger brother, Drupadh. Because of his exemplary intelligence and ability for war, he is said to have been the favorite grandson of his grandfather, maharaja Chandragupta Maurya.",

So while he developed into a consummate accomplished warrior and a shrewd statesman, Asoka commanded several Mauryan army regiments. His growing popularity throughout the empire made his older brothers jealous as they feared he could be chosen by Bindusara to become the next emperor. Her brother is the oldest, Susima prince, crown prince of the first, to persuade Bindusara to send Asoka to deal with a rebellion in the town of Taxila, in the northwestern province of Sindhu, where the prince Susima was governor. Taxila is an area that is volatile because the population is the Greek-Indian people who like to fight and also because the government of his older brother, Prince Susima, is chaotic. Therefore, in this area many formed militias security screw. Asoka agreed and left for the area which was being hit by the turmoil. So when the news that Asoka is coming to visit them with his troops, he was greeted with respect by the rebel militia and insurgency could be ended without bloodshed. (This province later rebelled again when Asoka ruled, but was then crushed with an iron fist). Asoka's success made his brothers more and more anxious about his intention to become the next emperor, so Susima's instigations towards Bindusara made him throw Ashoka away. Ashoka then goes to Kalinga and hides his identity. There he meets a fisherwoman named Kaurwaki, and he falls in love. Newly discovered inscriptions indicate that she was to become a second or third consort consort. In the meantime, there is a rebellion again, this time in Ujjayani (Ujjain). Maharaja Bindusara invites Asoka back after being exiled for two years.",

APEC was founded in 1989 in response to the growing economic interdependence of Asia-Pacific countries and the emergence of other trading blocs in other parts of the world; fear of Japan dominating economic activity in the Asia-Pacific region, and of establishing new markets for agricultural products and raw materials outside Europe. Headquartered in Singapore, APEC is recognized as the oldest forum and highest level multilateral bloc in the Asia-Pacific region, and exerts significant global influence. The annual APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting is attended by the heads of government of all APEC member countries except for Taiwan (which is represented by a ministerial-level official named Chinese Taipei as chief economist). The location of these meetings rotates annually among member countries, and as a tradition, which is followed by almost all meetings, every head of government attending wears the traditional dress of the host country. APEC has three official observers: the Secretariat of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council and the Secretariat of the Pacific Islands Forum. In January 1989, Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke proposed establishing more effective economic cooperation for the Asia-Pacific region. This culminated in the first APEC meeting in the Australian capital, Canberra, chaired by Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans. The meeting was attended by ministers from 12 countries, and culminated in a commitment to hold annual meetings for the future in Singapore and South Korea. Countries from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) opposed the initial proposal, and instead proposed an East Asian Economic Caucus that excluded non-Asian countries such as the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.",

Clinton hopes that this will continue the stalled Uruguay Round negotiations. During the meeting, several leaders called for the continued reduction of trade and investment barriers, and envisioned a vision of a community in the Asia-Pacific region that can promote prosperity through cooperation. Finally, a central APEC Secretariat was established in Singapore to coordinate the activities of the organization. At the 1994 meeting in Bogor, Indonesia, APEC leaders adopted the Bogor Goals (Indonesian: Bogor Goals) aimed at encouraging open trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific starting in 2010 for industrialized economies and 2020 for developing economies. In 1995, APEC established a business advisory body called the APEC Business Advisory Council (ABAC), which consists of three business executives from each member country. In April 2001, APEC, in collaboration with five other international organizations (Eurostat, IEA, OLADE, OPEC and UNSD) launched the Joint Oil Data Exercise, which in 2005 became the Joint Organization Data Initiative (JODI).

Confucianism is considered a religion that emerged as a result of the political situation in Indonesia during the New Order era. It is common for Confucianism to have its meaning and essence obscured as a philosophy or way of life. Confucius considered himself a transmitter of cultural values \u200b\u200binherited from the Xia (c. 2070\u20131600 BC), Shang (c. 1600\u20131046 BC) and Western Zhou (c. 1046\u2013771 BC) dynasties. Confucianism was suppressed during the legalist and autocratic Qin dynasty (221\u2013206 BC), but persisted. During the Han dynasty (206 BC\u2013220 AD), the Confucian approach ruled out the Huang\u2013Lao \"proto-Taoist\" as the official ideology, while the emperors mixed the two with realist Legalist techniques. Confucianism appears in the form of religion in several countries such as Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong and China. In Chinese, Confucianism is often referred to as Kongjiao (\u5b54\u6559) or Rujiao (\u5112\u6559). Confucianism as a religious institution in Indonesia implements the following. The Year of the Confucian Prophet's New Year falls on December 22. February 4th turn of winter to spring. So Chinese New Year is not a spring celebration.

Every 4 or 5 years there is a 13th month, to fulfill it so that the calculation does not change. Needs to be explained] In this era The New Order, the Soeharto government prohibited all forms of activities that smelled of Chinese culture and traditions in Indonesia. This has caused many adherents of Chinese traditional beliefs to have no status as adherents of one of the 5 recognized religions. To avoid political problems (accused of being atheists and communists), adherents of these beliefs are then required to embrace one of the recognized religions, the majority being followers of Buddhism, Islam, Catholicism, or Christianity.",

Confucian teachings in Chinese, the original term is Rujiao (\u5112\u6559), which means the belief of people who are meek, educated and virtuous. Confucius was not the creator of this belief, but he only perfected the belief that existed long before his birth, as he said: \"I am not the creator, but I like these ancient teachings.\" Although people sometimes think that Confucianism is a philosophical teaching to improve morale and maintain human ethics, actually if someone wants to understand Confucianism correctly and completely, then he will know that in Confucianism there are also rituals that must be carried out by its adherents. Confucianism also teaches about how the relationship between humans or called \"Ren Dao\" and how we make a relationship with the creator of the universe (Tian Dao) which is called \"Tian\" or \"Shang Di\". This philosophical teaching was founded by Confucius who was born in 551 BC under the name Chiang Tsai who was then 17 years old. He was known for the spread of new sciences when he was 32 years old, Confucius wrote many moral, historical, literary and philosophical books which were widely followed by adherents of this teaching. He died in 479 BC. Confucius did not prevent the Chinese from worshiping sacred things and guardians but only those that were worthy of worship, not worshiping sacred objects or guardians that were not worthy of worship.

Today, the term Celtic is also used to describe some of the inhabitants of the British Isles, the Brittany region of France, and the Galician region of Spain who retain some of the original Celtic features, particularly of their language. However, in the past they were not considered related to the Celts by outsiders. The term 'Celtic' comes from the name of the Ancient Greeks. In written references to the Celtic people, Hecataeus of Greece in 517 BC refers to them as Keltoi. However, European historical literature before the 19th century never mentions \"Celtic\" or \"Celtic\". The mention of the present comes from archaeological findings which show the migration of Celtic people from Gaul and Belgium to the British Isles, such as Atrebates, Menapii, and Parisi, and played a role in the formation of the Celtic population. A clear feature of the Celts is that they are either spoken or descended from speakers of one of the Celtic languages. The territories of Wales, the Isle of Ireland, Scotland, Cornwall, the Isle of Man and Brittany are called \"the land of the Celts\" because their inhabitants speak languages \u200b\u200bbelonging to the Celtic languages.

Intercourse may be preceded by fondling which causes arousal in the partner, causes the penis to experience an erection, and natural lubrication of the vagina. To initiate intercourse, the erect penis is inserted into the vagina and one partner or both partners move their thighs to make the penis move back and forth in the vagina and produce friction, without fully extending the penis. Thus, they stimulate themselves and their partners until orgasm and ejaculation are obtained. Penile penetration is also known as \"intromission\" or by the Latin name \"immissio penis\". The term \"penetration\" is used to describe the condition when the male genitalia is inserted into the vagina. This is not always a mandatory ritual to achieve pleasure and enjoyment in sex. Sexual activity without penetration is usually carried out by teenagers by masturbating so that sperm is released. Copulation is the basic method of human reproduction. During ejaculation, which is commonly accompanied by orgasm in men, a series of muscle contractions occur which send semen containing the male gametes known as sperm cells or spermatozoa into the vaginal space.",

A total of 118 elements have been identified, of which 94 occur naturally on Earth. While the remaining 24, is a synthetic element. There are 80 elements that have at least one stable isotope and 38 elements that are radionuclides which, over time, decay into other elements. Iron is the most abundant constituent of the earth (by mass), while oxygen is the most abundant in the earth's crust. Chemical elements make up the ordinary matter in the universe. However, astronomical observations suggest that ordinary observable matter makes up only 4% of the matter in the universe: the rest is dark matter (73%); its composition is unknown, but it is not composed of any chemical elements. This mysterious energy is likely accelerating the inflation of the Universe. The two lightest elements, hydrogen and helium, were formed mostly in the Big Bang and are the most common elements in the universe. The next three elements (lithium, beryllium, and boron) were formed mostly by cosmic ray spallation, and are therefore rarer than the heavier elements. The formation of elements with between 6 and 26 protons occurs and continues in main sequence stars through stellar nucleosynthesis. The high abundance of oxygen, silicon and iron on Earth reflects their abundant production in these stars. Elements with more than 26 protons form via supernova nucleosynthesis within supernovae, which, when they explode, scatter these elements as supernova remnants far into space, which coalesce with planets when they form. The term \"element\" (or \"element\") is used for atoms with a certain number of protons (regardless of whether they are ionized or chemically bonded, e.g. hydrogen in water) or for chemically pure substances containing a single element (e.g. hydrogen gas).",

A single element can form many substances that differ in structure; they are called allotropes of elements. When different elements combine chemically, with atoms held together by chemical bonds, they form chemical compounds. Only a few elements are found uncombined as pure minerals. Such naturally occurring elements include copper, silver, gold, carbon (as coal, graphite, or diamond), and sulphur. All elements, except for very inert ones such as the noble gases and noble metals, are normally found on earth in their combined chemical forms, as chemical compounds. While about 32 chemical elements exist on Earth in natural uncombined forms, the vast majority exist as mixtures. For example, atmospheric air mixes primarily with nitrogen, oxygen, and argon, while the naturally occurring solid elements occur in metal alloys, such as iron and nickel. The history of the discovery and use of elements began with primitive human societies who discovered natural elements such as carbon, sulfur, copper and gold. Later civilizations extracted the elements copper, tin, lead and iron from their ores through smelting, using coal. Alchemists and chemists successively identified many more; all naturally occurring elements were known by 1950.

Before pursuing a pharmacist professional education, one must first take a bachelor of pharmacy education to obtain an academic degree of bachelor of science (S.Sc.) or bachelor of pharmacy (S.Farm.) which are generally taken within four years. After that, then a bachelor can continue his professional pharmacist education (apt.) which is generally achieved within one year. So, the total time it takes someone to become a pharmacist is five years. The concept of this education is similar to what someone goes through to become a doctor, where after obtaining a bachelor's degree in medicine (S.Ked. ), they must continue their education for young doctors or co-assistant to obtain a doctor's degree (dr.). In clinical practice, pharmacists act as supervisors over prescriptions issued by doctors. As a profession that studies medicines in depth, starting from how they are made to how these drugs give certain reactions to the body, pharmacists actively review, correct, and provide input to doctors and other medical teams in providing therapy to patients. In carrying out the practice of pharmacy, pharmacists wear ivory white coats. This is different from doctors who wear bone-white coats while practicing medicine. In Indonesia, only pharmacists and doctors wear formal attire, such as suits. The terms pharmacist and apothecary originate from the physician Claudius Galenus of Pergamum (129\u2013199) who is commonly known as Galen. He named the place where he examined patients latron and the place where Galen stored medicines apotheca, which literally means warehouse. In 1240, the state of the Kingdom of Sicily passed laws for the first time separating the professions of physicians and pharmacists.",

Generally concentrations to choose from include Industrial Pharmacy, and Clinical and Community Pharmacy. Pharmacists with a concentration in Industrial Pharmacy will be well-suited to work in the pharmaceutical industry in various fields such as regulatory affairs, quality assurance, quality assurance, production, distribution, and others.

The Paleozoic comes after the Neoproterozoic Era of the Proterozoic, and is followed by The Mesozoic Era.The Paleozoic was a time of dramatic changes in geology, climate, and evolution.The Cambrian period saw the most rapid and extensive diversification of life in Earth's history, known as the Cambrian explosion, in which the first modern phyla appeared.Fish, arthropods, amphibians, reptiles, and synapsids all evolved in the Paleozoic era.Life started in the sea but eventually migrated to land, and during the late Paleozoic, the earth was dominated by various organic forms me. Gigantic plantations of primitive plantations covered the continent, many of which later formed coal seams stretching from Europe to eastern America. Towards the end of the era, large and advanced reptiles became dominant and the first modern plants (conifers) appeared. The Paleozoic era ended with the largest mass extinction in Earth's history, the Permian-Triassic extinction event. The effects of this catastrophe were so devastating that it took life on land 30 million years, into the Mesozoic era, to recover. The recovery of life in the sea is thought to be much faster. In North America, the era began with deep sedimentary basins along the east, southeast, and west sides of the continent, while the interior (called the interior landmass) was dry land. As the era progressed, the coastal seas periodically eroded parts of the interior landmass, leaving behind deposits of sediment that marked their \"attacks\".",

Beginning in the Ordovician Period, occasional mountains formed in the eastern Appalachian region and continued for the remainder of the era, bringing in new sediments. Sediments scoured from the Acadia Mountains, filled the western Appalachian basin and formed the famous coal marshes of the Carboniferous Period. In North America, the term Carbonifera is rarely used. Instead, time is divided between the Mississippian and Pennsylvania periods because of differences in the sedimentary rocks deposited during those eras. The Mississippian period is characterized by limey sediment deposited in shallow seas, usually with many crinoidal fossils, such as in the Burlington Formation. Whereas the Pennsylvania period is generally characterized by terrestrial sediments such as sand, shale and most importantly: coal. Most of the oil and gas can be obtained from the sediments of Pennsylvania. Whereas in places where this has been moved, such as in the uplands of the Ozarks, there is usually no oil. Paleoclimatological studies and evidence of glaciers suggest that Central Africa was most likely in the polar regions at the start of the Paleozoic. At the start of the Paleozoic, the continents of Gondwanaland were already forming or are currently forming. In the mid-Paleozoic, North America and Europe collided producing the Acadian-Caledonian uplifts, and the eastern Australia subduction zone was uplifted. In the late Paleozoic, the collision of the continents formed the supercontinent Pangaea and produced many major mountain chains, including the Appalachian, Ural, and Tasmanian mountains. There are six periods of the Paleozoic era: Cambrian, Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous and Permian. The Cambrian Period lasted from 541 to 485 million years ago and is the first period of the Paleozoic era. The Cambrian sparked an explosion in the evolution of life in an event known as the Cambrian Explosion, in which the greatest number of living things evolved in Earth's history in a single period.",

Until 1990, Turkmenistan was still part of the Soviet Union's constitution, which was called the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic. Turkmenistan is located in Central Asia and is bordered by Iran to the south, Afghanistan to the southeast, Uzbekistan to the north, Kazakhstan to the northwest and the Caspian Sea to the west. Most of its territory is a stretch of the Karakum desert. The country has the fifth largest natural gas reserves in the world. Currently, Turkmenistan operates a single-party political system. This system is considered not to meet the basic principles of democracy. Since its independence from the Soviet Union, Turkmenistan was led by Saparmurat Niyazov and even called himself Turkmenbashi (Turkmenistan: T\u00fcrkmenba\u015fy, which means \"Leader of all Turkmens\"). In 2022, he died and was replaced by Serdar Berdimuhamedow who was appointed by the Turkmenistan State Security Council through the general election on 11 February 2007. The Turkmenistan region has long been known to many people in history. Many troops from various kingdoms were sent to this region, in order to get a more prosperous region. This region has long been known primarily by the various Persian empires. The history of this region begins when the Achaemenid Emperor (the first ancient Empire of Persia) conquered this region and divided it into three regions, Margiana, Khwarezmia, Parthia. Alexander the Great conquered the region in the IV century BC on his way to Central Asia, and it was during this time that the Silk Road was established as the main trade route connecting Asia and the Mediterranean Basin. Several centuries later, the Persian Parthian Empire founded and established its capital at Nisa (UNESCO World Heritage Site in Turkmenistan), which today is about 18 km to the southwest of Ashgabat.",

In the mid-11th century the Seljuk Turkic Empire concentrated its territorial power in Turkmenistan in an attempt to expand its empire into Khorasan. In the mid-XII century, the power of the Seljuk Turkish Empire fell, which was defeated by Genghis Khan, who at that time succeeded in seizing power in the eastern region of the Caspian Sea in the context of his journey to the west. Seven centuries later, the Turkmens live under the rule of various empires and wars between tribes. Around the XVII and XIX centuries AD, power in Turkmenistan was contested by the Persian Empire, the Khiva Khanate, the Emirs of Bukhara, and the rulers of Afghanistan. During this time, the spiritual leader of the Turkmens, Magtymguly Pyragy was noted for his efforts to maintain freedom and autonomy for his people. At that time, vast areas of Central Asia, including Turkmenistan, were uncharted and barely known to Europeans and the Western World. The competition for control of the territory between the British Empire and the Russian Tsarist Empire was marked by the Great Games. Throughout their conquest of Central Asia, the Russians were met with the stiffest resistance by the Turkmens.

        "paragraph": "In science and engineering, the notation of parts per set of pseudo units is used to describe small values \u200b\u200bof various dimensionless quantities, such as mole fraction or mass fraction. Since these fractions are measures of quantity per quantity, they are pure numbers with no units of measurement associated. Commonly used are parts per million (ppm, 10\u22126), parts per billion (ppb, 10\u22129), parts per trillion (ppt, 10\u221212) and parts per quadrillion (ppq, 10\u221215). This notation is not part of the International Unit (SI) system and its meaning is ambiguous. The per part notation is often used to describe dilute solutions in chemistry, for example, the relative abundances of dissolved minerals or pollutants in water. The quantity \"1 ppm\" may be used for the mass fraction if the water-borne pollutant is present in one millionth of a gram per gram of sample solution. When dealing with aqueous solutions, it is usually assumed that the density of water is 1.00 g/mL. Therefore, it is customary to equate 1 kilogram of water with 1 liter of water. Consequently, 1 ppm corresponds to 1 mg/L and 1 ppb corresponds to 1 \u00b5g/L. Similarly, the per part notation is also used in physics and engineering to express the values \u200b\u200bof various proportional phenomena. For example, a special metal alloy can expand 1.2 micrometers per meter of length for every degree Celsius and this would be expressed as \"\u03b1 = 1.2 ppm/\u00b0C\". The per part notation is also used to indicate change, stability, or uncertainty in a measurement. For example, the accuracy of a ground survey distance measurement when using a laser rangefinder may be 1 millimeter per kilometer of distance; this can be expressed as \"Accuracy\u00a0=\u00a01\u00a0ppm.\" The per part notation is all dimensionless quantities: in mathematical expressions, the units of measurement always cancel.",

However, they generally take the literal meaning of \"parts per\" of comparative ratio (eg \"2 ppb\" would generally be interpreted as \"two parts in a billion parts\"). The per part notation can be expressed in the same unit of measure. For example, the expansion coefficient of a certain brass alloy, \u03b1 = 18.7 ppm/\u00b0C, can be expressed as 18.7\u00a0(\u03bcm/m)/\u00b0C, or as 18.7\u00a0(\u03bcin/in)/\u00b0C; a numeric value representing the relative proportions does not change with the application of different units of length. Similarly, metering pumps that inject chemicals into the main process line at a proportional flow rate Qp = 125 ppm, do so at rates that can be expressed in various volumetric units, including 125 \u03bcL/L, 125 \u03bcgal/gal, 125 cm3/m3, etc. In nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, the chemical shift is usually expressed in ppm. It represents the difference in frequency measured in parts per million of the reference frequency. The reference frequency depends on the magnetic field of the instrument and the element being measured. Usually expressed in MHz. Typical chemical shifts are rarely more than a few hundred Hz from a reference frequency, so chemical shifts are easily expressed in ppm (Hz/MHz). The per part notation gives a dimensionless quantity that is independent of the strength of the instrument field.

        "paragraph": "Radioactive decay (also known as nuclear decay or radioactivity) is the ability of unstable atomic nuclei to become stable through emission of radiation. This ability involves the process of splitting unstable atomic nuclei resulting in a loss of energy (in the form of mass in silence) by emitting radiation, such as alpha particles (helium nuclei), beta particles (electrons or positrons) with neutrinos and gamma rays. Materials containing unstable nuclei are considered radioactive. Decay occurs in a parent nucleus and results in a daughter nucleus. Radioactive decay is a \"random\" (stochastic) process in which, according to quantum theory, it is impossible to predict when an atom will decay, no matter how long the atom has existed. However, for a collection of atoms, the predicted decay rate can be characterized by a decay constant or half-life. This forms the basis for radiometric measurements. The half-life of a radioactive atom has no limit, spanning 55 magnitude levels, from almost spontaneously beginning to far exceeding the age of the universe. The international (SI) unit for measuring radioactive decay is the becquerel (Bq) after the French physicist Henri Becquerel. If a radioactive material produces 1 decay event every 1 second, then the material is said to have an activity of 1 Bq. Because normally a sample of radioactive material contains many atoms, 1 becquerel will appear to be a low level of activity; The units commonly used are on the order of gigabecquerel. In addition, another unit used to measure radioactive decay is the curie (Ci). This unit is based on the amount of radiation produced by one gram of radium. One curie (Ci) is equivalent to 3.7 \u00d7 1010 Bq. The neutrons and protons that make up the atomic nucleus, seen like other particles, are governed by several interactions.",

Coulomb's law or electrostatic force also has a significant role in this measure. The weak nuclear force has little effect on this interaction. The gravitational force also has little effect on the nuclear process. Changes in the arrangement of particles and or changes in the type of particles cause complex interactions between these forces. This interaction can then lead to a release of energy. This is because the stability of the nucleus is limited when it undergoes transformation. This event might be described like the sand towers we build on the beach: even though the friction that occurs between the sands is able to support the tower's height, the tower is unstable, given its low potential energy. Therefore, a \"disruption\" is needed that can change the tower to a higher level of entropy. The disturbance causes the system to produce energy which is then distributed to all parts resulting in a collapse. The collapse of this tower then becomes an analogy of the decay process. The tower collapse (decay) requires a certain activation energy. Disturbances that occur in the tower come from outside the system, either in the form of being kicked or shifted by the hand. In the case of nuclear decay, the activation energy comes from quantum fluctuations. The nucleus, like a tower, is unstable, so it continues to stabilize itself by trying to get as close to the ground state as possible. Some nuclear reactions involve an external source of energy, in the form of \"collisions\" with external particles, for example. However, such a reaction is not considered decay. Reactions like this will usually be included in nuclear fission/nuclear fusion.

        "paragraph": "In chemistry, methylation denotes the addition (addition) of a methyl group to a substrate, or the replacement (substitution) of an atom (or group) by a methyl group. Methylation is a form of alkylation, with a methyl group instead of a long carbon chain replacing a hydrogen atom. These terms are commonly used in chemistry, biochemistry, soil science, and biological sciences. In biological systems, methylation is catalyzed by enzymes; Such methylation can be involved in heavy metal modification, gene expression regulation, protein function regulation, and RNA processing. In vitro methylation of tissue samples is also one method to reduce stained histological artifacts. The opposite of methylation is called demethylation. In biological systems, methylation is achieved by enzymes; Methylation can modify heavy metals, regulate gene expression, RNA processing and protein function. This has been recognized as a key process underlying epigenetics. Methanogenesis, the process that produces methane, is the result of a series of methylation reactions. These reactions are influenced by a series of enzymes harbored by the anaerobic microbial family. Various phenols undergo O-methylation to produce anisole derivatives. This process, catalyzed by enzymes such as cafeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase, is a key reaction in the biosynthesis of lignol, the precursor to lignin, the main structural component of plants. Plants produce flavonoids and isoflavones by methylation at hydroxyl groups, i.e. methoxy bonds. This 5-O-methylation affects the solubility of flavonoids in water. Examples are 5-O-methylgenistein, 5-O-methylmyricetin or 5-O-methylquercetin, also known as azaleatine. Methionine synthase regenerates methionine (Met) from homocysteine \u200b\u200b(Hcy). The overall reaction converts 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (N5-MeTHF) to tetrahydrofolate (THF) while transferring the methyl group to Hcy to form Met. Methionine synthase can be both cobalamin dependent and cobalamin independent: plants have both, animals depend on the methylcobalamin-dependent form. In the methylcobalamin-dependent enzyme form, the reaction proceeds in two steps in the ping-pong reaction.",

Then, Hcy coordinates with enzyme-bound zinc to form a reactive thiolate which reacts with Me-Cob. The activated methyl group is transferred from Me-Cob to Hcy thiolate, which regenerates Co(I) in Cob, and Met is released from the enzyme. Biomethylation is a pathway for converting some heavy elements into more mobile or lethal derivatives that can enter the food chain. Biomethylation of arsenic compounds begins with the formation of methanarsonate. Thus, the trivalent inorganic compound arsenic is methylated to give methanarsonate. S-adenosylmethionine is a methyl donor. Methanarsonate is the precursor to dimethylarsonate, again by a reduction cycle (to methylarsonic acid) followed by a second methylation. Related pathways apply to methylmercury biosynthesis. The term methylation in organic chemistry refers to the alkylation process used to describe delivery of a CH3 group. Methylation is generally carried out using an electrophilic methyl source such as iodomethane, dimethyl sulfate, dimethyl carbonate, or tetramethylammonium chloride. Less common but more potent (and more dangerous) methylating reagents include methyl triflate, diazomethane, and methyl fluorosulfonate. All of these reagents react via nucleophilic SN2 substitution. For example, a carboxylate can be methylated in oxygen to give a methyl ester; an alkoxide salt RO\u2212 may also be methylated to give an ether, ROCH3; or the ketone enolate can be methylated on the carbon to give a new ketone. Purdie methylation is specific for methylation at oxygen on carbohydrates using iodomethane and silver oxide. The Eschweiler\u2013Clarke reaction is a method for methylation of amines. This method avoids the risk of quaternization, which occurs when amines are methylated with methyl halides.",

Lions are on the continent of Africa and part of India. Lions are animals that live in groups. Usually consists of one male & many females. This group guards its territory. Lions live between 10 and 15 years in the wild, but in captivity it is possible to be more than 20 years. The younger lion will usurp the leadership from the older lion. Most younger lions will eat the cubs of the previous leader. The female lion is much more active in hunting, while the male lion is more relaxed in waiting and asking for rations from the prey of the females. Male lions are believed to be superior and mighty compared to other big cats, but the lion's weakness is that they cannot climb trees as well as other big cats. Male lions grow thick fur around the nape, this is more beneficial for protecting the nape, especially in free fights between big cats which tend to pounce on the nape to immobilize their enemies. Other big cats, such as cheetahs and leopards, are much smaller than lions. Even though they come from the same family as tigers, lions don't like water. Unlike the tiger who likes water. In the past, lions lived throughout Africa, Europe, the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent. But now the lion's habitat is only in a small part of the Indian subcontinent and Africa. It happened because of poaching aiming to get the skin. Based on archaeological findings from the pictures on the walls, around 15,000 years ago it was estimated to have lived in Europe, and 5,000 years ago to have existed in Greece.",

The weight of newborn lion cubs is around 1.2 kg to 2.1 kg. The lion's habitat is on the prairie. This animal is classified as nocturnal, in a day 20 hours lying on rocks or under a shady tree. Each group consists of 1\u20136 males, 4\u201315 females. The territory of one group is between 20\u2013400 km2. If the food runs out, the lioness looks for food all day while expanding her territory. The task of the male lion is to protect the female from the male lions of other groups, and guard the territory. When occupying another group's territory, the male that takes possession of another group will kill the lion cubs that are in the captured group. The running speed of a male lion is 58 km/hour.

It can be seen as an atomic scale web consisting of carbon atoms and their bonds. The name graphene comes from GRAPHITE + -ENE; Graphite itself consists of many graphene sheets stacked together. In 2010, Andre K. Geim and Konstantin Novoselov won the Nobel Prize in chemistry for their work on developing 2-dimensional graphene. The carbon-carbon bonds in graphene are about 0.142 nm. Graphene is the basic element of carbon allotropes, including graphite, carbon nanotubes, and fullerene. Graphene can also be considered as a very large aromatic molecule, which is a group of flat polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon compounds. In 2004 a research group from the Massachusetts institute of technology led by Andre K. Geim and Konstantin Novoselov discovered a semiconductor material called \"Graphene\". This material, which is an allotrope of carbon, has a thickness of only one atom and is stronger than steel, namely carbon arranged sideways in a lattice resembling a honeycomb (Section 6) and is estimated to be the thinnest semiconductor material in the world. Single layers of graphite earlier (circa 1910s) were grown epitaxially over other materials and are commonly called \"epitaxial graphene\". Epitaxial graphene contains a one-atom thick hexagonal layer with sp2 bonds between the carbon atoms. In the process of growing graphene crystals, charge transfer occurs from the substrate to epitaxial graphene, and in some cases hybridization of the d orbitals of the substrate atoms with the pi orbitals of graphene occurs, which significantly changes the electronic structure of graphene.",

If there are isolated pentagonal cells, the plane will contract to a conical shape. The insertion of 12 pentagons will form a fullerene. Similarly, the insertion of isolated heptagon cells causes the sheet to become saddle-shaped. The controlled addition of pentagons and heptagones allows the formation of various complex shapes, for example carbon nanobuds. A single-walled carbon nanotube can be thought of as a graphene cylinder whose fraction has a hemispherical cap (involving 6 pentagons) at each end. It has been considered that small fragments of graphene sheets are produced (along with other flakes) when graphite is rubbed off, for example when drawing lines with a pencil. However, physicists from the University of Manchester and the Institute for Microelectronics Technology, Chernogolovka, Russia were the first to isolate and study graphene (rather than polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) in 2004.

Planar graphene itself has been thought to not exist in the free state, being unstable due to the formation of curved structures such as soot, fullerene, and nanotubes.

Studies in this field have been carried out for thousands of years although significant progress was made only in the 18th century. In the 19th century, a major breakthrough occurred after coordinated observations were made across countries. After the development of computers in the mid-20th century, weather forecasting became possible. Meteorological phenomena are weather activities that can be observed and explained by the science of meteorology. These activities are tied to variables in the Earth's atmosphere, such as temperature, air pressure, water vapor, and the interaction gradients of each variable and how they change over time. Spatial differences are studied to determine how weather systems form locally, regionally, and globally and their impacts. Meteorology, climatology, atmospheric physics and atmospheric chemistry are subdisciplines of atmospheric science. Meteorology and hydrology form the interdisciplinary field of hydrometeorology. Meteorology has many applications in various fields, such as military, energy production, transportation, agriculture, and construction. The word \"meteorology\" comes from the ancient Greek words, met\u00e9\u014dros \"majestic; high (in the sky)\" (from \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1- meta- \"above\" and \u1f10\u03c9\u03c1 e\u014dr \"raised\") and -\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1 -logia \"-(o)logy\" \"knowledge\".

Humans have been trying to predict the weather informally since thousands of years ago and formally since the 19th century. Weather forecasts are made by collecting quantitative data about the current state of the atmosphere using scientific understanding of atmospheric processes to project how the atmosphere is changing. In the past, weather forecasting relied heavily on changes in air pressure, current weather conditions, and sky conditions, weather modeling is now used to determine future conditions.",

Nebulas are made of many things (and of different kinds). Most nebulae form as emission nebulae. Emission nebulae containing ionized gases are called Region H II. Nebulae like this form when a newly formed star ionizes the gas around it, creating an emission nebula. Examples of Region H II are the Orion Nebula and NGC 604. There are also nebulae formed from Supernova and Nova explosions. The nebula that formed from the supernova is called the Supernova Remnant. An example of a supernova remnant is the Crab Nebula. And the nebula formed from the results of the nova is called the remnants of a nova (Nova Remnant). An example of a nova remnant is GK Persei (otherwise known as Nova Persei 1901). Nebulae are often also formed from stars like the Sun as they are on their way to death, the White dwarf stage. This nebula is known as a planetary nebula. This nebula is formed when a star like the Sun runs out of fuel. This causes the star to continue to grow until finally it blows its stellar wind on a large scale, causing it to lose its mass. The stellar wind then forms a Planetary Nebula and the star becomes a White Dwarf.

In meteorology, visibility (English: visibility) is defined as \"the farthest distance at which an object can still be seen clearly\". Far or near visibility is determined by how many particles are above the air, the more particles, the shorter the visibility. These particles can be water droplets, dust particles, etc. In English terms, fog (fog) is a cloud that is on the surface of the ground which contains millions of very small water droplets. Fog consists of water droplets, but under certain conditions it can be accompanied by ice crystals. In general, fog is defined as a condition with visibility less than 200 m, and dense fog is a condition with visibility less than 50 m. At sea, the understanding is different. Fog is a condition with a visibility of less than 1000 m, and dense fog is a condition with a visibility of less than 200 m. In the English sense, Fog and Mist are both formed by very small water droplets that gather in the air. The difference between the two is in the density of the water droplets. Fog is thicker than mist, because fog contains more water droplets. In a fog, water vapor near the ground condenses and becomes a cloud. This is usually formed because the cold makes water vapor condense and the humidity level is close to 100%. There are several types of fog: Formed by the advection of wet air over a cooler surface. Sometimes the formation of advection fog is strengthened by the cooling of the earth's surface caused by the earth's radiation at night.",

Since then, they have fought for independence to govern Australia on their own, free from British control. Until recently, Australia was part of the British Commonwealth.

Originally, taxonomy referred only to the categorization of living things. However, in a broader and more general sense, taxonomy can also refer to the categorization of objects or concepts, as well as the principles that underlie this categorization. Many taxonomies have a hierarchical structure, but this is not a requirement. The taxonomy uses a unit known as a taxon (plural: taxa). Higher taxa are more general, while lower taxa are more specific. Taxonomy is different from menonomy, which deals with the categorization of parts of the whole. In biology, taxonomy is also a separate branch of science that studies the classification or systematics of living things. The system used is a two-name nomenclature, known as the binomial nomenclature proposed by Carl von Linne (Latin: Carolus Linnaeus), a Swedish naturalist. He introduced seven hierarchies (levels) to classify living things. The seven hierarchies (which are called taxons) successively from the highest level (general) to the lowest (specific) are: In binomial nomenclature, the name of a species is sufficient only to mention the surname (always starting with a capital letter) and the type designator (always starting with in lowercase) in italics (printed upright if the main text is italicized) or written in underlined. This rule should not be confusing because surnames cannot be the same for other higher taxa levels. Further development of knowledge forced the creation of a new taxon among the six existing ones (using the prefixes 'super-' and 'sub-').

But more often than not, sultan is used to refer to the head of a Muslim monarch who rules over an Islamic state. In modern times, the title sultan is often equated with caliph, although there are some fundamental differences between the two titles. Khalifah is a title for the leader of all Muslims (regardless of being a leader hierarchically or simply symbolically), while the sultan is the ruler of a Muslim country, so he is not the leader of the Muslims who are in his territory. The two titles are often equated, perhaps because the Ottoman rulers held the titles caliph and sultan simultaneously for around four centuries, blurring the boundaries of the roles of the two positions. The sultan is also often equated with the king (\u0645\u0644\u0643, malik). Although both refer to the head of the monarchy, the sultan has Islamic religious connotations in it so that they cannot be completely equated. In international usage, sultan is usually not translated as 'king' in various local languages, but is absorbed as is.

The title of sultan was first given by Caliph Al-Mu'tashim (ruled 833 - 842) from the Abbasid Dynasty to a Turkish Muslim commander named Asynas at-Turki. As a sultan, Asynas at-Turki had great power, but he remained subordinate and subservient to the Caliph al-Mu'tashim. In this period, the sultan played the role of an amir, which is equivalent to the governor and caliph as the head of state and government of a large empire. In its course, the caliphate's political power dwindled and the sultan de facto became independent. Even so, these sultans still acknowledge submission to the caliph symbolically. After Baghdad was destroyed by the Mongol attack in 1258, the political power of the caliph disappeared so that the caliph after this only acted as a leader of the Muslim community completely symbolic, and more in a religious context than a government like the previous period. With such a situation, each sultan officially became the highest leader in his respective territory. Thus, the sultan can be equated with a king or emperor. This situation continued after the caliphate was dissolved in 1924. Currently, the sovereign countries whose head of state bears the title of sultan are Oman and Brunei Darussalam. In addition to being used by rulers from sovereign countries such as the Ottoman and Mamluk Sultanates, sultan is also used for the head of a monarchy whose country is officially subordinate to another country.

From the 10th century, Bhutan's political development was heavily influenced by its religious history. Various sub-sects of Buddhism arose which were patronized by various Mongolian and Tibetan overlords. After the collapse of the Mongols in the 14th century, these sub-sects vied with each other for supremacy in the political and religious landscape, eventually leading to the rise of the sub-sect Drukpa in the late 16th century. Until the 17th century, Bhutan existed as warring fiefdoms until it was unified by the Tibetan lama and military leader Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyal. To defend his country from occasional Tibetan encroachments, Namgyal built a network of impregnable dzongs (fortresses), and promulgated codes of laws that helped bring local kings under centralized control. Many of those dzongs still exist. After Namgyal's death in 1651, Bhutan fell into anarchy. Taking advantage of the confusion, the Tibetans invaded Bhutan in 1710, and returned in 1730 with the help of the Mongols. Both attacks were thwarted, and an armistice was signed in 1759.

Historically, its usage in Christian religious circles has carried derogatory connotations and usually refers to a movement that adheres to beliefs or teachings that are heretical and which often deviate from orthodox teachings and practices. In the Indian context, sect refers to an organized tradition. The word sect comes from the Latin term secta (from sequi, to follow), which means (1) a course or course of life, (2) a code of conduct or basic principles, (3) a school of philosophy or doctrine. Sectarius or sectilis also refers to cutting, but this meaning, contrary to popular opinion, is not related to the etymology of the word. Sectator is a leader or staunch believer. citation needed] Sectarianism is sometimes defined in the sociology of religion as a worldview that emphasizes the unique legitimacy of believers' creeds and practices and that increases tensions with the wider society through their actions building on these practices. -practice that defines its dividing line. Conversely, a religious or political cult also has high tension with the surrounding community, but its beliefs are within the context of that society's context, even though it is new and innovative. While cults are able to impose their norms and ideas on their members, sects usually do not have \"members\" with strict obligations, but only followers, sympathizers, supporters, or adherents. Mass-based socialist, social-democratic, workers' and communist parties often had their origins in utopian sects, and thus also produced many sects, which broke away from their mass parties. In particular the communist parties from 1919 underwent various schisms, some of which can be called sects of the parentage.",

According to Wallis, \"sects claim to have a unique and privileged access to truth or salvation and \"their staunch adherents usually regard everything outside the boundaries of their collectivity as 'erroneous.'\" He contrasts this with cults which he describes as having the hallmark of \"epistemological individualism.\" This means that \"a cult has no clear locus of supreme authority outside its individual members.\" Axel Michaels, an indologist, writes in his book on Hinduism that in the Indian context the word \"sect does not denote any schism or an isolated community, but rather an organized tradition, usually founded by a founder who engages in ascetic practices.\" And according to Michaels, \"The Indian sects do not focus on heresy, for there is no center or center demanding make this impossible.

This practice is based on developing sensitivity and acceptance through relaxing the body, feelings and mind. The goal is to create space within oneself, mind and solitude, which is needed to achieve a state of serenity to realize one's identity. Sumarah was formed by a man named Raden Ngabei Soekinohartono (Kino) who lived in Wirobrajan, Yogyakarta. One night, on September 8, 1935 he received a revelation in the form of light, and a dialogue took place which the members of the Sumarah Association believed was God Almighty, which contained teachings from Sumarah. From that revelation, Kino began to slowly spread his teachings to those closest to him since 1935. He didn't have the courage to openly build this group because he could be taken away by the Dutch. After the Dutch finally left the country, Kino and some of his followers began to spread their teachings outside of Yogyakarta.

The higher the kebatinan level, the easier it will be to get a blank mind which is the way to communicate with God Almighty. Sumarah did not have a book, but the management of the Sumarah Association created a guide containing Kino's thoughts and the elaboration of his revelations. Although it is a sect similar to religion, followers of Sumarah do not want to call this sect a religion. This is done because there are also adherents of Sumarah who are followers of the religion and continue to carry out the two worship services together without any conflict, because in essence sumarah is surrender completely to God. Most of the adherents who still have that religion are interested in worship and also how to get closer to God from Sumarah. Finally, they participate in worship by prostrating and then emptying their minds so they can reach the highest point of spirituality. It needs to be explained and emphasized here that Sumarah is one of the manifestations of the Indonesian Human Divinity Culture, especially Java.

The country's capital city, Valletta, with an area of \u200b\u200babout 08 km2 (3.1 sq mi), is the smallest capital city in the European Union. Malta has one national language, Maltese, and English as the official language. Malta's strategic location in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea has made Malta important in history. Malta has been used as a naval base, and a series of powers such as Phoenician, Carthaginian, Greek, Roman, Byzantine, Moorish, Norman, Sicilian, Spanish, Order of Saint John, French and English have ruled Malta. In 1942, King George VI of England presented Malta with the Cross of Saint George for that country's bravery during World War II.

Malta has a long history of Christian heritage and the Archdiocese of Malta was declared one of the apostolic succession, because according to the Acts of the Apostles, the Apostle Paul was shipwrecked in \"Melita\", which the people said was Malta. The official religion in Malta is Catholicism. Malta is renowned as a popular tourist destination especially for Europeans, with a warm climate, various recreational areas and historical and architectural monuments. Some of the famous monuments are three UNESCO World Heritage Sites: Hypogeum \u0126al Saflieni, Valletta and seven megalithic temples, some of which are the oldest freestanding structures in the world.

The origin of the term Maltese is unclear and modern variations of the word are taken from Maltese. The most common etymology is that the word Maltese comes from the Greek word \u03bc\u03ad\u03bb\u03b9, meli, 'honey'. The ancient Greeks named the island \u039c\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03b7 (Melit\u0113) which means 'sweet honey', probably because Malta produces its unique honey from a unique species of bee that lives on the island. The Romans later called the island Melita, which can be seen as a Latinization of the Greek word \u039c\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03b7 or as an adaptation of the Greek Doric dialect pronunciation of the same word \u039c\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03b7.

        "paragraph": "Parmenides was a philosopher from the Elea School. The meaning of the name Parmenides is \"Stable steadfastness\", or \"Stable appearance\". Within the Elean School, Parmenides is the most famous figure. His philosophical thinking was in conflict with Herakleitos because he held that everything \"that is\" does not change. Parmenides wrote his philosophy in poetic form. There are hundreds of lines of Parmenides' poems that are still preserved today. Parmenides' poem consists of a foreword and two parts. The two sections are respectively entitled \"The Way of Truth\" and \"The Way of Opinion\". The preface and the \"Way of Truth\" are stored in full, namely 111 verses. The second section, \"The Way of Knowledge\", contains only 42 verses. Parmenides was born in 540 BC and died in 470 BC. He comes from the city of Elea, Southern Italy. He comes from a wealthy and respectable family in Elea. Parmenides also drafted a constitution for Elea. He was a student of Xenophanes, but did not share his teacher's views. Xenophanes' influence on Parmenides was only in the use of poetry in conveying his philosophy. Apart from that, he was also heavily influenced by Ameinias, a member of the Pythagorean school. According to Plato's testimony, Parmenides once visited Socrates in Athens with Zeno, his student. At that time, Socrates was still young while Parmenides was 65 years old. The main essence of the \"Way of Truth\" is the belief that \"only 'that which is' exists\". Parmenides does not define what is meant by \"that which is\", but mentions its properties. According to Parmenides, \"that which is\" is all-encompassing, does not move places, does not change, and is not destroyed. In addition, \"that which is\" is also unshakable and undeniable. According to Parmenides, \"that which is\" is an undeniable truth. If someone denies it, then he will fall into contradiction.",

Second, one could say that \"that which is\" and \"that which is not\" exists together. Both of these assumptions are impossible. The first supposition is impossible, because \"which is not\" cannot be thought of and cannot be spoken of. \"That which is not\" cannot be thought of and spoken of. The second supposition is the view of Herakleitos. This supposition is also impossible, because the second supposition accepts the first supposition, that \"that which is not there\" exists, even though the first supposition proves impossible. Thus, the conclusion is \"That which is not there\" does not exist, so that only \"what is\" can be said to exist. To better understand Parmenides' thought, the following example can be used. Let's say someone says \"God doesn't exist!\" Here, God whose existence people deny actually exists, that is to say, he must be accepted as \"the one who exists\". This is because if that person says \"God doesn't exist\", then that person has already thought of a concept about God. Only after that, the concept of God that that person thought was refuted by himself by stating \"God does not exist\". Thus, God as that person thinks \"exists\" even if only in his own mind. Meanwhile, the rejection of something, surely presupposes that something \"exists\" so that \"that which does not exist\" is not possible. Because \"that which is\" can always be said and thought, in fact Parmenides equates \"that which is\" with thinking or reason. After arguing about \"that which is\" as truth, Parmenides also stated the consequences: Parmenides' thought opened a new chapter in the history of Greek philosophy. It can be said that he was the founder of metaphysics, the branch of philosophy which investigates \"that which is\".",

Sugar as sucrose is obtained from sap, sugar cane, sugar beet, or palm sugar. However, there are other minor sources of sugar, such as coconut. Other sources of sweeteners, such as dahlia tubers, grapes, or corn kernels, also produce some sweeteners but are not composed of sucrose as the main component.

Dunkleosteus originated in the United States in Devonian times and lived in temperate and deep waters rich in prey such as amphibians, crustaceans, molluscs and even other fish. Dunkleosteus is one of the largest predatory fish on Earth. They can grow to around 5-9 meters in length and weigh 4-6 tonnes, larger than the Great White Sharks from South Africa and Australia which are now recognized as the largest predatory fish. This size was large for the fish of its time, even Dunkleosteus was the largest animal of its time. This fish has bones similar to sharks, but there is a shield of bone plates that cover and protect the head up to part of the back, gills and chest. This shield makes Dunkleosteus difficult to attack on vital parts. Its eyes are protected by circular bony ridges and what is most striking is that this fish has no teeth. In its place were several sharp bone blades like a very sharp axe, which would interlock when the mouth was closed. The blades of these bones sharpen each other when they are adrift, keeping them sharp and never dull. Dunkleosteus is described as a brutal predator who attacked almost anything smaller than his body. This fish goes not too fast because it is heavy-but strong. It can open its jaws by pulling back, causing a powerful suction force that pulls objects in front of it, then cuts the prey's body in half with the bony blade in its mouth.",

Then a Spanish sailor named Francisco Pizarro arrived in the Inca Empire and civil war began. Atahualpa agreed to accept Spanish help against Huascar onwards. Through trickery, the Spanish gained control of the port in Cajamarca, and captured Atahualpa during the Battle of Cajamarca and held him ransom and demanded a sum of gold for his release. While still in custody, Atahualpa planned the assassination of his older brother Huascar in Cusco. Then Spain succeeded in taking control of the Inca Empire.

This term is probably first used by Pythagoras (c. 570\u2013495SM). The methods used in philosophy include asking questions, critical discussion, dialectics, and systematic presentations. Classical philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know everything and prove it? What's the most real? Philosophers also ask more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be fair or unfair (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will? Historically, philosophy encompasses the core of all knowledge. From the time of Ancient Greek philosophers such as Aristotle until the 19th century, natural philosophy encompassed astronomy, medicine, and physics. For example, Newton's Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy in 1687 is later classified as a physics book. In the 19th century, the development of modern university research ushered in professionalized and specialized academic philosophy and other disciplines. In the modern era, several investigations that were traditionally part of philosophy have become separate academic disciplines, some of which are psychology, sociology, linguistics, and economics. Other investigations closely related to art, science, politics and several other fields remained part of philosophy. For example, is beauty objective or subjective? Are there many scientific methods or is there only one? Is political utopia a hopeful dream or a vain delusion?

It is a soft, silvery, malleable and ductile metal, valued for its magnetic, electrical, chemical, and optical properties. It is too reactive to be found in its native form, and pure praseodymium metal slowly develops a green oxide layer when exposed to air. Praseodymium always occurs naturally along with other rare earth metals. It is the sixth most abundant rare earth element and the fourth most abundant lanthanide, making up 9.1 parts per million of the Earth's crust, an abundance similar to boron. In 1841, Swedish chemist Carl Gustav Mosander extracted a rare earth oxide residue he called didymium from a residue he called \"lantana\", which in turn separated from cerium salts. In 1885, Austrian chemist Baron Carl Auer von Welsbach separated didymium into two elements giving salts of different colors, which he named praseodymium and neodymium. The name praseodymium comes from the Ancient Greek \u03c0\u03c1\u03ac\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 (prasinos), meaning 'green lilac', and \u03b4\u03af\u03b4\u03c5\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 (didymos) 'twin'.

Oxidation numbers 0, +1, and +2 are rare. Aqueous praseodymium ions are yellowish-green in color, and similarly, praseodymium gives various yellow-green tones when it is placed in glass.

It is a ductile metal with a hardness comparable to silver. Its 59 electrons are arranged in the Xe]4f36s2 configuration; Theoretically, the five outermost electrons can act as valence electrons, but their use requires extreme conditions and typically, praseodymium releases only three or occasionally four electrons in its compounds. Like most of the other metals in the lanthanide series, praseodymium usually only uses three electrons as valence electrons, because after that the remaining 4f electrons are too tightly bound: this is because the 4f orbital penetrates most of the xenon's inert electrons into its core, followed by 5d and 6s, and this increases with higher ionic charge. However, praseodymium can continue to lose its fourth and sometimes even fifth valence electron because it arrives very early in the lanthanide series, where the nuclear charge is still low enough and the energy of the 4f subshell is high enough to allow further loss of valence electrons. Thus, similar to the other early trivalent lanthanides, praseodymium has a crystal structure of double hexagon solid arrangement at room temperature. At about 560 \u00b0C, it transitions to a face-centered cubic structure, and a body-centered cubic structure appears just before its melting point, 935 \u00b0C. Praseodymium, like all the other lanthanides (except lanthanum, ytterbium, and lutetium, which lack an unpaired 4f electron), is paramagnetic at room temperature. Unlike some other rare earth metals, which exhibit antiferromagnetism or ferromagnetism at low temperatures, praseodymium is paramagnetic at all temperatures above 1 K.

The Emakhandzambili clan was originally incorporated into the kingdom with broad autonomy, often including the granting of special rituals and political status. However, their degree of autonomy was drastically limited by Mswati, who attacked and subdued some of them in the 1850s.

These people who arrived later became known to the Swazi people as Emafikamuva. The Swazi state autonomy was influenced by British and Dutch rule in southern Africa in the 19th and early 20th centuries. In 1881, the British government signed a convention recognizing the independence of the Swazis, even though the Scramble for Africa was taking place at the time. This independence was also recognized in the London Convention of 1884. Between 1875 and his death in 1889, King Mbandzeni created a complex pattern of land ownership by granting Europeans many concessions. These included grants and leases for farming and grazing. The concessions covered most of the Mbandzeni kingdom, but most of it reserved for the king his rights as sovereign and did not allow the holders to encroach on the rights of the Swazi living in the land.

Ethanol is included in the single-chain alcohol, with the chemical formula C2H5OH and the empirical formula C2H6O. Ethanol is a constitutional isomer of dimethyl ether. Ethanol is often shortened to EtOH, where \"Et\" stands for the ethyl group (C2H5). The fermentation of sugar into ethanol is one of the earliest organic reactions ever carried out by humans. The intoxicating effects of ethanol consumption have also been known for a long time. In modern times, ethanol intended for industrial use is often produced from ethylene. Ethanol is widely used as a solvent for various chemicals intended for human consumption and use. Examples include perfumes, flavourings, food coloring and pharmaceuticals. In chemistry, ethanol is an important solvent as well as a feed stock for the synthesis of other chemical compounds. In its history, ethanol has long been used as a fuel. Ethanol has been used by humans since prehistoric times as an intoxicant in alcoholic beverages. Residues found on ceramic remains dating back 9000 years from northern China indicate that alcoholic beverages were used by prehistoric humans from the Neolithic period. Ethanol and alcohol form an azeotropic solution. Therefore purification of ethanol containing water by means of ordinary distillation is only capable of producing ethanol with a purity of 96%.

In 1828, Michael Faraday succeeded in making ethanol from the acid-catalyzed hydration of ethylene. This process is similar to the modern industrial ethanol synthesis process. Ethanol has been used as a lamp fuel in the United States since 1840, but taxes imposed on industrial alcohol during the American Civil War made its use uneconomical. This tax was abolished in 1906, and since 1908 Ford Model T automobiles could be run on ethanol.

Ethanol is a colorless volatile liquid with a characteristic odor. It burns smokelessly with a blue flame that is sometimes invisible in ordinary light. The physical properties of ethanol are mainly influenced by the presence of hydroxyl groups and the shortness of the ethanol carbon chains. The hydroxyl groups can participate in hydrogen bonds, making them liquid and more difficult to evaporate than other organic compounds of the same molecular mass.

The teachings of Arius and his supporters regarding the nature of the Trinity and the nature of Christ are in fact contrary to the theological views held by Homoousian Christians. The Arian concept of Christ is based on the belief that the Son of God does not always exist, but is begotten in time by God the Father, and therefore Jesus is not as eternal as God the Father. A dispute occurred between the two interpretations (Arianism and Homoousianism) which were both based on the orthodox theology of the time, each trying to solve its theological dilemma. Thus, from the beginning these two equally orthodox interpretations deliberately provoked conflict in order to attract the attention of experts and formulate new orthodox teachings. Homoousianism was officially confirmed as the correct interpretation by the first two Ecumenical Councils. The First Council of Nicaea in 325 declared Arianism a heresy. All major sects in Christianity today consider Arianism to be heterodox and heretical. According to Everett Ferguson, \"Most Christians do not really understand the doctrines of the Trinity and do not understand the issues at stake.\" In the first regional Synod of Tire in 335, Arius was found innocent. Constantine the Great was baptized by an Arianist bishop, Eusebius of Nicomedia.",

Emperors Constantius II (337\u2013361) and Emperor Valens (364\u2013378) were either Arianists or Semi-Arians, as were The first king of Italy, Odoacer (433?\u2013493), and the Lombards until the 7th century. The term Arianism is also used as a designation for 4th century anti-Trinitarian theological teachings, which regard Jesus Christ\u2014the Son of God, the Logos\u2014as a begotten being (similar to the teachings of Arianism and Anomoeanism) or as an uncreated being. nor was it created as other creatures were created (as was the case with Semi-Arianism). Arius had been a student of Lucian of Antioch at Lucian's private school at Antioch, and from him he inherited a modified form of Paul's teaching of Samosata. He taught that God the Father and God the Son did not co-exist in eternity from the beginning. The Arians taught that the Logos (Word) was a divine being created by God the Father before the creation of the world, making him the instrument through which all things were created, and that the Son of God was subordinate to God the Father. A verse from the Book of Proverbs is also used by them as a reference: \"The LORD has created me as the beginning of His work, as His first work long ago\" (Proverbs 8:22). Therefore, the Son is considered more as the first and most perfect creature of God's creation, and is made \"God\" solely with the permission and power of the Father. The controversy surrounding Arianism arose in the late 3rd century and lasted most of the 4th century. It involved most members of the church\u2014from parishioners, priests, and monks, to bishops, emperors, members of the Roman imperial family. Two Roman emperors, Constantius II and Valens, were either Arians or Semi-Arians, as were the warlords of the Goths, Vandals and Lombards (Lombards), both before and after the fall of the Western Roman Empire.",

It is a notoriously toxic metalloid material and has three allotropic forms; yellow, black, and gray. Arsenic and arsenic compounds are used as pesticides, herbicides, insecticides and in various alloys. Arsenic has chemical characteristics similar to Phosphorus, and can often be used as a substitute in various biochemical reactions and is also toxic. When heated, arsenic rapidly oxidizes to arsenic oxide, which smells like garlic. Arsenic and some arsenic compounds can also directly sublimate, changing from a solid to a gas without first becoming a liquid. Arsenic is found in two solid forms which are yellow and metallic in color, with specific gravity of 1.97 and 5.73. The word arsenic is borrowed from the Persian \u0632\u0631\u0646\u064a\u062e Zarnik which means \"yellow orpiment\". Zarnik is borrowed in Greek as arsenicone. Arsenic has been known and used in Persia and in many other places since ancient times. It was often used to kill, and the symptoms of arsenic poisoning were difficult to explain, until the invention of the Marsh test, a sensitive chemical test for the presence of arsenic. Because it is often used by rulers to get rid of their opponents and because of its extraordinary killing power and difficulty to detect, arsenic is called the Poison of kings, and King of all poisons. In the Bronze Age, arsenic was often used in bronze, which made the alloy harder. Warangan, which is often used as a coating material for keris surfaces, contains the main ingredient arsenic. Arsen evokes the prestige of the keris by emphasizing the contrast on the prestige. In addition, arsenic also increases the lethality of the stabbing weapon. Albertus Magnus is credited with being the first to discover how to isolate this element in 1250.",

During Queen Victoria's time in Great Britain, arsenic was mixed with vinegar and lime and eaten by women to improve the appearance of their faces, making their skin lighter to show that they were not working in the fields. Arsenic was also rubbed on women's faces and arms to whiten their skin. However this is highly discouraged now. Some places on earth contain arsenic high enough to seep into groundwater. WHO sets the highest safe threshold for arsenic in groundwater at 50 ppb (parts per billion). Most of the areas with the highest arsenic content are alluvial areas which are river silt deposits and soils rich in organic matter. It is estimated that around 57 million people drink groundwater contaminated with excess arsenic, making it potentially toxic. Arsenic in groundwater is naturally occurring, and is released from sediments into groundwater due to the absence of oxygen in the subsurface layer. This groundwater began to be used after a number of western NGOs researched large well water programs in the late 20th century, but failed to find the presence of arsenic in the groundwater. It is considered to be the worst mass poisoning in history and possibly the worst environmental disaster in history. In Bangladesh there is an epidemic of mass poisoning caused by arsenic. Many other countries in Asia, such as Vietnam, Cambodia, Indonesia and Tibet, are thought to have similar geological environments conducive to producing groundwater containing high levels of arsenic.

In the original sense, this structure was embedded by historians in the political system in Europe in the Middle Ages, which placed knights and other noble classes (vassals) as rulers of certain areas or rights (called fiefs or, in Latin, feodum) appointed by monarchy (usually a king or lord). The term feudalism itself has been used since the 17th century and was never used by the actors themselves. Since the 1960s, historians have broadened the use of this term to include aspects of the social life of land workers on land controlled by landlords, giving rise to the term \"feudal society\". Because the use of the term feudalism has increasingly had a negative connotation, its critics now consider this term not helpful in clarifying the situation and are advised not to use it without clear qualifications. In everyday language use in Indonesia, this word is often used to refer to behaviors similar to those of tyrannical rulers, such as 'old-fashioned', 'always wanting to be respected', or 'holding on to old values \u200b\u200bthat have been many abandoned'.

Hammurabi led his armies against Akkadia, Elam, Larsa, Mari and Summeria, bringing the Babylonian Empire almost as large as the ancient Egyptian Empire under the Pharaoh Menes, who had unified Egypt over a thousand years earlier. Although Hammurabi fought many wars conquering other kingdoms, he is more famous because during his reign the first recorded official code (written law) in the world was created, which is known as the Hammurabi Charter (Codex Hammurabi). In 1901, archaeologists discovered the charter while excavating under the ruins of the former ancient city of Susa, Babylon. Hammurabi's charter is engraved on a flattened piece of rock in cuneiform. There are 282 laws in total in the Charter, but 32 of them are fragmented and difficult to read. It contains arrangements for certain criminal acts and their rewards. Some examples of its contents include: Currently, Hammurabi's Charter has been kept and exhibited for the general public at the Louvre Museum in Paris, France. Hammurabi besides being a king, was also a religious leader of the Babylonian people. Thus, Hammurabi's Charter was an official rule enforced by Babylonian society and government. It is thought that in the past the published laws were made into charters (in the form of inscriptions) and shown to the general public for approval. So laws are not made by the government solely to suit its own opinion.

Kyrgyzstan's history spans over 2,000 years. Covers various cultures and kingdoms. Historically Kyrgyzstan was at the crossroads of several major civilizations, namely as part of the Silk Road and other commercial and cultural routes. Kyrgyzstan was under foreign domination and achieved sovereignty as a nation-state after the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. After independence, Kyrgyzstan has officially become a sovereign country, although ethnic conflicts persist, rebellions, economic problems, transitional governments and political party conflicts. Kyrgyzstan is a member of the Commonwealth of Independent States, Eurasian Economic Union, CSTO, Shanghai Cooperation Organization, Organization of Islamic Cooperation, Turkish Council, T\u00dcRKSOY community and United Nations (UN). Ethnic Kyrgyz make up the majority of the country's 5.7 million people, followed by significant minorities of Uzbeks and Russians.

This gray-white transition metal is dense, malleable, ductile, highly unreactive, and valuable. Its name comes from the Spanish word platinum, which literally translates to \"little silver\". Platinum is a member of the platinum group elements and is an element in group 10 of the periodic table. It has six naturally occurring isotopes. This metal is one of the rarest elements in the earth's crust with an average abundance of about 5 \u00b5g/kg. It occurs in several nickel and copper ores along with several natural deposits, mostly in South Africa, which accounts for 80% of world production. Due to its scarcity in the earth's crust, only a few hundred tons are produced annually, and for its important uses, it is highly valuable and a major precious metal commodity. Platinum is the least reactive metal. Its amazing resistance to corrosion, even at high temperatures, has earned it the title of noble metal. Consequently, platinum is often found as a naturally occurring element. Because it occurs naturally in the alluvial sands of rivers, it was first used by the indigenous people of pre-Columbian South America to make artifacts. European writings refer to the 16th century, but the report of Antonio de Ulloa who published a new metal in Colombia in 1748 became the object of research by scientists. Platinum is used in catalytic converters, laboratory equipment, electrical contacts and electrodes, platinum resistance thermometers, dental equipment, and jewelry. Because it is a heavy metal, platinum has health problems when exposed to its salts, but because of its resistance to corrosion, platinum is not as toxic as some other metals.

This metal reacts violently with fluorine at 500\u00b0C (932\u00b0F) to form tetrafluoride. The metal is also attacked by chlorine, bromine, iodine and sulfur. Platinum is insoluble in hydrochloric and nitric acids, but dissolves in hot aqua regia to form chloroplatinic acid, H. Its physical properties and chemical stability make it useful for industrial applications. Its resistance to wear and stains makes it suitable for use in jewelry. The most common oxidation states of platinum are +2 and +4. The +1 and +3 oxidation states are less common, and are sometimes stabilized by metallic bonds in bimetallic (or polymetallic) species. As expected, tetracoordinated platinum(II) compounds tend to adopt a 16-electron planar quadrilateral geometry. Although elemental platinum is usually unreactive, it dissolves in hot aqua regia to form chloroplatinic acid (H): As a weak acid, platinum has a great affinity for sulfur, as for dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO); a number of DMSO complexes have been reported and the choice of reaction solvent must be made with great care.

America has been thinking about launching orbiting satellites since 1946 under the Bureau of Aeronautics of the United States Navy (Bureau of Aeronautics of the United States Navy). The US Air Force's Project RAND eventually issued the above report, but did not suggest that the satellite had potential as a military weapon; however, they regard it as a tool of science, politics, and propaganda. In 1954, the US Secretary of Defense stated, \"I am not aware of any American satellite programs.\"",

Following pressure from the American Rocket Society, the National Science Foundation, and the International Geophysical Year, interest in the armed forces increased and in early 1955 the U.S. Air Force and Navy worked on Project Orbiter, which used the Jupiter C probe to launch satellites. The project was a success, and Explorer 1 became America's first satellite on January 31, 1958. In June 1961, three and a half years after Sputnik 1's launch, the U.S. Air Force made use of facilities from the United States Space Surveillance Network. to catalog a total of 115 satellites orbiting the earth. The largest man-made satellite currently orbiting the earth is the International Space Station. A satellite is an object in space that rotates following the earth's rotation. Satellites can be distinguished based on their shape and uses, such as: weather satellites, communication satellites, science and technology satellites and military satellites. To be able to operate the satellite is launched into orbit with the help of a rocket. Developed countries such as the United States, Russia, France and recently China, already have stations to launch satellites into orbit. There are three kinds of satellite positions in their orbits, namely, all satellite movements are monitored from the earth or better known as control stations. The way the satellite works is by way of uplink and downlink. Uplink is the transmission sent from the earth to the satellite, while downlink is the transmission from the satellite to the earth station.",

Anaximenes was a contemporary of the two philosophers, although he was younger than Anaximander. He is mentioned in the Western philosophical tradition, along with Thales and Anaximander, as a member of the Miletus School. Anaximenes was a friend, student, and successor of Anaximander. Like the other two Miletus philosophers, he spoke of natural philosophy, that is, what is the basic principle (arche) of all things. Anaximenes believed that air was the origin of the world. This is because it is air that pervades all of nature and air is also the basis of life for humans, which is very necessary for breathing. For him soul is air, fire is diluted air, and air when condensed becomes water; if it is compacted again it becomes soil and finally becomes stone. About his life history, not much is known. Anaximenes rose to fame around 545 BC, while the year of his death is estimated to be around 528/526 BC. He is known to be younger than Anaximander. He wrote one book and from that book only one fragment is still preserved today. One of the difficulties in accepting Anaximander's philosophy of metaphysical to apeiron is how to explain the interplay between the metaphysical and the physical. For this reason, Anaximenes no longer saw something metaphysical as the basic principle of everything, but returned to a physical substance, namely air. Unlike water, which is not found in fire (Thales thought), air is a substance that is present in all things, whether water, fire, humans, or everything else. Therefore, Anaximenes argued that air is the basic principle of all things. Air is the substance that causes all things to exist, have appeared, or will appear as some other form.",

On the other hand, when air is diluted, fire appears. This condensation and dilution encompasses all natural occurrences, as water can turn into ice and vapor, and how all other substances are formed from the combination of air changes.The formation of the universe according to Anaximenes is from the condensation and dilution of air which forms water, earth, rock, and etc. The earth, according to Anaximenes, is flat, broad, and thin, almost like a table. The earth is said to be suspended in the air as a leaf is suspended in the air. Heavenly bodies such as the moon, stars, and sun are also suspended in the air and revolve around the earth. These celestial bodies are fire in the sky, which appears due to the moist breath of earth. Stars do not produce heat because they are far from Earth. When the stars, moon, and sun are not visible at night, it is because they hide behind high parts of the earth as they orbit the earth. Then clouds, rain, snow, and other natural phenomena occur due to air compaction. The human soul is seen as just a collection of air. The proof, humans need to breathe to survive. The soul is what controls the body and keeps everything in the human body moving as it should. Because it is useful for maintaining the continuity of the soul and body. Here, Anaximenes posits the similarities between the human body and the universe based on the same basic unitary principle, namely air. The theme of the body as a microcosm (small universe) which reflects the universe as a macrocosm is a theme that will often be discussed in Greek Philosophy.",

Followers of this theory are referred to as Marxists. Marxism includes dialectical materialism and historical materialism and their application to social life. Marxism is the basis of the theory of modern communism. This theory is contained in the book The Communist Manifesto written by Marx and Friedrich Engels. Marxism is a form of Marx's protest against capitalism. He considers that capital collects money at the expense of the proletariat. The condition of the proletariat is very sad because they are forced to work long hours with minimum wages, while the results of their work are only enjoyed by the capitalists. Many proletarians have to live in the suburbs and slums. Marx argued that this problem arose because of \"private ownership\" and control over wealth which was dominated by the rich. In order to prosper the proletariat, Marx believes that the understanding of capitalism needs to be replaced with the understanding of communism. If this condition continues, according to Marx, the proletariat will rebel and demand justice. This is the basis of marxism. Marxism is a system of thought that combines three intellectual traditions which were still highly developed at that time, namely German philosophy, French political theory, and English economics. Marxism cannot simply be categorized as \"philosophy\" like other philosophies, because it contains a major philosophical dimension and even exerts a tremendous influence on many subsequent philosophical thoughts. That is why it is impossible to ignore it in the history of modern philosophy. In putting forward this theory, Marx was heavily influenced by Hegel. Even today, Marxists still use Hegel's terminology. It would be a good idea to mention here one by one the ideas of Hegelianism which are also an important content of Marxism: From these ten similarities, an increasingly complex material quantity can turn into a new quality.",

The name Cambrian comes from Cambria which is the Latin name for the area of \u200b\u200bWales where parts of this period were first studied. The Precambrian time span makes up nearly 88% of the Earth's total geological time. The Precambrian is an informal unit of geological time, which is divided into three eons (Hadean, Archean, Proterozoic). This division of the period stretches from the formation of the earth, which is about 4.6 billion years ago (Ga) to the beginning of the Cambrian period, which is about 542 million years ago (Ma), when living things with hard shells first appeared. The movement of the Earth's tectonic plates causes the formation and breakdown of continents and land masses over time. This movement sometimes forms supercontinents which are the largest or all of the largest and most contributing groups of existing terrestrial masses. Vaalbara was the first known supercontinent, which formed 3.636 billion years ago from a collection of proto-continents. Vaalbara went through a split some 2.845\u20132.803 Ga ago. Then, the Kenorland supercontinent formed around 2.72 Ga ago and then split apart at 2.45\u20132.1 Ga into proto-craton proto-continents called Laurentia, Baltica, Yilgarn Craton and Kalahari.

It is the lightest of the halogens and occurs under standard conditions as a very toxic pale yellow diatomic gas. As the most electronegative element, it is highly reactive, as it reacts with all other elements except argon, neon and helium. Among all the elements, fluorine ranks 24th in universal abundance and 13th in terrestrial abundance. Fluorite, the principal mineral source of the fluorine which gives the element its name, was first described in 1529; because it was added to a metal ore to lower its melting point in order to make smelting easier, the Latin verb fluo meaning 'to flow' gave the mineral its name. Proposed as an element in 1810, fluorine proved difficult and dangerous to separate from its compounds, and several early researchers died or suffered injuries as a result of their experiments. It wasn't until 1886 that the French chemist Henri Moissan isolated elemental fluorine using low-temperature electrolysis, a process still used for modern production. Industrial production of fluorine gas for uranium enrichment, its greatest application, began during the Manhattan Project in World War II. Due to the high cost of purifying pure fluorine, most commercial applications use fluorine compounds, with about half of the fluorite mined being used in steelmaking. The remaining fluorite is converted to corrosive hydrogen fluoride on its way to various organic fluorides, or to cryolite, which plays a key role in aluminum refining. Molecules containing carbon\u2013fluorine bonds often have very high chemical and thermal stability; their main uses are as refrigerants, insulating electrical and cookware, and PTFE (Teflon).

The fluorine atom has nine electrons, one fewer than neon, and the electron configuration is 1s22s22p5: two electrons in the inner shell that are filled and seven in the outer shell that require one more to be filled. The outer electrons are ineffective at shielding the core, and experience a high effective nuclear charge of 9 \u2212 2 = 7; this affects the physical properties of the fluorine atom. The first ionization energy of fluorine is the third highest of all the elements, behind helium and neon, which complicates the removal of electrons from the neutral fluorine atom. It also has a high electron affinity, second only to chlorine, and tends to gain electrons to be isoelectronic with the noble gases neon; it has the highest electronegativity of any element. The fluorine atom has a small covalent radius, about 60 picometers, similar to that of its neighbors in the same period, oxygen and neon. note 1] The bond energy of difluorine is much lower than that of Cl2 or Br2 and is similar to that of a peroxide bond that is easily cleaved; this, together with high electronegativity, leads to easy fluorine dissociation, high reactivity, and strong bonding with nonfluorine atoms.",

In 1894 B.C.E., the Amorites established a small sovereign state that also included the administrative city of Babylon. During the time of the Akkadian Empire (2335\u20132154 BC), Babylon was just a small city in one of its tributaries. This situation changed during the time of the Old Babylonian Empire. Babylon During Hammurabi's reign, Babylon was enlarged and made the capital. Throughout and after Hammurabi's reign, Babylonia was called \"Land of the Akkadians\" (Akkadian: M\u0101t Akkad\u012b) in memory of the former glory of the Akkadian Empire. In the Christian Bible and the Hebrew Bible/Tanakh, the two countries of Babylon and the capital city of Babylon are referred to as Babylon, or simply the Land of Babylon.

The Babylonian region remained a major center of culture, even after the Babylonian Empire was colonized by other countries. The oldest written record mentioning the existence of the city of Babylon is a clay tablet from the reign of King Sargon the Great (2334\u20132279 BC) around the 23rd century BC. At that time Babylon was only a city of religion and culture, not yet a big city, let alone an independent city-state. The city of Babylon was then subject to the Akkadian Empire, a state that united all Akkadian and Sumerian-speaking peoples under one government. After the fall of the Akkadian Empire, southern Mesopotamia was under the control of the Gutians decades before the founding of the New Sumerian Empire, which ruled over all of Mesopotamia (except for the northern region of Assyria), including the city of Babylon. The history of Mesopotamia has been going on for a long time before Babylon was born. The Sumerian civilization emerged in the area around 3500 BC, while Akkadian-speaking societies emerged in the 30th century BC.[citation needed] In the 3rd millennium BC, an intimate cultural symbiosis developed between Sumerian and Akkadian speakers, which includes the expansion of bilingualism. The influence of the Sumerian language on Akkadian and vice versa is evident in all aspects, from the massive absorption of vocabulary, to the combination of syntax, morphology, and phonology.

Research in the field of nutrition studies the relationship between food and drink on health and disease, especially in determining the optimal diet. In the past, research on nutrition was limited to preventing malnutrition and determining basic nutritional requirements (standards) in living things. This figure for basic nutritional needs is known internationally as the Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA). Along with scientific developments in the medical and molecular biology fields, medical evidence shows that RDA is not sufficient to maintain optimal body function and prevent or help treat chronic diseases. Medical evidence shows that the root of many chronic diseases is oxidative stress caused by an excess of free radicals in the body. The use of nutrients at an optimal level, known as Optimal Daily Allowance (ODA), is proven to be able to prevent and treat oxidative stress thereby helping to prevent chronic diseases. This optimal level can be achieved if the amount and composition of nutrients used are appropriate. In disease management, the use of nutrition as a complementary medicine can help the effectiveness of treatment and at the same time overcome the side effects of treatment. Therefore, nutrition / nutrition is closely related to optimal health and increased quality of life. The results of measuring can be done with the method of anthropometry.

Judaism is considered by Jewish religionists as an expression of the covenant that God made with the Israelites, their ancestors. It includes many texts, practices, theological positions, and forms of organization. The Torah, as it is commonly understood by Jews, is part of a larger text known as the \"Tanakh\". The \"Tanakh\" is also known to secular religious scholars as the Hebrew Bible, and to Christians as the \"Old Testament\". The additional oral tradition of the Torah is represented by later texts such as the Midrash and Talmud.

Today, the largest Jewish religious movements are Orthodox Judaism (Haredi Judaism and Modern Orthodox Judaism), Conservative Judaism, and Reform Judaism. The main source of differences between these groups is their approach to halakha (Jewish law), the authority of rabbinical traditions, and the significance of the State of Israel. Orthodox Judaism maintains that the Torah and halakha are of divine origin, eternal and unchangeable, and that they must be strictly followed. Conservative and Reform Judaism are more liberal, with Conservative Judaism generally promoting a more traditionalist interpretation of Judaism's terms than Reform Judaism. The typical Reformation position was that halakha should be seen as a set of general guidelines rather than as a set of restrictions and obligations that all Jews had to adhere to. Historically, special courts enforced halakha; today, this court still exists but the practice of Judaism is largely voluntary. Authority in theological and legal matters rests not with any one person or organization, but with the sacred and rabbinical texts and the scholars who interpret them.

In addition, almost four times the weight of diamond is made in the lab as synthetic diamond which has a Mohs 11 hardness scale, which can only be made in a laboratory. Diamonds are mainly mined from volcanic pipes, where the diamond content comes from materials expelled from the Earth because the pressure and temperature are suitable for the formation of diamonds. In Indonesia, diamonds have long been mined in the Martapura area, South Kalimantan. Diamonds are found from within the bowels of the earth which are excavated either manually or by mechanization. Now most of the diamond miners have used mechanization, namely with a vacuum machine to suck up the excavated soil. Soil that is sucked up with water, is sorted through a screen. With his skills, the miner can distinguish ordinary stones, sand or diamonds. The newly obtained diamond is called \"galuh\" in the Martapura area. Galuh is still a raw diamond. To make it ready to use, diamonds must first be polished. Most people polish diamonds using traditional tools. This geology-related article is a stub.",

It is bordered by Nigeria to the west, Chad to the northeast, the Central African Republic to the east, and the Republic of the Congo, Gabon and Equatorial Guinea to the south. Cameroon's coast is located on the Bay of Bonny, part of the Gulf of Guinea, and the Atlantic Ocean. The country is called \"Africa in miniature\" because of its diverse geology and culture. The area has beaches, deserts, mountains, rainforests, and savannas. The highest point is Mount Cameroon in the southwest, and the largest cities are Douala, Yaound\u00e9 and Garoua. Cameroon has more than 200 ethnic groups and languages. The country is also known for its distinctive style of music, particularly makossa and bikutsi, and for its national football team. English, and French are official languages. The early inhabitants of this area were the Sao culture around Lake Chad, and the Baka people in the southeast. Portuguese explorers reached its shores in the 15th century, and named the area Rio dos Camar\u00f5es (\"River of Prawns\"), from which the name \"Cameroon\" arose. Fula tribal armies established the Adamawa Emirate in the north in the 19th century, and various ethnic groups in the west, and northwest established chiefdoms, and fondoms. Cameroon became a colony of the German Empire in 1884. After World War I, the territory was divided between France and Britain as a League of Nations mandate. The Union des Populations du Cameroun political party fought for independence but was outlawed in the 1950s. This party fought the French until 1971. In 1960, French Cameroon became independent as the Republic of Cameroon with president Ahmadou Ahidjo. The southern parts of British Cameroon merged in 1961 to form the Federated Republic of Cameroon. The country was later named the Unitary Republic of Cameroon in 1972, and the Republic of Cameroon in 1984.",

The Anglophone community is feeling increasingly alienated from government, and Anglophone politicians are calling for decentralization or even secession. The area now known as Cameroon was first settled in the Neolithic age. The longest-standing residents are Pygmy groups such as the Baka. The Sao culture emerged near Lake Chad around 500 AD, and was replaced by the kingdom of Kanem, and then the kingdom of Bornu. Various kingdoms, fondoms, and chiefdoms also appeared in the west. Seafarers from Portugal reached the coast of Cameroon in 1472. They saw an abundance of prawns, and crabs in the river Wouri, and named it Rio dos Camar\u00f5es (river of prawns), from which the word \"Cameroon\" was derived. After that, European traders and missionaries came to Cameroon and entered the interior. In the early 19th century, Modibo Adama led an army of Fula tribes in a jihad in the north against non-Muslims, and founded the Adamawa Emirate. These people who fled from the Fulani army then settled in various areas. The German Empire colonized Cameroon starting in 1884, and moved inland. They started a project to improve the infrastructure with the slavery system. With the defeat of Germany in World War II, Cameroon became a League of Nations mandate territory, and was divided into the French Cameroun area, and the British Cameroons area in 1919. France then merged Cameroun's economy with the French economy, and improved infrastructure with investment, skilled labour, and slavery. The British ruled their area from neighboring Nigeria.",

One small calorie is about 4.2 joules (so one large calorie is about 4.2 kilojoules). The factor used to convert calories to joules at a given temperature is equivalent to the specific heat capacity of water expressed in joules per kelvin per gram or per kilogram. The exact conversion factor depends on the definition adopted. Despite its unofficial status, the large calorie is still widely used as a unit of food energy. The small calorie is also often used for measurement in chemistry, although the values \u200b\u200binvolved are usually recorded in kilocalories. The calorie was first defined by Nicolas Cl\u00e9ment in 1824 as a unit of heat energy, and entered French and English dictionaries between 1841 and 1867. The term calor comes from the Latin calor meaning \"heat\". The energy required to raise the temperature of water of a given mass by 1\u00b0C depends on the atmospheric pressure and initial temperature. Therefore, there are several different definitions of calories. Pressure is usually taken at standard atmospheric pressure (101.325 kPa).

In this context confusion often arises. The term calorie is very often used for something that should be kilocalories of nutritional energy. Sometimes, in one case to break up the confusion, it's written slightly to Calories (with an uppercase \"K\") simply to try to differentiate, though this is not universal, and not widely understood. To facilitate comparison, specific energy or energy density values \u200b\u200bare often given, for example \"calories per serving\" or \"kilocalories per 100 g\". Nutritional or intake requirements are often expressed in calories per day. In other scientific contexts, the term calorie almost always refers to a small calorie. Although not an SI unit, it is still used in chemistry. For example, the energy released in a chemical reaction per mole of reactant is often expressed in kilocalories per mole. Generally, this use is due more to its convenience for laboratory calculations of reactions, especially in aqueous solutions: the volume of a reactant dissolved in water to form a solution, with a concentration expressed in moles per liter (1 liter equals 1 kg), will cause a change in temperature in degrees Celsius for the total solvent volume of water, and this quantity (volume, molar concentration, and temperature change) can then be used to calculate the energy per mole. It is also sometimes used to express energy quantities related to reaction energies, such as the enthalpy of formation and the size of activation barrier. However, its use has been superseded by the SI unit, the joule, and some of its multiples such as the kilojoule. In the past, bomb calorimeters were used to determine the energy content of food by burning a sample and measuring the change in temperature in the surrounding water. Currently, this method is not commonly used in the United States and has been replaced by calculating the energy content indirectly from the sum of the energy provided by energy-containing food nutrients (such as protein, carbohydrates, and fats), the Modified Atwater system.",

Derived from the theory of romanticism, namely \"cultural identity\", liberalism debate which considers political correctness is sourced from the will of the people, or a combination of both theories. Ties of nationalism grow in society when the mindset begins to decline. This bond occurs when humans begin to live together in a certain area and do not move from there.

Romantic nationalism (also called organic nationalism, identity nationalism) is a continuation of ethnic nationalism in which the state derives political correctness by nature (\"organic\") the result of nation or race; in the spirit of romanticism. Romantic nationalism is dependent on the embodiment of ethnic culture that adheres to romantic ideals; the story of tradition that has been designed for the concept of romantic nationalism. For example, Herder's \"Brothers Grimm\" is a collection of stories related to ethnic Germans. Cultural Nationalism is a type of nationalism in which the state derives political correctness from shared culture rather than \"hereditary traits\" such as skin color, race and so on. The best example is the Chinese people who think that the state is based on culture. The racial element has been reversed where the Manchus and other minority races are still considered as Chinese citizens. The willingness of the Qing dynasty to adopt Chinese customs testifies to the integrity of Chinese culture.

Urine is filtered in the kidneys, carried through the ureters to the bladder, and finally excreted out of the body through the urethra. Urine consists of water with dissolved materials in the form of metabolic waste (such as urea), dissolved salts, and organic matter. The fluids and materials that make up urine come from the blood or interstitial fluid. The composition of the urine changes during the reabsorption process when molecules important to the body, eg glucose, are reabsorbed into the body via carrier molecules. The remaining fluid contains high levels of urea and various excess or potentially toxic compounds that will be excreted from the body.

He became a student of Plato while in Athens. Aristotle studied from Plato for 20 years. During his life, he wrote about philosophy and other sciences, namely physics, politics, ethics, biology and psychology. Aristotle divided philosophy into four issues, namely logic, physics, metaphysics and practical knowledge. Analysis of philosophy is done using a syllogism. Aristotle's thoughts regarding logic which utilize the deductive method are used as the basis for formal logic. Aristotle also believed that the existence of science was intended to support human life. Aristotle was born in a small town called Stagira in 384 BC. The city is part of the Kalkidiki peninsula. Aristotle's upbringing was carried out by his family in Atarneus, Anatolia. This condition was caused by his father dying at a young age during a trial in Pella, Central Macedonia. His father's occupation was as a physicist. At first, Aristotle was a student of Plato. But he later rejected some of Plato's thoughts and started his own philosophical thought. Aristotle founded an educational and research center called the Lyceum. Through this place, he conveyed his thoughts which then influenced the thinking of other philosophers, theologians or scientists. Aristotle lived in an environment that supported cultural and intellectual creativity. During his lifetime, the city-states of Greece were divided by the defeat of Athens by Sparta in the Peloponnesian War in 404 BC. The long-running conflict between the Greek city-states ended when Philip II of Macedon conquered these countries and founded the Macedonian Empire.

Aristotle considered that human thought transcends the three types of abstractions that make up philosophy, namely physics, mathematics and metaphysics. Man transcends physics when he begins to think while making observations. During thinking, the human mind escapes from observations that use the senses to feel everything that can be felt by its existence. General knowledge is then known from particular and real things. Physics knowledge is then formed through abstract knowledge and human reason. Furthermore, the abstraction of mathematics enables humans to understand invisible matter. Reason detaches itself from everything that can be understood. All the material characteristics of this abstraction then produce science. Meanwhile, the abstraction of metaphysics appears after humans do abstraction of physics. In the third abstraction, humans have been able to think about the reality of all matter along with its origins and purposes for its formation. Aristotle considers this abstraction to be the first philosophy. Aristotle used the term \"first philosophy\" instead of metaphysics because according to him all philosophy was derived from this abstraction. The first philosophy in Aristotle's view can be interpreted into two senses. The first is as science which is the first principle. While the second is a science that discusses existence as an existence along with the characteristics of objects. Aristotle argued that the method of discovering new knowledge and truth is divided into two. First, the inductive method and the second is the deductive method. The inductive method aims to conclude specific things into a general conclusion. Meanwhile, the deductive method only concludes the truth of two things that are certain and undoubted.

The only stable isotope is 23Na. The free metal does not occur in nature, but must be prepared from its compounds. Sodium is the sixth most abundant element in the Earth's crust, and occurs in many minerals such as feldspar, sodalite and halite (rock salt, NaCl). Many sodium salts are highly soluble in water: sodium ions have been leached by the action of water from Earth's minerals over thousands of years, and thus sodium and chlorine are the most common dissolved elements occurring in the oceans (by weight). Sodium was first isolated by Humphry Davy in 1807 by electrolysis of sodium hydroxide. Among many other useful sodium compounds, sodium hydroxide (lye) is used in soap making, and sodium chloride (table salt) is a deicing agent and nutrient for animals including humans. Sodium is an essential element for all animals and some plants. Sodium ions are the main cation in the extracellular fluid (ECF) and therefore a major contributor to ECF osmotic pressure and ECF compartment volume. Loss of water from the ECF compartment increases sodium concentration, a condition called hypernatremia. Isotonic loss of water and sodium from the ECF compartment reduces the size of that compartment in a condition called ECF hypovolemia. By means of a sodium-potassium pump, a living human cell pumps three sodium ions out of the cell instead of the two potassium ions it pumps in; comparing the concentrations of ions across the cell membrane, from inside to outside, potassium is about 40:1, and sodium, about 1:10.",

Sodium metal can be easily cut with a knife and is a good conductor of electricity and heat, having only one electron in its valence shell, resulting in weak metallic bonds and free electrons, which carry energy. Due to its low atomic mass and long atomic radius, sodium is the 3rd lowest density metallic element of all metals and one of only three metals that can float in water, the other two being lithium and potassium. The melting (98\u00b0C) and boiling (883\u00b0C) points of sodium are lower than those of lithium but higher than those of the heavier alkali metals (potassium, rubidium and cesium), following periodic trends down the group from top to bottom. This property changes dramatically with increasing pressure: at 1.5 Mbar, the color changes from silvery to black; at 1.9\u00a0Mbar it becomes transparent with a red tint; and at 3 Mbar, sodium is a clear, transparent solid. All of these high pressure allotropes are insulators and electrids.

This religion is also known as Karuhun Urang Way (tradition of ancestors), Sundanese Wiwitan religion, Madrais teachings or Cigugur religion. The Javanese-Sundanese religion (ADS), which was established around 1925 in Cigugur, is one of the local religions as well as a growing indigenous community in West Java. This is because ADS, besides believing in and defending the teachings of its predecessor, Kyai Madrais, also tries to preserve the traditional heritage of their ancestors. As a local religious minority group, ADS often experience obstacles and threats in the form of state bans and discriminatory actions from the majority official religion group which makes this community increasingly marginalized and pressured politically and culturally. In religious life, Kelurahan Cigugur is an area whose inhabitants embrace various religions. This is evidenced from population data which shows the number of religious adherents in the Cigugur Village consists of various religions, namely 4,075 Muslims, 2,620 Catholics, 195 Protestants, 176 believers, 12 Buddhists, and 6 Hindus. Residents in Cigugur are diverse, plural in nature, even within a family there is a diversity of religions, the religions of parents and children are different. The diversity of religions embraced by residents in Cigugur does not cause relations between adherents of different religions to be tenuous and rigid. The attitude of tolerance and mutual respect between them actually looks harmonious. Harmonious relations, evidenced by the existence of cooperation and mutual cooperation between religious communities in the construction of various houses of worship in Cigugur.

Madrais is the son of Prince Alibasa (the ninth Prince of Gebang) from his marriage to R. Kastewi, the fifth descendant of Tumenggung Jayadipura Susukan. When he was born his name was Prince Sadewa Alibasa who in the family tree is called Prince Surya Nata or Prince Kusuma Adiningrat. Madrais was born in Susukan Ciawi Gebang in 1822. Then in 1825 he was entrusted to Ki Sastra Wedana, a Kuwu in Cigugur with the hope that one day he would be able to continue the struggle of his ancestors against the invaders. To trick the Kompeni, it was willed that the child be recognized as the child of Ki Sastra Wadana. It was later discovered that he was not the son of Ki Sastra Wadana, but the son of R. Kastewi from Susukan Ciawigebang, whose father was not explained. At the age of 10, Prince Kusuma Adiningrat worked for Kuwu Sagarahiang as a buffalo herder known as Taswan. When he was leaving Sagarahiang, he advised his friends that his real name was Madrais (short for Mohamad Rais), son of Ki Sastra Wadana from Cigugur. Around 1840 Prince Kusuma Adinigrat returned to Cigugur and from time to time he traveled around West Java. Until finally he returned to Cigugur and founded peguron / pesantren and taught Islam. He is popularly called by the name of Kyai Madrais. The name Kyai Madrais is also well known in the Heubel Isuk and Ciwedus Islamic Boarding Schools (Gebang area) as an intelligent and influential person. Apart from teaching Islam, he also conveyed the teachings of religions in order to find common points in Belief in the One and Only God.",

Subsequent work was done by Glynn Isaac. North Africans moved to Kenya around 2000 BC. Arab traders began visiting the Kenyan coast in the early first century. As Kenya's proximity to the Arabian Peninsula invited colonization, Arab and Persian settlements developed along the coast in the 8th century. In the early millennium, Nilotic and Bantu peoples began to move into the area, and still make up three-quarters of Kenya's population. Several centuries before the colonization of white people/Europeans, Kenya was part of the eastern part of the African continent which was routinely used by Arabs to find slaves who could be sold in markets. Initially these slave seekers came from Arabia, but later they also came from Zanzibar (like Tippu Tip). The Ameru people descended from slaves who had fled from Arab lands around 1700.

Summarizing one of the islands of the Lesser Antilles, Barbados is located in the eastern part of the group. Barbados is known for its tourism industry and is known as the Little England or 'Little England' of the Caribbean. This is due to the strong British influence on this island. The island of Barbados is located 2,585 km southeast of Miami, United States of America and 860 km from Caracas, Venezuela. The original inhabitants of this island are the Arawak tribe. The tribe was later driven out by the Caribbean Indians in the early 14th century. In the early 15th century Spanish conquistadors arrived in Barbados and had taken the Caribbean tribes as slaves. As a result, the rest of these clans have moved to adjacent islands. Portuguese explorer Pedro a Campos had stopped on this island in 1536 during his journey to Brazil. He had named this island Los Barbados ('those who bear the beard'), probably after seeing the island's 'fig' tree, which had long hanging roots hanging down like a beard. Barbados was uninhabited when the English came to settle in 1627. Captain John Powell landed on Barbados in 1625 and declared this deserted island a British colony. Two years later, his brother Captain Henry Powell landed with 80 sailors and 10 slaves. The group had founded the first European settlement at Jamestown, on the West coast and now known as Holetown. By the end of 1628 the population of the colony had grown to 2,000 people. After a few years, colonists have cleared a lot of wilderness and planted tobacco and cotton. In the 1640s they replanted these fields with sugarcane. Their fields were the largest sugarcane fields in the Caribbean, and the production of sugar brought in a very good profit for the growers and smokers of Barbados.",

But the economy of Barbados still depends on sugar, \"rum\" and \"molasses\" until the 20th century. In 1639, the settlers on this island formed a Legislative Assembly, which was the second parliament established in the British colony after Bermuda. All this time the people of Barbados were loyal to the King and after King Charles I was beheaded in 1649, Oliver Cromwell, the Prime Minister of Great Britain sent his army to Barbados to get their recognition. His army arrived in 1651 and a year later the 'Articles of Capitulation' were signed, which were the basis of the \"Charter of Barbados\". This charter guarantees the government of Barbados headed by a governor, independent representation, and freedom from taxation without local authority. When the King system was restored in 1660, this Charter gave more freedom to the people here. Racial discrimination is rampant on this island. Although the slavery system was abolished in 1834, there were still many slaves who were more comfortable living on the plantations. Blacks who refused to be slaves, were forced to live in wild settlements. When the economy fell (known as (The Great Depression) in the 1930s, unemployment increased, and living conditions became more and more acute until chaos broke out in these islands. To overcome political instability, the British had to give in to the black reformers and involve they into the country's political process.

He was the first philosopher of the Pythagorean School to issue a written work. His name is mentioned in collections of medical theory as early as the 5th century BC. In addition, there is information about him from a papyrus found in the British Museum. There are only a few fragments of his writings that are still preserved today. One of his famous works is \"About Nature\" (On Nature). Philolaos was from Croton. He was born around 470 BC. After the Pythagorean school in Kroton was destroyed and its members scattered, he left and settled in Thebes. Then he left again and settled in Targentum. The two students of Socrates who accompanied him in his last moments were also known as students of Philolaos. Philolaos states that there are two principles in all that exists. These two principles he called \"the finite\" and \"the infinite.\" Although different, the two are united by \"order\". Thus, everything comes from different elements that are united by this \"order\". In addition, everything that exists can also be identified by numbers. The reason is that if everything that exists is finite, then it can be separated from one another. If something can be separated, it means that something can always be counted. Therefore, everything \"limited\" that humans know will always be able to be calculated. Regarding the universe, Philolaos argues that the first thing that came into \"order\" was the so-called \"fire furnace\". This \"furnace\" is located at the center of the universe. Thus, the universe is seen as a unit. Existence begins at the center, the \"furnace,\" and expands in all directions.",

In essence, speech includes the art of monologue in speaking skills. Speech is two-way, that is, the speaker must pay attention to the other person even though the speaker dominates the conversation. The interlocutor must listen to the messages conveyed by the speaker in the form of words (verbal) or not words (non-verbal) so that what is conveyed can be received and understood perfectly. Speeches are usually delivered by leaders or people who are considered important to provide direction or advice to their listeners, because the function of speeches is to provide information, advice, motivation, warnings, and knowledge. In order for the speech to be delivered to be well received by the audience, the utterances or sentences must be properly and neatly arranged according to the rules of the language in force. Sentences that are arranged sequentially and systematically so that they are pleasant to listen to and can give a positive impression to those who listen. Broadly speaking, the structure of a speech consists of: This method is a method in which the person delivering the speech reads the speech text that has been prepared beforehand. The manuscript is compiled, then read in full from the beginning to the end of the speech. This speech method is commonly used in delivering formal and official speeches, such as state speeches, government remarks, or reports from official institutions. This method does not need to carry a script or other text because the speaker memorizes the entire contents of the speech. Speech texts are also prepared beforehand, but they are not brought before the public. Speeches with this method are commonly used among students or novice public orators. Among students, the speech memorizing method is intended for the learning process.",

The advantage is that it is fluent if you really memorize it, there's nothing wrong if you really memorize it, and the speaker's eyes can see the listener. The weakness is that the speaker tends to speak quickly without understanding, cannot adjust to the situation and listener's reaction, and if he forgets his speech fails miserably. Impromptu is a method of delivering a speech without preparing a script, small notes, or memorizing it beforehand. The delivery is impromptu. The speaker directly spoke according to what he knew and crossed his mind. This method can only be conveyed by people who have high flying hours as orators. He is accustomed and professional in conveying his thoughts in public. The advantage is that the presentation of speech material feels fresher and more interesting. The weakness is that the speech is not smooth and chaotic for novice speakers and the possibility of failing to convey the contents of the speech properly is quite large. Outlining the Outline The speaker prepares the main points of the speech and then arranges them in the form of a speech outline. In addition, the speaker also makes special notes needed in the speech. In speeches the framework is developed directly and the notes are reviewed when needed. Giving a speech by outlining this framework is highly recommended because of its flexibility. The speaker is guided by the outline of the speech he has created. Thus, the contents of the speech can be delivered coherently and nothing is forgotten. Meanwhile, the speaker is free to look at the listener to build inner contact. The speaker is also free to adjust his speech according to the situation and listener's reaction. If the outline and notes can be memorized, the speaker can appear without carrying a piece of paper. This is of course even better because the speaker can concentrate more on improving the quality of his speech to make it more interesting. The advantages of this speech method are that the main contents of the speech are not forgotten, the delivery of the contents of the speech is coherent, the possibility of mistakes is small, and it is communicative.",

        "paragraph": "Bipolar junction transistor or bipolar junction transistor (English: Bipolar junction transistor or abbreviated BJT or Bipolar transistor) is a type of transistor. It is a three-channel device made of doped semiconductor material. Dipole is so named because its operation includes both electrons and electron holes, as opposed to polar transistors such as FETs which use only one of the carriers. Although a small proportion of the transistor current are majority carriers, nearly all of the transistor current is due to the minority carriers, so a BJT is classified as a minority-carrier device. The NPN transistor can be thought of as two diodes backed by a single anode. In normal use, the emitter-base p-n junction is forward biased and the base-collector junction is reverse biased. In an NPN transistor, for example, if a positive voltage is applied across the base-emitter junction, the balance between the heat-generated carriers and the repelling electric field in the depletion region becomes unbalanced, allowing heat-disturbed electrons to enter the base region. These electrons wander (or scatter) through the base from an area of \u200b\u200bhigh concentration near the emitter to a low concentration near the collector. The electrons in the base are called minority carriers because the base is doped to be p-type which makes the holes the majority carriers in the base. The base area of \u200b\u200bthe transistor must be made thin, so that the carriers can propagate through it more quickly than the minority carriers age in the semiconductor to reduce the number of carriers combining. back before reaching the collector-base junction. To ensure this, the thickness of the base is made much lower than the scattering length of the electrons. The collector-base junction is reverse biased, so very little injection of electrons occurs from the collector to the base, but electrons spreading through the base towards the collector are swept towards the collector by the field at the collector-base junction. The collector-emitter current can be viewed as being controlled by the base-emitter current (current control) or the base-emitter voltage (voltage control).",

        "paragraph": "This view deals with the current-voltage relationship of the base-emitter junction, which is simply the usual exponential current-voltage curve of a p-n junction diode. The physical explanation for the collector current is the sum of the minority charge carriers in the base region. A detailed model of transistor behavior, the Gummel\u2013Poon model, calculates the distribution of these charges explicitly to describe transistor behavior more precisely. This view of charge-control simply handles the phototransistor, where the minority carriers in the base region are generated by absorption of photons, and handles dynamic shutdown or recovery time, which depend on charge recombination in the base region. However, because base charge is not a signal that can be measured in the line, current and voltage control views are commonly used in circuit design and analysis. In analog circuit design, current control views are often used because they are nearly linear. The collector current is approximately \u03b2F{\\displaystyle \\beta _{F}} times the base current. Some basic circuits can be designed by assuming that the base-emitter voltage is approximately constant, and that the collector current is beta times the base current. However, to accurately and reliably design BJT circuits, a voltage-control model (eg the Ebers\u2013Moll model) is required. The voltage-controlled model requires the exponential function to be considered, but if this is linearized, the transistor can be modeled as a transconductance, as in the Ebers\u2013Moll model, the design for circuits such as the differential amplifier becomes a linear problem, so the voltage-control view is often preferred. For translinear circuits, where the exponential I\u2013V curve is the key to operation, the transistor is usually modeled as voltage controlled with a transconductance proportional to the collector current. A dipole transistor experiences some characteristic delay when it is turned on and off. Almost all transistors, especially power transistors, suffer from a long base shelf life which limits the operating frequency and switching speed.",

The main character of this school is Manichaeus, he was born in the village of Mardinu, in the Nahr desert of Kuta, South Babylon on April 14, 216. Iran's greatest gnostic, originated in Sassanid Persia. Although many of the original manuscripts of the founding prophet, Mani (Syriac, \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd, c. AD 210\u2013276) have been lost, a number of translations and text fragments have survived. Manicism arose between the 3rd and 7th centuries, and at its heyday was one of the most widespread religions in the world. The churches and scriptures of Mani existed as far east as China and as far west as the Roman Empire. Manicism simply disappeared before the 16th century in southern China. The original six holy books of Manicism, in Syriac Aramaic, were translated into other languages \u200b\u200bto help spread the religion. As it spread eastward, Mani's writings were published in Middle Persian, Parthian, Sogdian, and Uyghur and Chinese. As they spread westward, they were translated into Greek, Coptic, and Latin. The spread and success of Manicism was seen as a threat to other religions, and continued to be suppressed in Christian, Zoroastrian, Buddhist, and Islamic areas.",

Bayer is one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world. Headquartered in Leverkusen, Bayer's business areas include human and veterinary pharmaceuticals; retail health care products; agricultural chemicals, seeds, and biotechnology products. The company's shares are a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index. Werner Baumann has been Bayer's CEO since 2016. Founded in Barmen in 1863 as a dyes manufacturer, Bayer's first and most famous product was aspirin. In 1898, Bayer registered the name heroin as a trademark for its drug diacetylmorphine, then marketed it as a cough suppressant and non-addictive substitute for morphine until 1910. Bayer also introduced phenobarbital; prontosil, the first widely used antibiotic that won the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1939; Cipro antibiotics (ciprofloxacin); and the Yaz birth control pill (drospirenone). In 1925, Bayer was one of six chemical companies that combined to form IG Farben, the world's largest pharmaceutical and medical device company. The Allied Control Council confiscated IG Farben after World War II,a] because of his role in the Nazi war effort and involvement in the Holocaust, which included the use of forced labor from concentration camps and the purchase of humans for purposes of hazardous medical testing. In 1951, IG Farben was returned to its original form, which was split into six companies, and then split again into three companies, namely BASF, Bayer and Hoechst. Bayer played a key role in the Wirtschaftswunder in post-war West Germany, allowing it to quickly return to being the largest pharmaceutical and chemical company in the world.",

Bayer AG was founded as a dyes manufacturer in 1863 in Barmen (later part of Wuppertal), Germany, by Friedrich Bayer and his partner, Johann Friedrich Weskott, a colorist. Friedrich Bayer is in charge of commercial activities. Fuhsin and aniline were initially the company's most important products. [citation needed] The headquarters and most of Bayer's factories were then moved from Barmen to the larger grounds of Elberfeld in 1866. Friedrich Bayer (1851\u20131920), son of Bayer's founder, was a chemist and joined the company in 1873. After Friedrich Bayer died in 1880, the company was registered as a legal entity under the name Farbenfabriken vorm. Friedr.

A new city called Leverkusen was founded there in 1930 and is the location of Bayer AG's head office to this day. The company logo, the Bayer cross, was introduced in 1904, and features the two words BAYER written vertically and horizontally, sharing a Y and surrounded by a circle. The bright version of the logo has become one of the icons at Leverkusen.

        "paragraph": "In general, poisons are solid, liquid, or gaseous substances, which can interfere with the life processes of an organism's cells. Toxic substances can enter the body through oral (mouth) and topical (body surface) routes. In relation to biology, a poison is a substance that causes injury, illness, and death to an organism, usually by chemical reaction or other activity on a molecular scale. The father of Toxicology, Paracelsus, stated that: Everything is poison and nothing is without poison. Only the dose that makes something non-toxic (Dose sola facit venenum). The term poison is synonymous with the word toxin and can, but has a different definition from one to another. The word \"toxin\" is defined as a toxin produced from a biological process, or often referred to as a biotoxin. Meanwhile, it can be defined as a liquid containing poison secreted or produced by animals during the process of self-defense or attacking other animals with bites or stings. The terms toxic, toxic, and venomous are also comparable words when used to describe the nature or effects of a poison. However, there are still slight differences in the three words. Toxic is used for anything that can be fatal or dangerous when put in a certain amount to living things. Meanwhile, toxic states the nature or effect of the toxin, and venomous refers to venom-producing animals. In a medical forensic book written by JL Casper, poisons are classified into 5 groups, namely: 1. Irritant poisons, namely poisons that cause irritation and inflammation. Examples are mineral acids, toxic fungi, and arsenic preparations. 2. The poison that causes hyperemia, is a narcotic poison, which has been shown to be fatal to the brain, lungs and heart. For example opium, tobacco, konium, dogitalis, etc.",

        "paragraph": "3. Toxins that paralyze the nerves, by poisoning the blood, the central nervous organs can be paralyzed and cause fatal consequences such as sudden death. Examples are hydrocyanic acid, zinc cyanide, and chloroform. 4. The poison that causes marasmus is usually chronic and can be fatal to health slowly. Examples include white bismuth, lead smoke, mercury and arsenic. 5. Poisons that cause infections (septic poisons), can be food poisons which in certain circumstances cause Pyaemia (or pyemia) and typhoid fever in livestock. The early history of poison is closely associated with myths and beliefs. In 2500 BC, the Sumerians are known to have worshiped a poison goddess called Gula. In Greek mythology, there are several references to poison, among them the story of Medea, the granddaughter of Helios (the sun god). Medea wanted to kill her stepson Theseus with poisoned wine. However, this attempt was thwarted by Aegeus, Medea's husband. The oldest writings on poisons were found in Egypt and dated to around 3000 BC and documents on research into poisonous plants by Menes, king of Egypt. In Greek history, poison was used as a death sentence which was called State Poison. One of the philosophers who was executed in this way was Socrates. During the reign of the Roman empire, poisoning at dinner, especially among the upper class, became commonplace. This was one way to get rid of family members you didn't like, as Nero had done. Around 246 BC, China developed a drama called the Chou Ritual, in which there was a ritual of burning 5 kinds of poison. Entering the Middle Ages, in 8 AD, poisons developed because Arab chemists managed to turn arsenic into a tasteless and odorless powder so that the detection of poison was difficult to detect.",
