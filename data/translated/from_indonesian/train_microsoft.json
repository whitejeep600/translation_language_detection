He writes, \"The more famous rabbis often gathered around them a large number of young men who desired to be taught, with the aim of making them intimately acquainted with the 'oral law' which was so variegated and numerous in number. . . . The teaching consists of tirelessly continuous training of memory. . . . The teacher asks some questions about the law to his students whose decisions they must take and let them give answers or he answers them himself. Students are also allowed to ask questions of the teacher\". From the rabbins' point of view, what the disciples were at stake was far more important than simply receiving a pass. Those who study under the guidance of such teachers are given the warning, \"Whoever forgets one thing from what he has learned\u2014according to the Scriptures, it is a matter of life or death\". (Avot 3:8) The greatest praise is bestowed upon the student who is like \"a well plastered, which does not lose a drop of water\". (Avot 2:8) It was this type of training that Paul, who at that time was known by his Hebrew name, Saul, from Gamaliel, received. In line with the Pharisees' teaching, Gamaliel advocated a belief in oral law. Thus he placed greater emphasis on the rabbinical tradition than on the inspired Scriptures.

The relationship can also occur with a person's age, years of events or the like. The Hebrew term is most likely derived from the Greek word ge\u014dmetri\u0101, \"geometry\", which is used as a translation of the word g\u0113ma\u1e6driy\u0101. There are experts who argue the word of origin is from another Greek term, grammateia; both may have had an influence on the formation of the Hebrew word. (There are also those who think the word is derived from the Greek alphabetical order, gamma as the third letter (tri) of the Greek alphabet: gamma + tria.) The word has also been used in English since the 17th century from translation work by Giovanni Pico della Mirandola.

The most common values for vowels are as follows (in brackets is a calculation based on the number of numbers, which is less common): Sometimes the names of living letters are spelled in full and gematria is calculated from the spelling, using standard media. The oldest record of the use of gematria is found in an Assyrian inscription made by king Sargon II (727\u2013705 BC) which states that the king built the Khorsabad city wall along 16,283 cubits (pinches) according to the letter value of his name.

The purpose of worship is conveyed by Allah in Surah Al-Baqarah verse 21, which is as a form of achieving piety. The concept of worship in Islam is in accordance with the concept of the purpose of God's creation of man, which is to serve Him. The benefit of worship for man is to obtain God's blessings and increase the motivation and spirit of life in the world. Worship is divided into two types, namely general worship and special worship. Public worship includes all good deeds intended to obtain God's blessings. Meanwhile, special worship is worship whose procedures for implementation have been ordained by God. Worship has two main elements. First, the element of submission to God. Second, the element of love for God. These two elements must be possessed in order for an act to be of worship value. Worship in Islam is based on the Qur'an and sunnah. Every global matter of worship in the Qur'an gets a more detailed explanation in the sunnah. This form of sunnah is every utterance, deed and approval of the Prophet Muhammad. Some Islamic worship is fixed and some are developing according to the needs of the times. This developmental worship remains based on the Qur'an and sunnah coupled with the ijtihad of the scholars. The purpose of holding worship is to achieve piety. This purpose is mentioned in Surah Al-Baqarah verse 21. In this verse, God speaks by calling upon man to worship Him. This worship is a form of recognition of God as the creator who created man and previous generations of humans.

Communitarianism is not in itself a disgrace to liberalism in the sense it says in America today, but its emphasis is different. It shifts the center of attention to communities and communities and away from individuals. Priority issues, whether on individuals or communities, often have the most pronounced impact on the most pressing ethical issues, such as health care, abortion, multiculturalism, and incitement. Although the term communitarianism dates back to the 20th century, it comes from the term communitarian of the 1840s, coined by Goodwyn Barmby to refer to people who are members or advocates of a communist society. The use of this term in modern times redefines its original meaning. Many communitarian advocates traced their philosophy to earlier thinkers. The term itself is basically used in three senses: 1) Philosophical communitarianism considers classical liberalism ontologically and epistemologically incoherent, and opposes it on the basis of such reasons. In contrast to classical liberalism, which understood that communionism originated from the voluntary actions of individuals from pre-community times, communitarianism emphasized the role of communities in defining and shaping individuals. Communitarians believe that the value of community is not sufficiently recognized in liberal theories of justice. 2) Ideological communitarianism is a radical middle ideology, which emphasizes community, and is sometimes characterized by its leftist understanding of economic issues and conservatism in social issues. The use of this term was coined recently. If the term is capitalized, it usually refers to the Responsive Communitarian movement of Amitai Etzioni and other philosophers.

Communitarian philosophers are primarily concerned with ontological and epistemological issues, so it is different from policy issues. The communitarian response to John Rawls' book, A Theory of Justice reflects dissatisfaction with the image Rawls presents of the human being as an atomistic individual. Although Rawls allows space for compassion (benevolence), for example, he views it solely as one of the many values that exist within one's head. Communitarians claim values and beliefs that exist in the public sphere, where debates take place. they say that being an individual means taking a stand on issues that circulate in the public domain. For example, in the United States of America the debate on gun politics, there are a number of stances to be taken, but all of these attitudes first presuppose the existence of a firearms politics debate; This is a sense in which community existed before individualism. Similarly, both linguistic and non-linguistic traditions are communicated to children and become the background for the formulation and understanding of individual beliefs. An individual's dependence on community members is usually intended to be descriptive. This does not mean that the individual must accept the beliefs of the majority, such as for example the historical belief that slavery is acceptable, he must do so for reasons that are reasonable within the community in question (e.g., Christian religious reasons, reasons derived from the Enlightenment's conception of human rights) and not merely any old reason. In this sense, the rejection of a majority belief relies on the deep traditions of other majority beliefs. However, the opposite sense, a breakthrough sense that, as for example is the case of Kepler or Galileo astronomy, was developed by an individual in the opposite direction to the 'traditional majority beliefs', which until then had never been discussed in communitarian literature.

The term termite actually refers to the animal in general, even though there are several different forms known, as in the colony of ants or social bees. In colonies, termites have no wings. However, some termites can reach a winged form that will come out of their nests in droves at the beginning of the rainy season (so it is often a harbinger of a change to the rainy season) in the evening and fly close to the light. This form is known as laron or stickiness. Termites are a type of insect that is easy to find. In addition, termites are also often considered as pests that damage objects in houses that are usually made of wood. Therefore, termites are often disliked by some people. Termites really like dark and humid places but still have warm temperatures, so it's no wonder that termites often live in wood or close to the ground level. Termites live in dark places because termites cannot stand the light. Just like bees, it turns out that the lives of termites that colonize have their own position in a group. In the socialization system, there are termite kings and queens who have the task of breeding or in other words they are tasked with hatching other termite candidates.

There are several parts of the nest including termite habitation, water storage through condensation, reproductive space or for breeding and sometimes there is also a food storage room. The rooms in the nest are connected to the creation of mazes or tunnels that can provide air to the nest and allow termites to move more freely in the nest. Therefore, usually termite nests are often piled up and raised even to the point of appearing on the surface of the ground, and some even end up forming large mounds. Termites will work together to collect food every day, of course, this is done by worker termites. The food that has been obtained will usually be collected into a cavity or special room for storing food. These foods will later be consumed by all members of termites.

Individuals who consider themselves to be elites form an organization that will help them attract more working class and financially stable individuals, with the main objective of fighting their enemies and schools of thought.

In the first quarter of the 20th century, Lenin, a Russian philosopher argued that the vanguard party would spearhead a revolution in order to overthrow the Tsarist government, and thereafter transferred the legislative power of the government to members of the working class of the party.

In biochemistry, hydroxylation reactions are often facilitated by an enzyme called hydroxylase. Hydroxylation is the first step in the oxidative degradation of organic compounds in the air. This process is very important in detoxification because hydroxylation converts lipophilic compounds into water-soluble (hydrophilic) products that are more easily eliminated by the kidneys or liver and excreted. Some pharmaceutical drugs (for example, steroids are activated or deactivated by hydroxylation. The hydroxylation process involves the conversion of a CH group into a COH group. Hydroxylation is an oxidative process. Oxygen introduced into the C-H bond usually comes from atmospheric oxygen (O2). Since O2 itself is a slow hydroxycillator, a catalyst is needed to accelerate the process rate. The main hydroxycillator agent in nature is cytochrome P-450, there are hundreds of known variations. Other hydroxylators include flavin. The most commonly encountered hydroxylation residue in human proteins is proline. This happens because in reality collagen makes up about 25-35% of proteins in the human body, and contains hydroxyproline on almost every 3rd residue in its amino acid sequence. Hydroxylation occurs on the \u03b3-C atom, forming hydroxyproline (Hyp), which stabilizes the secondary structure of collagen due to the strong electronegative effects of oxygen atoms. Proline hydroxylation is also a vital component of the hypoxic response through hypoxic induction factors. In some cases, proline can be hydroxylated at the position of the \u03b2-C atom. Lysine can also be hydroxylated on the \u03b4-C atom, forming hydroxylicin (Hyl). These three reactions are catalyzed by highly occurring multi-subunit enzymes prolyl 4-hydroxylase, prolyl 3-hydroxylation and lysyl 5-hydroxylase. These reactions require iron (in addition to molecular oxygen and \u03b1-ketoglutarate) for the continuity of oxidation, and use ascorbic acid (vitamin C) to return iron to its oxidized state.

Herbert Warington Smyth reported on the description of hawkers from the Malay peninsula in the late 19th century. The boat used \"dipping lugsail\", with a deck house or small tent (called kajang in Malay) and there was a prominent gallery at the stern (called dandan). :573 The peddler is made from lightweight materials. It is usually very long and narrow and has a shallow depth (draft). This allowed them to sail on corals and rivers. A large peddler needs an outrigger, because without it, it can drown. For combat purposes, the cruiser was equipped with both large-caliber cannons and lelas (smaller cannons than Western cannons). In small peddlers there are only one or two lantaka.

HTTP is the basis of data communication for the World Wide Web, where hypertext documents include hyperlinks to other resources that users can easily access, for example by clicking the mouse or by tapping the screen in a web browser. HTTP development was initiated by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in 1989. The development of the initial HTTP Request for Comments (RFC) was a coordinated effort by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), with work later moving to the IETF. HTTP/1.1 was first documented in RFC 2068 in 1997. That specification was deprecated by RFC 2616 in 1999, which was also replaced by the RFC 7230 RFC family in 2014. HTTP/2 is a more efficient expression of HTTP semantics \"on the wire\", and was published in 2015; is now supported by almost all major web browsers and web servers via Transport Layer Security (TLS) using the Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) extension where TLS 1.2 or later is required. HTTP/3 is the proposed successor to HTTP/2, which is already used on the web, using UDP instead of TCP for the underlying transport protocol.

Support for HTTP/3 was added to Cloudflare and Google Chrome in September 2019, and can be enabled in stable versions of Chrome and Firefox. ", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "HTTP serves as a request-response protocol in the client-server computing model. A web browser, for example, might be a client and an application running on the computer hosting a website might be a server. The client sends an HTTP request message to the server. The server, which provides resources such as HTML files and other content, or performs other functions on behalf of the client, returns a response message to the client. The response contains completion status information about the request and may also contain the requested content in its message body. A web browser is an example of a user agent (UA). Other types of user agents include indexing software used by search providers (web crawlers), voice browsers, mobile applications, and other software that accesses, uses, or displays web content. HTTP is designed to allow intermediate network elements to enhance or enable communication between the client and the server. High-traffic websites often benefit from web cache servers that deliver content on behalf of upstream servers to improve response times. The web browser cache previously accessed web resources and reused them, where possible, to reduce network traffic. An HTTP proxy server at the boundary of a private network can facilitate communication for clients without a globally routable address, by relaying messages with an external server. HTTP resources are identified and placed on the network by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), using the http and https Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) schemes. As defined in RFC 3986, URIs are encoded as hyperlinks in HTML documents, so they can form interrelated hypertext documents. The term hypertext was coined by Ted Nelson in 1965 at Project Xanadu, which in turn was inspired by Vannevar Bush's 1930s vision of microfilm-based information retrieval and management \"memex\" systems described in his 1945 essay \"As We May Think\".

Although it is present in both the male and female bodies, its content is much higher in the body of women of childbearing age. This hormone causes the development and preservation of secondary sex signs in women, such as breasts, and is also involved in the thickening of the endometrium as well as in the regulation of the menstrual cycle. During menopause, estrogen begins to decrease so that it can cause several effects, including hot flashes, sweating at bedtime, and excessive anxiety. The three main types of estrogen found naturally in a woman's body are estradiol, estriol, and estrone. From menarke to menopause, the main estrogen is 17\u03b2-estradiol. In the body, all three types of estrogens are made from androgens with the help of enzymes. Estradiol is made from testosterone, while estron is made from androstenadion. Estron is weaker in nature than estradiol, and in postmenopausal women estron is found to be more abundant than estradiol. Various natural and artificial substances have been found to have estrogen-like activities. Artificial substances that are estrogen-like are called xenoestrogens, while natural ingredients from plants that have estrogen-like activity are called phytoestrogens. Estrogen is used as an ingredient in contraceptive pills and is also therapeutic for postmenopausal women. Excessive and cumulative exposure to the hormone estrogen, is thought to increase the risk of developing breast cancer, and endometrial cancer. The classical mechanism of estrogen will affect the trajectory rate of mitosis and apoptosis and translate it into a risk of breast cancer by affecting the growth of epithelial tissue. The very fast rate of cell proliferation will make cells vulnerable to genetic errors in the DNA replication process by reactive oxygen speciation compounds activated by estrogen metabolites. However, phytoestrogens can reduce this risk by competing with estrogen in their absorbers, thereby stimulating the production of sex hormone-carrying globulins and inhibiting the activity of enzymes in the cross-synthesis of estrogens.

This method was invented in 1983 by Kary Mullis, an American biochemist. Broadly speaking, a small number of DNA sequences are propagated exponentially through a series of cycles of temperature changes. Many molecular biology and genetic testing is performed with PCR, for example analysis of ancient DNA samples and identification of infectious agents. Currently, PCR is a common technique that is indispensable in medical laboratories, including for biomedical research and forensic medicine. Most PCRs rely on temperature cycle control machines. This machine makes the reagent materials undergo repeated heating and cooling cycles. This allows for the occurrence of various temperature-dependent chemical reactions, in particular DNA melting and DNA replication. There are two main reagents used in PCR, namely primary (a short single-unting DNA fragment of oligonucleotide] which is a sequence of complements of the target DNA region) and the DNA polymerase enzyme. In the first step, two double helix DNA strands are physically separated at high temperatures in a process called nucleic acid denaturation. In the second step, the temperature is lowered and the primer binds to a complementary DNA sequence. The two DNA inputs then become a template that is affixed with DNA polymerase to assemble new DNA inputs from free nucleotides, dna constituent materials that are added as reagents. As PCR progresses, a self-generated copy of DNA becomes a template for subsequent replication to create a chain reaction. Finally, the original DNA template is amplified (propagated) exponentially. ", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "Almost all PCR applications use heat-resistant DNA polymerase, such as Taq polymerase, an enzyme originally isolated from the thermophilic bacterium Thermus aquaticus. If the polymerase used is sensitive to heat, the enzyme will undergo a change in properties at high temperatures at the denaturation step. Before Taq polymerase is used, the DNA polymerase enzyme must be added manually each cycle making this process tedious and expensive. Applications of this technique include DNA cloning for DNA sequencing, gene manipulation, and gene mutagenesis; DNA-based phylogenetic tree construction or functional analysis of genes; diagnosis and monitoring of hereditary diseases; ancient DNA amplification, analysis of DNA profiles (e.g. in forensic science and parental identification); as well as detection of pathogens to diagnose infectious diseases. The polymerase chain reaction amplifies a specific part of the DNA unting (referred to as the DNA target). Most PCRs amplify DNA fragments that are between 0.1 and 10 kilo long base pairs (kbp), although fragment amplification of up to 40 kbp is also possible. The amount of amplified product is determined by the availability of substrates in the reaction, which becomes more limited as the reaction progresses. Basically, PCR requires several components and reagents, among which these components are usually reacted in the form of a solution of 10\u2013200 \u03bcl in a small test tube (volume 0.2\u20130.5 ml) placed in a temperature cycle regulator. It heats and cools the test tube to reach the required temperature at each reaction step (see below). Many temperature cycle control devices make use of the Peltier effect, which allows heating and cooling blocks that load PCR tubes by simply reversing the electric current. Thin-walled test tubes allow favorable thermal conductivity to achieve rapid thermal equilibrium.

The letter Z comes from the Greek letter zeta, which is derived from the Proto-Semitic (early Semitic) letters. The name of the original Semitic letter is zayin, which probably means \"weapon\", as well as being the seventh letter in the alphabet. The letter is like the pronunciation z in English and French, or most likely like the swipe consonant sound /d\u0361z/ in Italian. The Greek Z (lowercase: \u03b6) is a close relative of the Phoenician letter I, and its letterform in inscriptions has survived throughout antiquity. The Greeks called him zeta, and new names were created based on this letter namely eta (\u03b7) and theta (\u03b8). In early Greek in Athens and North-West Greece, the letter symbolized the sound /dz/; in Attic Greek, from the 4th century BC onwards, the letter could symbolize both /zd/ and /dz/, and in fact there is no consensus paying attention to this issue. In other dialects, such as Elea and Crete, the symbol was once used to signify the sound and voiceless th sounds in English (IPA: /\u00f0/ and /\u03b8/). In the common dialect (Koine Greek) which replaced the previous dialect, \u03b6 symbolize the sound /z/, and survived until Modern Greek. In the Etruscan alphabet, the letter Z may signify the sound of the string consonant /ts/; in Latin anyway, /dz/. In early Latin, the sound /z/ changed to /r/ due to rhotasism so that the letter symbolizing the sound /z/ became useless. So around 300 BC, the letter Z was removed by Censor Appius Claudius Caecus, then its original place was replaced by a new letter, G. In the first century BC, the letter Z was reapplied into the Latin alphabet in order to signify the Greek zeta sound more precisely than the writing of S at the beginning of a word and ss in the middle of a previously applied word, for example:  sona = \u03b6\u03c9\u03bd\u03b7, \"waist cord\"; trapessita = \u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c0\u03b5\u03b6\u03b9\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2, \"banker\".

Z is also often written as a replacement for the consonant I (i.e., J, IPA: /j/) such as zunior for junior, 'younger'.

By 1864, Spain had blockaded the Sultanate's territory in the Sulu Islands. The Sultanate of Sulu granted a plot of land in Sandakan Bay by a former member of the German consular service to protect itself from the Germans. In 1878, the Sultanate sold northeastern Borneo to an Austro-Hungarian consul who then granted the territory to British colonial traders.

As a result, a protocol was signed between Britain, Germany and Spain to recognize Spanish sovereignty over the Sulu Islands, returned to Spain without interfering in British affairs north of Borneo. Sandakan began to triumph when the British North Borneo Company began building a new settlement in 1879, developing it into an active commercial and commercial centre and making it the main administrative centre for North Borneo. The British also organized Chinese migration from British Hong Kong to develop the Sandakan economy. But the glory came to a halt when the Japanese occupied the area.

But sometimes in certain situations communicants cannot receive messages directly, for example in newspaper reporting, communicants and sources separated by time and space. The study of the development of communicants begins with the study of mass communication which has the view that communicants or audiences are passive parties and are easy to be influenced by the information conveyed. This has been proven through hypodermic needle theory and response stimulus theory. According to both theories, the mass media also plays a strong role in influencing communicants or message recipients. Response stimulus theory explains how the communication process simply involves only two components, namely the mass media as communicators and the public as communicants. The mass media in this case sends a stimulus in the form of information conveyed and the communicant will receive the message and give a response.

In 802, Jayavarman declared his new status as \"ruler of the universe\" (chakrawartin), then attributed himself to the worship of Shiva imitated by his successor kings, taking the title of \"dewaraja\". Before the Jayavarman era, Cambodia consisted of several independent kingdoms that were unitarily referred to by the Chinese as the Funan and Chenla states. In 889 AD, King Yasowarman I ascended the throne. This great king was famous for being a great builder. Near the old capital of Hariharalaya, Yasowarman built a new city called Yasodharapura. In keeping with the traditions of his predecessors, he built a large water reservoir called a baray. The meaning of the construction of reservoirs or water reservoirs has become a matter of debate for modern scientists, some consider it as the irrigation infrastructure of rice farming, while others view this huge pond as a religious symbol symbolizing the great ocean in Hindu mythology surrounding mount Mahameru, where the gods reside. The mountain is symbolized by a towering temple, where the \"god-king\" is symbolized by a phallus. Based on the symbolism of this universe, Yasowarman built his temple on a hill called Phnom Bakheng, which is surrounded by a moat whose water flows from baray. He also built several Hindu temples and dormitories as residences for brahmin ascetics. For more than 300 years, from 900 to 1200, the Khmer Monastery built masterpieces of world architecture in the Angkor region.

The un-grinded shape is similar to pepper, like small seeds 1-2 mm in diameter. Coriander has a distinctive aroma. This aroma is due to the chemical components present in the essential oil of coriander. The main component of coriander essential oil is linalool, with other supporting components such as geraniol, geranyl acetate and camphor. In the drug trade he was named fructus coriandri. In English it is known as coriander and in Latin America it is known as cilantro. This plant comes from Southern Europe and around the Caspian Sea. Various types of traditional Indonesian cuisine often use spices in the form of seeds in the form of hard-scented granules called coriander. With the addition of such seasonings, the aroma of the dishes will be more pronounced. Not only the seeds are often used in cooking. Its basil-like leaves are often thinly sliced and sprinkled into dishes such as thai soups and salads. In the country, coriander was given the name phak chee. The same with the seeds, cilantro is also sharply flavored. As a rule, this plant is grown in the gardens of lowland and mountainous areas. This plant can reach 1.3 m in height. The leaves are green with jagged edges. Meanwhile, for the clustered flowers, it is in the form of a white and pink stacked umbrella. For fruits, the shape is almost round in a stacked yellow color, If ripe, the fruit is easy to shed out. After that, the fruit is dried. There, dried seeds. In some regions, coriander is often given different names. All parts of this plant are edible, but fresh leaves and dried seeds make up the most traditionally used parts in cooking.

Its bright stars are located at the celestial equator and are visible from all over the world, thus making this constellation widely known. Orion the hunter stood next to the river Eridanus with his two hunting dogs, Canis Major (big dog) and Canis Minor (small dog), against Taurus, the buffalo. Other hunts such as Lepus, the rabbit, are also nearby. The stars in this constellation are: Orion's main stars are all very similar in terms of both age and physical characteristics, indicating that they may have a common origin. Betelgeuse is the only exception. Orion is very useful in determining the location of other stars. By extending the line from the belt towards the southwest, Sirius (\u03b1 Canis Majoris) can be found; to the northeast is Aldebaran, \u03b1 Tauri. A line eastward through both shoulders points towards Procyon, \u03b1 Canis Minoris. A line from Rigel through Betelgeuse leads to Castor and Pollux, \u03b1 and \u03b2 Geminorum.

As a bright constellation, Orion has been known by various ancient civilizations, albeit with various descriptions. The ancient Sumerians saw this star pattern as a sheep, while in ancient China, Orion was one of the 28 zodiac signs of Xiu (\u5bbf). Known as Shen (\u53c3), which literally means \"three\", this constellation was probably so named because of its three stars located on the belt of Orion. See also Chinese constellations. These stars were considered the Gods of Light, Osiris by the Ancient Egyptians. Orion's \"belt and sword\" is often mentioned in ancient and modern literature, and is also recognized in the shoulder emblem of the American Army's 27th Infantry Division during both world wars. This was probably due to the First Commander of his division being Major General John F. O'Ryan. Austronesian sailors used it as a guiding helper of the west-east imaginary line. Javanese farmers use it as a clue to the start of rice planting in rainfed rice fields. It is not too surprising that this famous constellation has many stories about it in Greek mythology. In one of the versions, Orion considers himself the greatest hunter in the world. This is heard by Hera, Zeus's wife, and she decides to send a scorpion to Orion. Orion was stung to death by the scorpion. Zeus regretted this and put Orion in the sky. The scorpion was also placed in the sky, as the constellation Scorpius.

The Horai are referred to in Illiad as the gatekeepers of the clouds of Zeus.While according to Hesiodos, Zeus married Themis who later gave birth to Eunomia, Dike, and Eirene, goddesses of law and order who maintained the stability of society. They were worshipped mainly in the cities of Athens, Argos and Olympia. And in Homeros' Hymn, they are Thallo, Auxo, and Karpo, the goddesses of the seasons representing spring, summer and autumn. They were worshipped in the countryside mainly among peasants throughout Greece. In the first Horai group (Eunomia, Dike, and Eirene), Dike was the goddess of justice and morals. She has power over human justice while her mother (Themis) has power over the justice of the gods. Dike was born a human being and Zeus put him on earth to keep humanity just. Dike quickly realized that this was impossible and was finally placed together with Zeus on Mount Olimpus. Eunomia is the goddess of law and legislation. Eirene, or Irene is the goddess of peace and wealth, and is depicted in ancient art as a coquettish young woman carrying a cornucopya, a scepter and a torch or rhiton.

Earth's volcanoes formed as their crust split into 17 rigid main tectonic plates and floated over the hotter and softer layers of the mantle. Therefore, volcanoes on Earth are often found at the divergent and convergent boundaries of tectonic plates. Volcanoes usually do not form on the territory of two tectonic plates shifted from each other. The danger of volcanic dust is to flight, especially jet aircraft because the dust can damage the turbines of the jet engine. Large eruptions can affect temperatures because the smoke and sulfuric acid grains spewed out by the eruption can block the sun and cool the bottom of the earth's atmosphere such as the troposphere, but the material can also absorb heat emitted from the earth thus heating the stratosphere. Furthermore, the term \"volcano\" is also used to name the phenomenon of the formation of ice volcanoes and mud volcanoes. Ice volcanoes are common in high latitudes that have snowy winters. Volcanoes are found all over the world, but the most recognizable volcanic locations are those along the Pacific Ring of Fire arc. The Pacific Ring of Fire arc is its swipe line between two and more tectonic plates, where the Pacific Plate rubs against each other with its neighboring plates. Volcanoes can be encountered in several forms throughout their lifetime.

But the volcano is able to rest for a very long time, more than thousands of years before it turns active again. A volcanic eruption occurs when magma rises across the Earth's crust and appears above the surface. When a volcano erupts, the magma contained in the magma chamber below the volcano erupts out as lava, where this lava can turn into lava after flowing and mixing with materials on the earth's surface. Aside from lava flows, destruction caused by volcanic eruptions. The science that studies volcanoes is called Volcanology, where this science studies volcanic eruptions for the purpose of estimating the possibility of eruptions that can occur from a volcano, so that the negative impact of volcanic eruptions can be suppressed. Volcanoes on Earth are formed from the activity of tectonic plates in the crust that rub against each other and press against each other. Therefore volcanoes are found close to the border of tectonic plates. Geologically, the region where the volcano formed is divided into three, namely: If the two tectonic plates move away from each other, a new oceanic crust will be formed from the exit of magma to the surface of the seabed. The region between these two plates that move away from each other is called the divergent boundary. This activity will then give rise to the mid-ocean ridge which is formed from the cooling of magma that comes to the surface. Volcanoes formed from this activity are under the sea, which is characterized by the phenomenon of Hydrothermal ventilation. If this mid-ocean ridge sticks out to sea level, volcanic islands will form, for example, Iceland.

In a monopoly market, there are no other similar goods and no competitors for a company. Sellers on the monopoly market are called monopolists who are single parties. Monopolists have the power and control of the market to determine prices. As a price-maker, a monopolist can increase or decrease prices by determining the number of goods to be produced; The fewer items produced, the more expensive they are, and vice versa. However, sellers also have a limitation in pricing. If pricing is too expensive, people will delay purchases or try to find or make substitutions for the product or\u2014worse\u2014look for it on the black market. The word monopoly tastes from the Greek monos which means itself and polein which means seller. From the root of the word, monopoly is interpreted simply as a condition where there is only one seller who offers or supplies a certain good or service. The monopoly market arises due to the concentration of economic resources on one business actor or seller. Such concentration triggers the mastery of the means of production and marketing of certain types of goods or services. In addition, a monopoly market may arise because it has been established by law. The government can give a company the right to sell a certain product, for example, such as PT Pos Indonesia which is given a monopoly right by the government to sell postal objects and the like. In addition, the merger of various companies to raise large amounts of capital to produce goods with advanced technology can trigger the emergence of a monopoly market.

In connection with social jealousy over office, ranggalawe rebelled against the king, Ranggalawe died as the first rebel in the kingdom's history. His big name is remembered as a hero by the people of Tuban Regency until now. He was one of the most influential figures of his time. Kidung Panji Wijayakrama and Kidung Ranggalawe refer to Ranggalawe as the son of Arya Wiraraja, the regent of Songeneb (old name Sumenep). He himself resides in Tanjung, which is located on the western Madura Island. In 1292 Ranggalawe was sent by his father to help Raden Wijaya open the Tarik Forest (west of present-day Tarik, Sidoarjo) into a residential village called Majapahit. It is said that the name Rangga Lawe itself is a gift from Raden Wijaya because it is related to the provision of 70 horses from Bima as a war vehicle for Raden Wijaya and his followers in the war against Jayakatwang king Kadiri or also has the meaning of rangga meaning knight / royal employee and Lawe is a synonym of arbitrary, which means \"thread\", or it can also mean \"power\" or victory. and Ranggalawe was then given power by Raden Wijaya to lead the clearing of the forest. The attack on the capital Kediri by a combination of Majapahit and Mongol forces occurred in 1293. Ranggalawe was in an army that stormed the eastern fortifications of the city of Kadiri. he managed to kill the leader of the fort named Sagara Winotan. After Kadiri collapsed, Raden Wijaya became the first king of the Majapahit Kingdom. According to Kidung Ranggalawe, for his services in the struggle Ranggalawe was appointed as the regent of Tuban which was the main port of East Java at that time.

The names Arya Adikara and Arya Wiraraja are the names. According to Pararaton, Arya Adikara is another name for Arya Wiraraja. But the Kudadu inscription mentions clearly that the two are the names of two different figures. Historian Slamet Muljana identified Arya Adikara as another name Ranggalawe. In Javanese tradition there is the term nunggak semi, which is the name of the father then used by the child. So, the name Arya Adikara, which is another name for Arya Wiraraja, was later used as the name of Ranggalawe's title when he was appointed as a Majapahit official. In the Kudadu inscription, the father and son both served as pairs, both of which were titled Rakryan Mantri Arya Wiraraja Makapramuka and Rakryan Mantri Dwipantara Arya Adikara, respectively. Pararaton said the Ranggalawe rebellion occurred in 1295, but it is told after the death of Raden Wijaya. According to this text, the rebellion coincided with Jayanagara ascending the throne. According to Nagarakretagama, Raden Wijaya died and was replaced by Jayanagara in 1309. As a result, some historians argue that the Ranggalawe rebellion occurred in 1309, not 1295. It's as if the author of Pararaton made a mistake in the mention of the year number. However, Nagarakretagama also tells that in 1295 Jayanagara was appointed as a yuwaraja or \"viceroy\" at the Daha court. In addition, Kidung Panji Wijayakrama and Kidung Ranggalawe clearly tell that the Ranggalawe rebellion occurred during the reign of Raden Wijaya, not Jayanagara. Another fact shows that the names Arya Wiraraja and Arya Adikara are both found in the Kudadu inscription of 1294, but later both are no longer found in the Sukamreta inscription of 1296.

These epileptic attacks can range from brief and almost undetectable attacks to strong shocks for long periods of time. In epilepsy, attacks tend to recur, and there is no direct underlying cause while attacks caused by specific causes are not considered representative of epilepsy. In Indonesian is used the term \"ayan disease\" for various cases of epilepsy. In most cases, the cause is unknown, although some people suffer from epilepsy as a result of brain injuries, strokes, brain cancer, and drug and alcohol abuse, among others. Epileptic seizures are the result of excessive and abnormal activity of cortical nerve cells inside the brain. The diagnosis usually includes getting rid of other conditions that may be causing similar symptoms (such as syncope) as well as finding out if there are any direct causes. Epilepsy can often be confirmed by electroencephalography (EEG). Epilepsy cannot be cured, but attacks can be controlled with treatment in about 70% of cases. For those whose attacks are not responsive to treatment, surgery, nerve stimulation or changes in food intake can be considered. Not all symptoms of epilepsy last a lifetime, and a large number of people experience improvement even to the point that treatment is no longer needed. Epilepsy as well as tuberculosis treatment must be complete, even if it seems to be healthy. In epilepsy treatment is stopped one year after the last attack. About 1% of the world's population (65 million) suffer from epilepsy, and almost 80% of cases appear in developing countries. Epilepsy becomes more common with age.

Epilepsy is characterized by a long-term risk for the occurrence of recurrent attacks. These attacks can occur in several ways depending on which part of the brain is involved and the age of the sufferer. The most common type of epileptic seizure (60%) is convulsions/seizures. Of these attacks, two-thirds start with focal seizure attacks (which can then become common) while a third start with generalized seizure attacks. The remaining 40% of other types of attacks are non-convulsive. An example of this type is the absans attack, which indicates the presence of a decrease in the level of consciousness and usually lasts about 10 seconds. Focal epileptic seizures often begin with a specific experience, known as aura. These can include: sensory phenomena (seeing, listener or speaker), psychic, autonomic, or motor. Cramps can start with a specific group of muscles and spread to surrounding muscle groups known as Jacksonian epileptic seizures. Automatism can happen; These are unconscious movements and most repetitive movements are simple like playing lips or more complex movements like trying to pick something up. There are six main types of generalized epileptic seizures: tonic-clonic, tonic, clonic, myoclonic, absans, and atonic attacks. All of them involve loss of consciousness and usually occur without warning. Tonic-clonic attacks occur with contractions of the limbs followed by extensions accompanied by a backward arched back that lasts for 10\u201330 seconds (tonic phase).

The aviation industry remains one of the last users of teletypes and in some situations still sends messages over SITA or AFTN networks. For example, The British Airways (FICO) computer operating system in 2004, still uses teletypes to communicate with other airline companies' computer systems. The same goes for the Programmed Airline Reservation System (PARS) and IPARS which use a shifted six-bit teletype code, as it only requires eight bits per character, saving bandwidth and money. Teletype messages are often much smaller compared to equivalent EDIFACT or XML messages. In recent years airlines have had access to increased bandwidth in remote locations, the IATA XML standard is replacing Teletype as well as EDI.

It is one of the common types of eating behaviors that include parasitism and micro-predation (which do not usually kill the host) and parasitoidism (which in the end is always so). It differs from scavenging on dead prey, although many predators also scavenge. It overlaps with herbivores because seed predators and frugivors of a destructive nature are predators. Predators can vigorously search, chase or wait for often hidden prey. When a prey is tracked, the predator judges whether to attack it or not. This can sometimes be accompanied by an ambush or pursuit after stalking the prey. If the attack is successful, the predator kills its prey, discards inedible parts, such as shells or thorns, and eats them. Predators adapt to keen senses, such as sight, hearing, or smell that are often highly devoted to hunting. Many predatory animals, both vertebrates, and invertebrates, have sharp claws or jaws to grip, kill, and tear their prey. Other adaptations include aggressive and stealthy mimicry that increases the usefulness of hunting. Predation has a very strong picking effect on prey so that prey develops anti-predatory adaptations, such as warning colors, call red flags and other cues, disguise, mimicry of well-defended species, barbs and defensive chemicals. Predators and prey sometimes experience evolutionary arms races, adaptation cycles, and opposite adaptations. Predation has been the main driver of evolution since at least the Cambrian period. At the most basic level, predators kill and feed on other organisms. However, the concept of predation is very broad, defined differently in different contexts and includes a variety of feeding methods, as well as some relationships that do not result in the death of prey are generally not called predation. ", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "Parasitoids such as ikneumon wasps, lay eggs inside or on their host. Then, the eggs hatch into larvae that feed on their host and over time will die. Animal science experts generally refer to this as parasitism, although ordinary parasites are thought not to kill their hosts. A predator can be defined differently from a parasitoid because a predator has a lot of prey caught during its lifetime and the paradoid larva has only one or at least one food supply for it on only one occasion. There are other things that are difficult and limited. Micro-predators are small predator-like animals that feed entirely on other organisms. These animals include pinjal and mosquitoes that feed on blood from living animals, and aphids that feed on sap from living plants. However, this animal is now often considered a parasite because it usually does not kill its host. An animal that grazes on phytoplankton or microbial mats is a predator because it feeds on and kills the organisms it eats, but grass-encroaching herbivores are excluded, since the plants it eats usually survive such attacks. When an animal eats seeds (seed predation or granivor) or eggs (predation of eggs), these animals feed on entire living organisms, which makes them predators by definition. Pebangkai, organisms that only eat organisms that are found to be dead, are not predators, but many predators such as jakal and dubuk scavenge when the opportunity arises. Among invertebrates, social wasps (yellow-skinned) are hunters and insectizers of other insects. While examples of predators among lactating animals and birds are well known, predators can be found in a variety of taxons including arthropods. The beast is common among insects, including sentadu grasshoppers, dragonflies, lacewing insects, and scorpion flies. In some species such as the alder fly, only the larvae are preying because the adult ones do not eat.

The differences between the two types of fish include: salmon migrate, while trout live sedentary. Salmon lives in the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. In general, salmon is an anadromous species, that is, a species that migrates for breeding. Salmon are born in freshwater waters, migrate to the sea, then return to fresh water to reproduce. There is a belief that salmon always returns to the place where it was born for breeding. Research shows so, but why it happens and how salmon can store those memories is still a mystery. Salmon return to the flowing freshwater waters (rivers) for breeding. His method of navigation is probably done with the sense of smell. Half the number of adult salmon will die within a few days to several weeks after breeding. Before laying the eggs, the female salmon flaps her tail to create a low-pressure region that can lift the pebbles to be swept away by the current, creating an opening for her to put the eggs. One gap can hold 5000 eggs, covering an area of about 2.8 m\u00b2. The color of eggs varies from orange to red. One or more male salmon will approach the female salmon and expel their sperm into the water to fertilize the eggs. The female salmon then covers her eggs by sweeping the pebbles and then going to lay eggs elsewhere. The female salmon can do it as many as seven times before the eggs in her ovary are exhausted. Salmon will die of exhaustion immediately after laying eggs. Eggs should be laid under gravel around cold water with a good current as an oxygen supply.

Adult salmon will return to its birthplace for breeding. In the process of going in that direction, some types of salmon develop fangs. Their color will darken. The distance on which salmon travels is amazing; They can wade through the current of the river for 1,400 km and climb as high as 2,100 m from the sea to where they were born. During their stay in fresh and estuarine water, young salmon feed on insects, amphipods and crustaceans. When they grow up, they will eat small fish. Salmon populations in nature have steadily declined in this decade, especially Atlantic salmon that breeds in Western Europe and eastern parts of Canada. Causative factors include: To produce high quality in salmon cultivation, the selected female adult salmon brood is capable of producing about 10,000 eggs, which are fertilized and incubated in a controlled tank temperature of a freshwater hatchery. After hatching, salmon babies are nurtured in the hatchery for up to 18 months. At this age, young salmon then begin to smoltify - a natural process in the form of physiological changes that allow them to live in salt water. After this process is complete, smolts or salmon measuring approximately 10 \u2013 12 cm in length and weighing 100g, are transferred from hatching to floating net pens in the sea.

Vertebrates, including humans, have two ovaries that function to produce eggs and secrete hormones. The egg in females (humans) is located inside on the left and right of the hip. The egg that is produced if not fertilized over time will dry out, and stick to the wall of the uterus. Over time the egg will fall out, and come out through the vagina. Most birds have only one ovary that can function properly, and snakes have two ovaries arranged in a row. Inside each ovary occurs the development of an egg (oogenesis). In this process the egg will be accompanied by a group of cells called follicular cells whose development is stimulated by FSH. In humans, the development of oogenesis from oogonium to oocyte occurs in embryos in the womb and oocytes will not develop into the ovum until the start of puberty. At puberty, the mature ovum will be released from the follicular cells and removed from the ovaries. The process of release from the ovaries is called ovulation. Ovum cells are ready to be fertilized by spermatozoa cells of the male, which apaabila successfully merge will form a zygote. The ovaries function to secrete steroid hormones and peptides such as estrogen and progesterone.

According to Euripides, Quintus Smyrnaeus and others, Mygdon's son Coroebus fought and died in the Trojan War; he had actually proposed to Trojan daughter, Cassandra, to be his wife. The name Otreus could be the \"eponymous\" for Otroea, a place on Lake Ascania near the later city of Nicaea, while the name Mygdon is clearly the eponym for the \"Mygdon people\", who according to Strabo lived in the northwest of Asia Minor, and were once considered different from the Phrygians.

The city was built by Herod the Great around 25-13 BC as part of the port city, which is also called Kaisarea Maritima (Greek: \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u039a\u03b1\u03b9\u03c3\u03ac\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1, Kaisarea Palestine (Caesarea Palaestina) since 133 AD). The modern city of Caesarea had a population of about 4500 people in December 2007. The only territory in Israel that is administered by a private organization, the Caesarea Development Corporation, and one of the most populous is not recognized as a local council in Israel, but rather falls under the jurisdiction of the Hof HaCarmel Regional Council. Caesarea is believed to have been built on the ruins of the Stratonospyrgos (Straton Tower), erected by Straton I of Sidon, and was originally an agricultural granary. In 90 BC, Alexander Jannaeus seized the Tower of Straton as part of his policy to develop the shipbuilding industry and expand the Hasmonean empire. The Tower of Straton became a Jewish city for 2 generations, until the Roman Empire captured it in 63 BC and made it an autonomous city. It then underwent great changes under the rule of Herod the Great, who named him 'Caesarea in honor of the Roman Emperor, Augustus. In 22 BC, Herod began building deep-water ports and warehouses, markets, highways, public baths, temples for Rome and Augustus, and large public buildings. Every 5 years sports matches, gladiators and plays are held in the rink (Roman Theater) overlooking the Mediterranean Sea. Herod built his palace on a peninsula that jutted out to sea and decorated it with a swimming pool surrounded by stoics (passages with pillars beside them).

King Herod built 2 moles, or breakwaters, for this pier between 22 and 15 BC, and in 10/9 BC he dedicated this city and its harbor to Emperor Augustus. Sebastos is the Greek name for Augustus. The speed of this development is amazing considering its size and complexity. Mole is constructed of limestone and pozzolana, a type of volcanic ash, which is formed into concrete under the sea. Herod imported over 24,000 m3 of pozzolana from Pozzuoli, Italy, to build more than 500 meters of breakwater in the southern part and 275 meters in the northern part of the pier. A shipment of this size approximately requires 44 shiploads of 400 tons each. Herod also provided 12,000 m3 of Eolianite (or kurkar) excavated to become building stones and 12,000 m3 of limestone to mix with pozzolana. The city was described in detail by Flavius Josephus, Roman-Jewish historian in the 1st century AD. Soon after its completion, it became the location of the Roman Prefect (= governor or mayor) office. In 13 BC, Caesarea became the civil and military capital of the province of Iudaea. Josephus records his port as large as Piraeus, the main pier of the Greek city of Athens. Caesarea became the \"administrative capital\" beginning in 6 AD as well as the official residence of Roman governors, among others the prefect Pontius Pilate and the procurator Antonius Feliks. It grew rapidly to become the largest city in Judea, with a population of about 125,000 people in a city area of 37 square kilometres (14 sq mi).

When Apollo was sentenced to serve as a human being for murdering Delfin, Apollo stayed at Admetoso's house and became his shepherd. In return, Apollo made all of Admetos' cows give birth to twins during the pherding by Apollo. Apollo also helped Ademtos marry Alkestis, the daughter of Pelias, king of Iolkus. Alkestis was in demand by so many men that Pelias made an impossible task for Alkestis enthusiasts, they had to drive a carriage pulled by wild boars and lions. With the help of Apollo, Admetos managed to do so and married Alkestis. On the day of his marriage, Admetos refused to make an offering to Artemis so the goddess filled their bridal chamber with snakes. Apollo once again helped Admetos. Apollo also advised Admetos to make an offering to Artemis so that the goddess would eliminate her snakes. Apollo's greatest help to Admetos was when Apollo persuaded the Goddesses of destiny to postpone Admetos' death. Apollo gets the Goddesses of destiny drunk until they agree to suspend Admetos' death as long as anyone is willing to die in his place. At first Admetos' parents wanted to die in their son's place but when the appointed day came, they did not want to die. It was Alkestis, the wife of Admetos, who was then willing to die for her husband. After Alkestis dies, Admetos realizes that his life is meaningless without his wife and hopes Alkestis comes back to life. At that time Herakles, who was in the task of capturing the Mare of Diomedes, rested at the residence of Admetos and was well entertained by Admetos.

They are integrated enough that coordinating policies is invaluable, although constituent cities retain their respective identities. The concept of megapolitan became very influential because it introduced new thinking on a larger scale about urban patterns and growth. The term megalopolis, sometimes also spelled megapolis, is described as of Greek origin \u2014 reported by ancient philosophers, relating to the world of ideas by Jean Gottmann, professor of political science at the University of Paris, and a member of the Institute for Advanced Studies at Princeton, which in the late 1950s and early 1960s directed \"A Study of Megalopolis\" for The Twentieth Century Fund. In particular, the term has an earlier geographical definition dating back to 1832, when its meaning was \"a metropolis,\" that is, \"a very large and densely populated urban complex,\" which is recorded as being of Greek origin; M\u00e9gas, which means \"big\", and P\u00f3lis, means \"city\". The Online Etymology Dictionary notes that the term was used \"in classical times as an epithet of the great cities (Athens, Sirakusa, Alexandria)\", that is, for the major cities of those times, and it was \"the name of the former city in Arkadia\". Jean Gottmann, in his extensive study, applied the term megalopolis to an analysis of the northeastern coastal areas of the United States that were urbanized, specifically from Boston, Massachusetts all the way to Washington, D.C. (now often referred to as the Northeast Corridor). He chose the term megalopolis in consultation with classical experts, noting his earlier use \"with very different meanings\" (other than by the ancients), by Lewis Mumford in connection with the general trend in history and geography \"towards the great cities\").

In 1994, William S. Ellis and the editors of National Geographic, writing about the city of Boston, asserted that Gottmann since 1961 using the term northeast for megalopolis was the first special use of the term with the subtle meaning of merging several urban areas into larger areas. Yoav Hagler, writing in 2009 for the American Project 2050 of the Regional Plan Association (RPA) and similarly in introducing the term historically, declared megalopolis to be the precursor to the RPA preferred term for the example of the United States, i.e. \"megaregion\". Pedagogically, the term \"supercity\" has been offered as a synonym for both terms. According to an assistant professor of Siranusa University; Lydia Kallipoliti (and her students, quoting from Volker Welter's \u2013 Biopolis: Patrick Geddes and the City of Life), the term megalopolis was coined by Patrick Geddes in his 1915 book, Cities in Evolution, and that it was later used by Oswald Spengler in his 1918 book, The Decline of the West. Megalopolises are often referred to as Megapolises. Both are derived from \u03bc\u03ad\u03b3\u03b1\u03c2 (m\u00e9gas) which in Greek means \"big\" and \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2 (p\u00f3lis) which means \"city\", so overall it has the meaning of \"big city\". Literally, a megalopolis in Greek is a very large city because the prefix megalo- indicates a large size. Megalopolis is also an Ancient Greek city formed by the Arkadian League by uniting small communities. Megalopolises, also known as megaregions or in Indonesian called megapolitans, are a network of clustered cities. Jean Gottmann explained that the megalopolis must have a population of 25 million.

She is also shown breastfeeding pharaohs through the New Kingdom and becoming a goddess of lust in the following years. In later periods, she is connected with kauri, especially her shell, which resembles a vagina. She was originally Ra's daughter, but was always concerned with Satis in some way. For example, the two goddesses are called \"Eye of Ra\", along with Bastet, Hathor, and Sekhmet. The two of them are also related in some ways to Uraeus. Anuket is part of a triad with the god Khnum, and the goddess Satis. She may have been the sister of the goddess Satis or she may have been the young consort of Khnum. A temple dedicated to Anuket was erected on Sehel Island. The inscription indicates that a temple or altar was dedicated to him at this site by the pharaoh Sobekhotep III of the XIIIth Dynasty. Later during the XVIIIth Dynasty, Amenhotep II dedicated a chapel to the goddess. During the New Kingdom, the cult of Anuket in Elefantin included the procession of the goddess' river during the first month of Shemu. The inscription mentions the festival of Khnum and Anuket processions during this period. When the Nile begins its annual flood, the Annuquet festival begins.

The Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church severed each other's communion in the East\u2013West Schism in 1054, while the Protestant Christian family emerged during the 16th century reformation as a fragment of the Catholic Church.

In the Greek version of the Bible called the Septuagint, the term equivalent, phylistiim appears 12 times, also in the Pentateuch. Nothing is known for certain about the language spoken by the Philistines. Pottery fragments from the period around 1500-1000 BC have been found to contain inscriptions in non-Semitic languages, including one pottery written in Cyprus-Minoan script. The Bible does not mention the language problem between the Israelites and the Philistines, as was the case with other groups until the occupation by Assyria and Babylonia. Later, Nehemiah 13:23-24 writes under Achaemenids records that when Judean men married women from the cities of Moab, Ammon, and Philistines, half of the descendants of Judean marriages to women from Asdod could only speak their mother tongue, A\u0161d\u00f4d\u00eet, not Judean Hebrew (Yeh\u00fbd\u00eet); although at the time this language was probably a dialect of Aramaic. There is some limited evidence to support the assumption that the Philistines were originally Ancient Indo-European speakers, perhaps speakers of Ancient Greek or Luwian from coastal Asia Minor, based on some philistine-related words found in the Bible do not appear to be related to other Semitic languages. Such theories suggest that Semitic elements in the language were borrowed from their neighbors in the region.

The procedure for the formation of laws and regulations consists of five stages, starting with the planning stage, the preparation stage, the discussion stage, the ratification or determination stage, and finally the promulgation stage. Laws and regulations are a source mainly for the implementation of law and the state in Indonesia. Laws and regulations in Indonesia are divided into several types that are arranged in the form of hierarchies according to the force of the law. Laws and regulations in Indonesia must be based on Pancasila, which is the source of all sources of state law. This makes all Indonesian laws and regulations that are made must place Pancasila as the basis and ideology of the state as well as the philosophical basis of the state, and any material content in the laws and regulations must not conflict with the values contained in Pancasila. Legislation consists of several types of regulations, and each regulation is organized based on its legal force into a hierarchy. The hierarchy of laws and regulations is the tiering of each type of legislation based on the principle that lower laws and regulations must not conflict with higher laws and regulations. The following is the hierarchy of the latest laws and regulations according to the \"Law on the Establishment of Laws and Regulations\" (Law No.12 of 2011). From the hierarchy of laws and regulations, there are only a few specific regulations that can have material content regarding criminal provisions, namely laws, provincial regulations, and regency/city regulations. In addition to the regulations listed in the hierarchy above, there are regulations that are recognized for their existence and their legal force is binding, but they are made as long as they are ordered by higher laws and regulations or formed on the basis of authority (the administration of certain government affairs in accordance with the provisions of laws and regulations).

However, the placement does not intend to make the promulgation of the 1945 Constitution the basis for its enactment as is the case with the Act. The provisions of the People's Consultative Assembly are rules in the form of beschikkings ratified by the People's Consultative Assembly of the Republic of Indonesia. Amendments to the 1945 Constitution have implications for the position, duties, and authorities of the MPR. The MPR, which was once the highest state institution, is now domiciled as a state institution equivalent to other state institutions (such as the Presidency, DPR, DPD, BPK, MA, and MK). Thus, the MPR can now only determine provisions that are decisive, namely appointing the Vice President to be the President, choosing the Vice President if there is a vacancy in the position of Vice President, and choosing the President and Vice President if the President and Vice President die, quit, are dismissed, or cannot perform their obligations during their term of office together.

The third is an astrological treatise known as Tetrabiblos (\"Four books\") in which he seeks to adapt horoscope astrology to Aristotelian natural philosophy. He also preserved a list of ancient kings, called the \"Canons of Ptolemaeus\", which was important for the study of Middle Eastern history. Claudius was the nomen (surname) of a Roma; Ptolemaeus bears the name, thus becoming evidence that he was a citizen of Rome. As is customary, the first Ptolemy to become a citizen (whether it was him or his ancestors) took the name from a Roman named Klaudius, thus earning him citizenship status. If this Roman were emperor, citizenship would already be granted between 41 and 68 AD. (the time when Claudius, then Nero, served emperor). The astronomer also had a praenomen (first name), which remains unknown. But, it is likely Tiberius, since the praenomen was very common among the families granted citizenship by this emperor. Ptolemaeus is a Greek name. Appears once in Greek mythology, in the form of Homeric. It was quite common among the upper sol classes of Macedonia at the time of Alexander the Great, and there were several among Alexander's army, one of whom in 323 B.C. made himself King of Egypt: Ptolemy I Soter; all kings after him, until Egypt became a province of Rome in 30 B.C., were also of the Ptolemaic dynasty.

However, unlike other burial texts, Amduat was created only for pharaohs (exclusively up to the Twenty-First Dynasty) or much-liked nobles. The content tells the story of Ra, the Egyptian sun god who travels through the underworld, from the moment the sun sets in the west and rises again in the east. It is said that the deceased Pharaoh went on the same journey, eventually becoming one with Ra and living forever. The underworld is divided into twelve hours of night, each representing a different ally and enemy that the Pharaoh/sun god faces. Amduat called all the names of these gods and monsters. The main purpose of Amduat was to give the names of these gods and monsters to the spirits of the deceased Pharaoh, so that he could summon them for help or use their names to subdue them. As well as naming and naming the inhabitants of Duat, good and bad, the illustrations of this work clearly show the topography of the underworld. The earliest full version of Amduat is found in KV34, the tomb of Thutmosis III in the Valley of the Kings. Amduat tells the story of the nocturnal journey of the sun beneath the earth, from its beginning under the western horizon at night to its reappearance at dawn in the East. There are twelve sections where one section equals one hour of night.

Because of this task, Amaterasu was an important goddess (\u795e; kami) in Shinto belief; the emperors of Japan are said to have a lineage from Amaterasu. The story of Amaterasu is first mentioned in Kojiki (ca. 680 AD) and Nihon Shoki (ca. 720 AD), the oldest records of Japanese Mythology. It is mentioned that Amaterasu is the goddess of the sun, the elder brother of Tsukuyomi, the * of the moon, and Susanoo, the god of storms and the sea. The three of them are the last three gods born when Izanagi, the god who created the island of Japan, performed a self-cleansing ritual after a failed attempt to save his wife, Izanami of Yomi (underworld): Amaterasu was born when Izanagi washed his left eye, Tsukuyomi was born when Izanagi washed his right eye, and Susanoo was born when Izanagi washed his nose. Since Izanagi was still mourning the fate that befell his wife, he further gave Amaterasu a mandate to lead the universe. According to these records, Amaterasu later became the leader of the sun and Takamagahara (paradise) with her sister and husband, Tsukuyomi. Initially, the two of them share the sky, but after an incident where Tsukuyomi who was sent to represent Amaterasu in a party kills Uke-Mochi, the goddess of food, because of Uke-Mochi's way of creating disgusting food, Amaterasu gets angry and labels Tsukuyomi as an evil god and distances himself as far away from Tsukuyomi; It is for this reason that day and night never appear together. Kojiki and Nihon-Shoki's accounts also tell of Amaterasu's rivalry with his other sister, Susanoo. When Izanagi orders Susanoo to leave Takamagahara for Earth, Susanoo intends to say goodbye to Amaterasu. Knowing his imposter and cruel nature, Amaterasu is suspicious, but he agrees with his sister's challenge to prove his honesty.

Amaterasu claims the five gods are his while the three goddesses belong to Susanoo; he decided he won because Susanoo's sword gave birth to a woman. The two gods calmed down for a while until Susanoo, in her anxiety, went on a rampage and destroyed Amaterasu's rice field and threw a skinned pony at her brother's weaving machine, killing one of Amaterasu's servants. Wrathful, Amaterasu hides in a cave called Ama-no-Iwato, hiding the sun for a long time. The persuasion of the gods to go out was ignored by Amaterasu until the gods were invoked: the mirror of Yata-no-Kagami would be hung on a tree outside the cave while the goddess Ama-no-Uzume would perform a naked dance nearby. Hearing the laughter of the god who saw Ama-no-Uzume caught Amaterasu's attention, and when he came out, he saw the image of himself in the mirror. In amaterasu's shock, the god Ame-no-Kajitarawo immediately closed Ama-no-Iwato so that Amaterasu could not enter again. The exit of Amaterasu made the sun shine again on the universe. Although Amaterasu can be lured out again, Susanoo is still driven to Earth because of her actions. After killing the snake Yamata-no-Orochi, Susanoo gives Amaterasu a peace gift: the Kusanagi sword he encounters on the snake's tail. According to legend, Amaterasu later had a grandson named Ninigi, the son of Ame-no-Oshihomimi-no-Mikoto. Amaterasu commissioned Ninigi to come down to Earth and plant rice there and gave him three of his possessions: the Kusanagi sword, the Yata-no-Kagami mirror, and the jewel Yasakani no Magatama.

This theory has both included and replaced the Continent Shift Theory first proposed in the first half of the 20th century and the concept of seafloor spreading developed in the 1960s. In summary, because the outermost part of the earth's interior is formed by two layers. At the top there is a lithosphere consisting of a crust and the top of the earth's mantle whose contents are rigid and dense. Under the lithospheric layer is the asthenosphere which is solid but can flow like a liquid very slowly and in a very long geological time scale due to its low viscosity and shear strength. Even deeper, the part of the mantle under the asthenosphere becomes even more rigid. The cause is not colder temperatures, but high pressure. The lithospheric layer is divided into tectonic plates. On earth, there are seven main plates and many smaller plates. These lithospheric plates hitch a ride over the asthenosphere. They move relative to each other at the boundaries of the plate, either divergent (away), convergent (collide), or transform (sideways). Earthquakes, volcanic activity, mountain formation, and oceanic trough formation all generally occur in areas along plate boundaries. Lateral movement of the plates is usually at speeds of 50\u2013100 mm/a. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, geologists assumed that the main appearances of the earth were fixed. Most geological appearances such as mountains can be explained by the vertical movement of the crust as described in geosyncline theory. Since 1596, it has been observed that the coasts of the Atlantic Ocean facing the African and European continents with North America and South America have similarities in shape and seem to have once been one. ", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "This precision will be even more apparent if we look at the edges of the continental exposure there. Since that time many theories have been put forward to explain this, but all of them are deadlocked because the assumption that the earth is fully solid complicates the discovery of a suitable explanation. The discovery of radium and its heating properties in 1896 prompted a reassessment of the earth's age, as previously estimates were derived from its cooling rate and assuming the earth's surface was irradiated like a black object. From these calculations it can be concluded that even if at first the earth was a red-incandescent object, the temperature of the Earth would decrease to what it is now in a few tens of millions of years. With this newly discovered heat source, scientists think it makes sense that the Earth is actually much older and the core is still hot enough to be in a liquid state. The theory of Plate Tectonics comes from the Continental Drift Hypothesis proposed by Alfred Wegener in 1912. and was further developed in his book The Origin of Continents and Oceans published in 1915. He suggests that the continents that now exist used to be a single entity moving away, releasing them from the earth's core like 'chunks of ice' from low-density granite floating over denser basalt oceans. However, in the absence of detailed evidence and calculations of the forces involved, this theory is marginalized. It is possible that the earth has a dense crust and a liquid core, but it seems that it is still unlikely that parts of the crust can twitch. Later, it was proved by the theory put forward by British geologist Arthur Holmes in 1920 that the links of these parts of the crust were likely under the sea.

This substance comes from the endocrine glands and is used by living beings to recognize the same sex, other individuals, groups, and to aid the reproductive process. In contrast to hormones, pheromones spread outside the body and can only affect and be recognized by other similar individuals (one species). The first pheromone was discovered in Germany by Adolph Butenandt, a scientist who also discovered sexual hormones in humans namely estrogen, progesterone and testosterone. When it was first discovered in insects, pheromones were widely associated with the reproductive function of insects. Scientists first saw pheromones as the equivalent of perfumes in the human world. Pheromone substances were first discovered by Jean-Henri Fabre in insects in the spring of the 1870s. He observed a female great peacock-type moth coming out of the cocoon and placed in a wire cage on his study table, then he saw at night dozens of male moths gathered around the wire cage on his study table. \"They come from all over, without me knowing how they found the female on my desk ... \" wrote Fabre. Fabre spent the following years studying how male moths found their females. Fabre came to the conclusion that female moths produce certain chemical substances whose aroma attracts male moths. With this conclusion of Fabre, began new research on pheromones researched. When a male or female butterfly flaps its wings, that's when the pheromone spreads through the air and invites the opposite sex to approach sexually. Sexual pheromones have properties specific to biological activity when males or females of other species will not respond to pheromones secreted by females or males of different species. ", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "To be able to detect the path they are exploring, the termite individual in front emits trail following pheromone pheromone that comes out of the sternal gland (sternal gland at the bottom, back of the abdomen), which can be detected by termites behind it. The chemical properties of this pheromone are so closely related to the smell of food that termites are able to detect their food objects. In addition to trace marker pheromones, termite ethologists (behavioral) experts also consider that the colony arrangement is under the control of basic pheromones (primary pheromones). For example, the inhibition of neoten growth/formation is caused by the presence of some kind of basic pheromone secreted by the queen, which serves to inhibit genital differentiation. As soon as the queen dies, these pheromones disappear so that neoten-neoten substitutes for the queen are formed. But then the neoten that has been formed again secretes the same pheromones so that the formation of more neoten can be inhibited. Basic pheromones also play a role in the differentiation of the formation of the worker caste and the warrior caste, which is issued by the reproductive caste. Judging from its biology, termite colonies themselves are considered by some experts to be supra-organisms, that is, the colonies themselves are considered living beings, while the termite individuals in the colony are only part of the limbs of that supra-organism. The comparison of the number of neotens, soldiers and workers in one colony is usually not fixed. Thriving colonies have very many workers with a small number of soldiers (approximately 2 - 4 percent). A colony that experiences a lot of disturbances, for example because there are many ants around it will form more soldiers (7 - 10 percent), because it is necessary to defend the nest. Communication through pheromones is very widespread in the insect family. Pheromones act as a means of sexual lure between females and males.

They can be said to be a continuation of the Catholic Church in their respective territories. In principle, Lutheranism only rejects things within the Roman Catholic Church that are considered blatantly forbidden in the Bible. The Reformed Church went so far as to take only from the Roman Catholic Church the things they considered to be based from the Bible. Each strives to be a church for the whole community.

This writing is called \"Night Writing\" and is named after Braille. Braille at that time did not have the letter W. The emergence of inspiration to create letters that could be read by the blind originated with a former napoleonic artillery officer, Captain Charles Barbier. Barbier used ciphers in the form of lines and embossed dots to give messages or orders to his soldiers in the dark conditions of night. The message is read by fingering a series of combinations of lines and points arranged into a sentence. Such a system became known as night writing. In order to suit the needs of the visually impaired, Louis Braille conducted a trial of Barbier's line and embossment points to several blind friends. In reality, the fingers of their hands are more sensitive to dots than lines so that in the end Braille letters only use a combination of dots and blank spaces or spaces. The Braille writing system was first used at the L'Institution Nationale des Jeunes Aveugles, Paris, in order to teach visually impaired students. Controversy over the usefulness of Braille in France had arisen, leading to the dismissal of Dr. Pignier as head of the institution and the ban on the use of Braille writing where Louis taught.

In those days, they regularly met with a spiritual guide who helped them understand God's call or message through their meditation. This retreat follows the pattern of Purification-Enlightenment-Unity in accordance with the mystical tradition of John Casian and the Desert Fathers. Ignatius created an innovation that made this contemplative mysticism possible for everyone to follow, and used it as a means of rebuilding the spiritual life of the Church. The Jesuits also founded many schools, which attracted the children of the elites because of their advanced teaching methods and high morale. Jesuit schools played an important role in winning some European countries back to Catholicism, after a period of being dominated by Protestants, especially Poland In accordance with Roman Catholic tradition, they taught the use of ceremonies and decorations in Catholic rituals and Devotions.

Each key connects to the hammer inside the piano and presses the strings inside, resulting in a sound. Each string is of different length and produces a different sound. The piano is played with the fingers of the hands. Piano players are called pianists. At the time of its early creation, the sound of the piano was not as loud as that of the XX-century piano, like the piano made by Bartolomeo Cristofori (1655 \u2013 1731) made in 1720. The reason is that the tension of the piano strings at that time was not as strong as it is now. Today the piano is on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Although who was the first inventor of the piano, originally nicknamed the gravecembalo col piano e forte (harpsichord with soft and loud-sounding keyboards), is still a matter of debate, many people admit, Bartolomeo Cristofori as its creator. The piano is also not the first instrument to use a keyboard and work with being hit. Piano-like working principled musical instruments have been around since 1440. The piano itself was born out of a desire to combine the beauty of clavichord tones with the power of the harpsichord. That passion prompted Marius of Paris (1716), Schroter of Saxony (1717), and Cristofori (1720) of Padova, Italy, to make pianos. However, the full and complete results are only shown by Bartolomeo Christofori. It is from the pianos created by harpsichord keepers and spinets (small harpsichords) in the Florentine Palace - the residence of Prince Ferdinand de'Medici - this is the modern piano taking root. In the middle of the XVII century pianos were made in several forms. Initially, there was a similar harpsichord design, with strings looming. The piano became lower after John Isaac Hawkins modified its location to be floor level.

Until 1860 this square piano dominated the use of pianos at home. The frame for the first piano strings used a wooden frame and could withstand only light tension from the strings. As a result, when in the XIX century large concert halls were built, the sound of the piano was inadequate. So, began to make a piano with an iron frame. Around 1800 Joseph Smith of England made a piano with a metal frame entirely. The piano as a result of his innovation is able to withstand very strong string tensions, so the sound produced is louder. Around 1820, many makers used metal pieces for other piano parts. In 1822, the Erard brothers patented a double escapement action, which was the most famous find ever relating to the workings of the piano. In its development, before it had 88 keys as it is now, the piano had five octaves and 62 keys. It is also equipped with knee-driven pedals. However, later foot pedals introduced in England became popular until now. A number of developments continued in the XIX and XX centuries. The string voltage, originally set at 16 tons in 1862, increased to 30 tons on modern pianos. The result was a piano with a ton-producing ability that Frederic Chopin, Ludwig van Beethoven, and even Franz Liszt had never imagined. Basically, pianos can be distinguished into: acoustic pianos and electronic pianos. Acoustic pianos use strings struck by hammers to produce sounds, while electronic pianos use electronic boards to produce sounds similar to those of acoustic pianos.

In the past, these genera were sometimes united in one family, Physeteridae, with two species of Kogia in the subfamily Kogiinae; however, the most recent practice is to allocate the genus Kogia to its own family, the Kogiidae, leaving the Physeteridae as a monotype family (a single extant species), although additional fossil representatives of both families are known. The sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus) is the largest toothed whale species, with the adult giant (male) growing to a length of about 15\u201318 m (49\u201359 ft), and weighing about 45\u201370 metric tons (length 44\u201369) tons; 50\u201377 short tons).

The eyes of the physeteroids cannot rotate in their sockets, and have only vestigial anterior space. Echolocation is likely a much more important tool for these animals than vision. Another common feature is the spermaceti, a semi-liquid waxy white substance that fills the 'case' or spermaceti organ in the whale's head, which plays a major role in the production and directional manipulation of the focused clicking sound used for echolocation in large extant sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus).

Members of both families eat squid, fish and even sharks. Pregnancy lasts from 9 to 15 months, depending on the species. Only offspring remain with the mother for at least two years, before weaning. The Physeteroids do not reach full sexual maturity for several years. All species gather in 'pods' or flocks, consisting mainly of females, calves, and juvenile males, although the size of these pods is usually smaller in the cogiids. The earliest known fossils of sperm whales are from the late Oligocene - about 25 million years ago, with ancestors traced back from the most recent Eocene before deviating from the rest of the odontoceti line, leading to dolphins, and porpoises (small-toothed whales). Fossil records show that sperm whales were more common in the Miocene period, where basalt lineages (such as Zygophyseter and Naganocetus) existed; other fossil genera assigned to the Physeteridae include Ferecetotherium, Helvicetus, Idiorophus, Diaphorocetus, Aulophyseter, Orycterocetus, Scaldicetus, and Placoziphius, while cogiid fossil genera include Kogiopsis, Scaphokogia, and Praekogia.

Christmas is celebrated in evening services on December 24; and a morning service on December 25. Some Orthodox churches celebrate Christmas on January 6 (see also Epiphany). In the western tradition, the commemoration of Christmas also contains non-religious aspects. Some of the Christmas traditions that originated in the West include Christmas trees, Christmas cards, exchanging gifts between friends, and family members as well as stories about Santa Klaus or Santa Claus. The word \"christmas\" was absorbed from Portuguese, i.e. christmas, derived from the Latin expression Dies Natalis (Birthday), a form of the verb n\u0101scor (n\u0101sceris, n\u0101sc\u012b, n\u0101tus sum).a] The word is also used in other Romance languages, such as natale (Italian), and nadal (Catalan). The word nadal in Spanish began to become obsolete and gradually the word navidad began to be used frequently to refer to christmas day. In the Bible Indonesian itself is not found the word \"Christmas\", there is only the birth of Jesus. The story of Jesus' birth in the New Testament Gospels is written in the books of Matthew (Matthew 1:18-2:23) and Luke (Luke 2:1-21). According to Luke, Mary knew from an angel that she had conceived from the Holy Spirit without copulation. After that she and her husband Joseph left their home in Nazareth to walk to the city of Bethlehem to register in the census ordered by August, the Roman Emperor at the time. Since they had nowhere to stay in the city, the baby Jesus was laid in a manger (malaf). The birth of Christ in Bethlehem Euphrates, Judea, in the hometown of David, Joseph's ancestor, fulfilled the prophecy of the prophet Micah (Micah 5:1-2).

Matthew records the genealogy and birth of Jesus from a virgin, and then turns to the arrival of wise men from the East\u2014presumably Arabia or Persia\u2014to see the newborn Jesus. The wise men first arrived in Jerusalem and reported to the king of Judea, Herod the Great, that they had seen a star\u2014now called the Star of Bethlehem\u2014welcoming the birth of a king. Further research led them to Judean Bethlehem and the home of Mary and Joseph. They offered gold, frankincense, and myrrh to the baby Jesus. While staying overnight, the wise men had a dream containing a warning that King Herod planned the murder of the child. Therefore they decided to go straight home without telling Herod the success of their mission. Matthew then reports that Jesus' family fled to Egypt to avoid the actions of King Herod who decided to kill all children under two in Bethlehem in order to eliminate rivals to his rule. After Herod's death, Jesus and his family returned from Egypt, but to avoid the new king of Judea (Herod the Great's son, Herod Arkhelaus) they went to Galilee and stayed in Nazareth. The other side of the story of Jesus' birth told by the Gospel of Luke is the delivery of the news by the angels to the shepherds. In the Gospel of Matthew it is recorded that there were Magi from the East coming to Judea because they saw a great star shining over the territory of Jerusalem. They followed the star all the way to the city of Bethlehem, the birthplace of Jesus. Some astronomers and historians have attempted to explain the combination of a number of traceable celestial events that may have shed light on the never-before-seen sighting of the giant star, the most powerful opinion being that of Johannes Kepler, who explained that the Christmas Star or Bethlehem Star is astronomically the conjunction of the planets Jupiter and Saturn in the Pisces constellation.

This term is used to accompany the statement that something will be done in the future. In countries that use Arabic, the term is used by all religious people, which means that this term does not indicate the nature of a particular religion, but only has the meaning of \"If Allah permits\". One of the uses of God willing is to indicate that the success achieved is not only due to one's hard work and will, but rather that the hard work made is to obtain rida from God. Where God's rida can be interpreted as the best thing for man, the earth, and all of God's other creations. The term is generally used by Muslims, but it is also often used by Christian groups in the middle east, such as the Orthodox Coptic Church. God willing, it is said when talking about plans or activities that are expected to occur in the future. The term also denotes an obedience to God, where one who speaks it means putting all decisions in God's hands, and accepting the fate that sometimes God acts inconsistently with human expectations.

They live to be 20 years old, and are born without horns. Bison is the largest land animal found only in America and Europe. In America, bison usually live in river valleys and also meadow plains as well as areas filled with dense shrubs because they are animals whose main food is grass and shrubs. Meanwhile, European bison mostly live in forests that are not too dense and on plains that are overgrown with shrubs. Bison are horned mammals that live in groups, but unlike other groups of animals, bison herds are usually grouped by sex and they will meet other groups when the breeding season has arrived. In the 1800s American bison was once declared almost extinct, due to its population continuing to decline drastically due to human poaching and also the clearing of land for settlements. Seeing this, some breeders took the initiative to start developing bison farms and not just catching wild bison until now the bison population can get out of the abyss of extinction even though some bison species remain unsaved. Bison cultivation is most widely carried out on the American continent, but its development is quite slow. Ted Turner was one of the pioneering bison breeders in the United States with limited success; In the 1990s he built a specialty restaurant selling Bison steak.

Bagus Burhan's father is a descendant of the Pajang Sultanate while his mother is a descendant of the Demak Sultanate. Bagus Burhan was taken care of by Ki Tanujaya, a servant of his father. As a young man Burhan was notoriously mischievous and fond of gambling. He was sent by his grandfather to study Islam with Kyai Imam Besari, the leader of Pesantren Gebang Tinatar in Tegalsari village (Ponorogo). At first he was still wayward, even fleeing to Madiun. After returning to Ponorogo, it is said, he had an \"epiphany\" in the Kedungwatu River, thus turning into an alim young man who was good at preaching. When he returned to Surakarta, Burhan was taken as the adopted grandson of Panembahan Buminoto (Pakubuwana IV's younger brother). He was then appointed Carik Kadipaten Anom entitled Mas Pajanganom on October 28, 1819. During the reign of Pakubuwana V (1820 \u2013 1823), Burhan's career faltered because the new king did not like Panembahan Buminoto who always urged him to raise the rank of Burhan. On November 9, 1821 Burhan married Raden Ayu Gombak and joined his in-laws, namely the Duke of Cakradiningrat in Kediri. There he felt saturated and decided to travel accompanied by Ki Tanujoyo.

He is also known as an accomplished astrologer with a wide variety of supernatural sciences. Chronicle texts tend to be symbolic in describing the speciality of Ranggawarsita. For example, he is said to understand the language of animals. This is a symbol that, Ranggawarsita is sensitive to the grievances of small people. Pakubuwana IX ascended the throne in 1861. He was the son of Pakubuwana VI who was banished to Ambon in 1830 for supporting Prince Diponegoro. It is said that before arresting Pakubuwana VI, the Dutch first arrested the palace clerk, namely Mas Pajangswara for testimony. Despite being tortured to death, Pajangswara remained silent unwilling to divulge Pakubuwana VI's relationship with Prince Dipanegara. Despite this, the Dutch still disposed of Pakubuwana VI on the grounds that Pajangswara had leaked everything. It was this slander that caused Pakubuwana IX to dislike Ranggawarsita, who was none other than Pajangswara's son. Ranggawarsita's relations with the Dutch were also not good. Although he had a friend and student of an Indo named C.F. Winter, Sr., his movements were still supervised by the Dutch.

Paleobiology is not the same as geobiology, which focuses more on the interaction between the biosphere and the physical Earth. Paleobiology research uses biological field research from current biota and millions of years old fossils to answer questions about molecular evolution and the evolutionary history of life. In this scientific search, macro fossils, micro fossils, and trace fossils are usually analyzed. However, biochemical analysis of DNA and RNA samples of the 21st century provides much progress, as does the biometric construction of phylogenetic trees. Researchers in this field are known as paleobiologists. The founder or \"father\" of modern paleobiology was Baron Franz Nopcsa (1877 to 1933), a Hungarian scientist educated at the University of Vienna. He originally called this the discipline \"paleophysiology.\" However, the person worthy of recognition in coining the word paleobiology itself should be given to Professor Charles Schuchert. He proposed the term in 1904 to begin a \"broad new science\" that merged with \"traditional paleontology with evidence and insights of isotope geology and chemistry.\" On the other hand, Charles Doolittle Walcott, a Smithsonian adventurer, has been called the \"founder of Pracambrium paleobiology.\" Although best known as the discoverer of the mid-Cambrian Burgess shale animal fossil, in 1883 this American curator discovered \"the first Pracambrian-era fossil cell known to science\" \u2013 a stromatolite reef that became known as the Cryptozoon algae. In 1899 he discovered the first acritarch fossil cell, a Precambrian-era algal phytoplankton which he named Chuaria. Finally, in 1914, Walcott reported findings of \"small cells and cell-like body chains\" belonging to the purple bacteria of the Pracambrian era. Later 20th-century paleobiologists also discovered clearly archaean and proterozoic eon microfossils: In 1954, the findings of Stanley A. Tyler and Elso S.

The Hashmonayim dynasty was founded under the leadership of Simon Makabe, two decades after his brother Judas Maccabees (\"The Hammer\") defeated the forces of the Seleucid Empire through a Maccabee rebellion in 165 BC. The Hashmonayim kingdom lasted for 103 years before surrendering to Herod's Dynasty in 37 BC. Even then, Herod the Great felt obliged to increase the legitimacy of his reign by marrying a Hashmonayim daughter, Mariamne, and conspiring to drown the last Hashmonayim male heir at his Jericho's court. Based on historical sources including the books 1 Maccabees and 2 Maccabees as well as the first book of the Jewish War by the Roman-Jewish historian Josephus (37\u2013c. 100 AD), the Hashmonayim Kingdom rose after a successful revolt launched by the Jews against the Seleucid king Antiochus IV. After Antiochus' successful invasion of Egypt Ptolemy was repulsed by the Roman Republic, he moved to assert strict control over Israel, invade Jerusalem and its Temple, and suppress Jewish worship. The Maccabees revolt (167 BC) began a 25-year period of Jewish independence that could have occurred thanks to the fall of the Seleucid Empire, which was invaded by the Roman Republic and the Parthian Empire. But the power vacuum that allowed the Jewish state to be recognized by the Roman Senate (c. 139 BC) was ultimately exploited by the Romans themselves. Hirkanus II and Aristobulus II, great-grandsons of Simon, became pawns in the proxy war between Julius Caesar and Pompeius the Great as a result of which the kingdom came under the supervision of the Roman governor of Syria (64 BC). The death of Pompeius (48 BC), Caesar (44 BC), and the Roman civil war released Israel from Roman clutches, thus allowing the revival of the Hashmonayim supported by the Parthian Empire.

This word is usually used in the context of derogation. For example, if an official appoints or raises the position of a relative/family instead of someone more qualified and not a relative, the manager will be guilty of nepotism. Biologists have hinted that the tendency towards nepotism is based on instinct, as a form of sibling selection. The word nepotism comes from the Latin word nepos, which means \"nephew\" or \"grandson\". In the Middle Ages some Catholic popes and bishops- who had taken the promise of \"chastity\", so usually had no biological children - gave a special position to his nephew as if to his own child. Some whales are known to appoint nephews and other brothers to cardinals. Often, such appointments were used to continue the papal \"dynasty\". For example, Pope Callistus III, of the Borja family, appointed two of his nephews cardinals; one of them, Rodrigo, later used his cardinal position as a springboard to the position of pope, becoming Pope Alexander VI.Incidentally, Alexander appointed Alessandro Farnese, the younger brother of his dark lover, to cardinal; Farnese later became Pope Paul III. Paul also committed nepotism, by appointing two of his nephews (ages 14 and 16) as Cardinals. Such a practice was finally ended by Pope Innocent XII who issued the papal bulla Romanum decet pontificem in 1692. This papal bull forbade all popes throughout the ages to bequeath property, office, or income to relatives, with the exception that a most qualified brother could be made a Cardinal.

Basketball can be on an open court, although professional matches are generally conducted in enclosed spaces. The required field of play is also relatively not large, for example compared to football. In addition, basketball games are also more competitive because the tempo of the game tends to be faster when compared to other football sports, such as volleyball and football. Basketball is one of the most popular sports by residents of the United States and residents in other parts of the world, including in South America, Southern Europe, Lithuania, and also in Indonesia. Many basketball competitions are held every year, such as the British Basketball League (BBL) in the UK, the National Basketball Association (NBA) in America, and the Indonesia Basketball League (IBL) in Indonesia.

Unlike the modern basketball baskets, the baskets used at that time did not have holes, so the incoming balls had to be removed manually. Of course, this method is inefficient, so the bottom of the basket is hollowed out so that the ball can come out. The first official game was played at the YMCA gymnasium in Albany, New York, on January 20, 1892, with nine players. The game finished with a score of 1\u20130; and played on a field half the size of an NBA field. Frank Mahan, one of the players of the first game, approached Naismith, in early 1892, with the intention of asking Naismith the name of his new game. Naismith replied that he hadn't thought about it because he was focused on starting the game. Mahan suggested the name \"Naismith ball\", in which Naismith laughed, saying such a name would kill the game of a game. Mahan then said, \"Why not basketball?\" Naismith replied, \"we've got a basket (of basketball) and a ball, that would be a good name.\" At the beginning, each team was nine people and there were no dribbles, so the ball could only move through the pitch. The history of basketball rules begins with 13 basic rules written by James Naismith himself.

Sparta was founded by the Dorians who defeated Laconia and Messenia who in their development became very powerful and powerful. In the 7th century BC, Sparta was a literary center but after 600 BC military science was more highlighted. The children of the ruling class (Spartiate) were trained into the military. Under the military class were the perioeci (artisans and merchants) and helots (slaves). Only the Spartiates had legal rights and civil rights. The Prehistoric Period of Sparta is difficult to reconstruct, as there is not much written evidence from that period and it is also distorted by oral traditions. However, the earliest evidence regarding human settlement in the Sparta region is from pottery dating from the mid-Neolithic period, found in the vicinity of Kouphovouno, about two kilometers south-southwest of Sparta . These are the earliest traces of the Sparta Mikene civilization, as depicted in Homer's Illiad. This civilization seems to have fallen into decline at the end of the bronze age. According to Herodotus, the Macedonian tribes from the north moved to Peloponesia, where they were called the Dorians, they conquered the local tribes and settled there. The Dorians seem to have begun to develop the territorial boundaries of Sparta almost before they established their own state. Sparta fought against Doria Argive in the east and southeast, and also Arkadia Achaea in the northwest. Evidence suggests that the Sparta area is relatively inaccessible due to the topography of the Taygete plain so Sparta was indeed safe from the start. According to Herodotus and Thucydides, between the 8th and 7th centuries BC Sparta experienced a period of lawlessness and civil strife. As a result, they carried out a series of political and social reforms in society that they later attributed to their lawgiver, Lykourgos These changes marked the beginning of the classical history of Sparta.

When he is ignored by Zeus, Nemesis states that Themis is very angry. But Themis is not like that. This beautiful-banded Titan was even the first to offer a cup to Hera when she returned to Olympian Themis was one of the goddesses who had a connection with the Delphi Oracle because she helped build it. He received it from his mother, Gaia and gave it to Foibe. Many Neo-Pagans especially Neo-Pagan Hellenists consider Themis to be the goddess of benevolence and justice. many modern sects consider Themis to have played a role in determining life after death. He carries a set of scales that are used to weigh a person's good and bad. Themis also gives the final input before the fate of the soul is determined by Hades. Pagans usually prayed, burned oil and frankincense, food, or spilled drinks as offerings to themis. They considered Themis promising health, pleasure, masculinity, and charisma to his followers. Themis are usually worshipped by men. The only spouse of Themis is Zeus. From her relationship with Zeus, Themis gave birth to Horai (the goddesses of order) and Moirai (the goddesses of destiny). While According to Pindar, Moirai already existed when Themis and Zeus were married. The personification of the abstract concept is characteristic of the Greeks. The ability of the goddess Themis to see the future makes her one of the Oracles in Delphi, which ultimately makes her the goddess of justice.

Affection is caused by social interaction between individuals by involving feelings that are in the heart. Affection is not visible to the eye, but it can be felt by humans directly. The basic principle of affection is the feeling of being liked and loved. This need is the need to get a warm response or treatment from others, especially from parents, teachers or friends who are in the same environment. There are three types of affection responses namely mood, emotions and certain feelings. Such affection responses manifest in high and low intensity of physiological motion with feelings of weakness or strength. Each person has differences in the intensity of affection or how strongly they perceive their emotions. The intensity of affection is individual differences related to the strength of his emotional experience. Intense people affectively experience both positive and negative emotions deeply, where when they feel sad, they are really sad, and when they are happy, they are really happy.

In a matter of days, the level of positive affection tends to peak at the end of the morning, which is around 10:00 to noon, and then stays at that level until the beginning of the night, which is around 19:00. About 12 hours after waking up, positive affection begins to fall until midnight, and then rises again after sunrise. Negative affection is an unpleasant affection. Objects can give rise to a wide variety of attitudes, can give rise to various levels of affection in a person. Common states of subjective stress and unpleasant conditions include anger, humiliation and nervousness. Negative affection occurs due to poor coping stress towards work events related to various types of work-related results. People who express high negative affections view themselves and different aspects of the world around them as generally negative.

Developed and named after the leader of the Russian Revolution, Vladimir Lenin (1870\u20131924), it consisted of socialist political and economic theories developed from Marxism and Lenin's personal interpretation of Marxist theory that suited the social conditions of agrarian society in the Russian Empire (1721\u20131917). In the practice of revolution, Leninism reverses the order of Marxist philosophy of economics over politics so as to allow a political revolution led by a revolutionary vanguard party rather than having to wait for a spontaneous urban working-class revolution to occur as expressed in Marxism. Post-October Revolution of 1917, Leninism was the dominant variant of Marxism which subsequently became the official ideology of Soviet democracy (through workers' councils) in the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic before merging into the Soviet Union in 1922. As a political science term, Leninism came into general use in 1922, just moments after Lenin had a stroke that made him no longer actively participate in the Russian Communist Party. Two years later, precisely at the V Comintern Congress, July 1924, Grigory Zinoviev popularized the use of the term Leninism. In the aftermath of Lenin's death, Josef Stalin and Leon Trotsky fought ideological wars within the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In 1924, Stalin proposed the thesis of Socialism in One Country, namely that the Soviet Union should establish socialism within the country while supporting revolutionary governments in all parts of the world. Trotsky considered that socialism in one country was impossible to implement and the USSR was supposed to support the occurrence of revolutions in developed countries. Stalin and his supporters referred to Trotsky's argument as Trotskyism to emphasize that Socialism in One Country was a theoretical continuation of Leninism.

The platypus is the only living representative or monotypic taxon of its family (Ornithorhynchidae) and genus (Ornithorhynchus), although a number of species related to it also appear in the fossil record. Along with four species of echidna, the platypus is one of five extant species of monotremata, which are mammals that lay eggs instead of giving birth to offspring. Like other monotreme, it senses prey through electrolocation. The platypus is one of the few species of venomous mammals, in which the male platypus has spurs behind its legs capable of conducting can, which can cause severe pain in humans. The unusual appearance of this egg-laying mammal, which has a duck-like beak, a biwara-like tail, and beaver-like legs puzzled European naturalists when they first discovered it, and the first scientists who examined the body of the preserved platypus (in 1799) judged it to be fake, saying it was made of several animals sewn together. The unique features of the platypus make it an important subject in the study of evolutionary biology, and an iconic symbol of Australia that is easily recognizable. The platypus is culturally significant to some Aboriginal Australians, who used to hunt these animals for food. The platypus appears as a mascot at national events and is displayed on the back of the Australian twenty-cent coin, the platypus is also the animal emblem of the state of New South Wales.

When the platypus was first discovered by Europeans in 1798, skins and sketches from it were sent back to England by Captain John Hunter, the second Governor of New South Wales. The initial guess of British scientists was that the attributes were a lie. George Shaw, who made the first description of this animal in Naturalist's Miscellany in 1799, stated that it was impossible not to doubt its authenticity, and Robert Knox believed that this animal was likely made by an Asian taxidermist. Initially it was thought that a person had sewn a duck's beak into the body of a biwara-like animal. Shaw even took scissors onto his dry skin to check for stitches.

Stalinist industrialization was officially designed to accelerate development towards communism, emphasizing that such rapid industrialization was necessary because the country was previously economically backward compared to other countries; and that it is necessary to face the challenges posed by the internal and external enemies of communism. Rapid industrialization was accompanied by mass collectivization of agriculture and rapid urbanization. Rapid urbanization converted many small villages to industrial towns. To accelerate the development of industrialization, Stalin pragmatically concluded cooperation contracts with large private companies of America, such as the Ford Motor Company, which under state supervision helped in developing the industrial basis of the Soviet economy from the 1920s to the 1930s.

The term is derived from the Latin, conserv\u0101re, preserve; \"keeping, maintaining, practicing\". Because different cultures have established and different values, conservatives in different cultures have different goals. Some conservatives are trying to preserve the status quo, while others are trying to return to the values of the past, the status quo ante. Samuel Francis defined authentic conservatism as \"the enduring and strengthening of certain people and their institutionalized cultural expressions.\" Roger Scruton called it \"the preservation of social ecology\" and \"the politics of procrastination, whose goal is to maintain, for as long as possible, existence as the life and health of a social organism.\" Conservatism has never been, and never intended to publish systematic rises such as Thomas Hobbes's Leviathan or Locke's Two Risalates on Government. As a result, what it means to be a conservative today is often the subject of debate and a topic obscured by associations with a wide variety of ideologies or political parties (and often opposites). R.J. White once put it this way: \"Putting conservatism in a bottle with a label is like trying to turn the atmosphere into a liquid ... The difficulty arises from the nature of conservatism itself. Because conservatism is more of a habit of thought, a way of feeling, a way of life, than a political doctrine.\" Although conservatism was a political thought, from the very beginning, it contained many plots that could later be labeled conservative, only during the Time of Reasoning, and in particular the reaction to the events surrounding the French Revolution in 1789, that conservatism began to emerge as a distinctive attitude or train of thought.

The Anglo-Irish statesman Edmund Burke, who steadfastly put forward arguments against the French Revolution, also sympathized with some of the goals of the American Revolution. This classical conservative tradition often emphasizes that conservatism has no ideology, in the sense of a utopian program, of a form of general design. Burke developed these ideas in reaction to the 'enlightened' idea of a society led by abstract reason. Although he did not use the term, he anticipated criticism of modernism, a term first used in the late 19th century by the Dutch religious conservative Abraham Kuyper. Burke was troubled by the Enlightenment, and instead advocated the value of tradition. Some people, Burke said, don't have enough reason than others, and so some of them will create a worse government than others if they really rely on reason. For Burke, the proper formulation of government is not derived from abstractions such as \"Reason,\" but rather from the development of the state according to what the times value and other important institutions of society such as the family and the Church. Although nominally Conservative, Disraeli sympathized with some of the demands of the Chartis and defended the alliance between the landed nobility and the working class in the face of rising middle-class forces. He helped form the Young English group in 1842 to promote the view that the rich should use their power to protect the poor from exploitation by the middle class.

These verses tell of their lineage. In this game Sangguana which became the focus of attention because she had artistic talent, unwittingly the king's daughter fell in love with Sangguana and met the king's daughter, Sangguana was asked to create an instrument that had never existed. If successful, it is entitled to edit the king's daughter. One night Sangguana dreamed of playing one beautiful musical instrument in its shape and voice. ", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "Then Sangguana succeeded in creating this musical instrument named Sandu (meaning the one who dares to vibrate). The king's daughter named this instrument after her language sya, namely hitu (seven), because the instrument has seven strings and the song played is named depo hitu which means once played the seven strings vibrate. These strings are made from the roots of banyan trees and then replaced with dried animal intestines. The second version of folklore begins with the story of two friends, namely Lunggi Lain and Blok Ama Sina. These two friends worked daily as sheep shepherds and tappers. The idea of making a sasando musical instrument when they are making haik (tuak water reservoir) made of ejected leaves between the fingers of the elontar leaf there is a kind of thread (rote fifik language) accidentally fific or the thread is tightened and then plucked makes a different sound, but this thread or fifik is easy to break. The beginning of this incident prompted Lunggi Lain and Blok Ama Sina to develop it, they wanted a musical instrument that could imitate the notes on the gong. Finally, it succeeded in creating sounds or notes on the gong, namely by gouging the bones from the lontar leaf sheet which was then held with a log. Because the notes produced are always changing and the sound is very small, then the lontar leaf sheets are replaced with bamboo, namely by gouging out the bamboo skin as much as the notes on the gong which are then held with wooden bars. This idea continued and then the strings were replaced from the fibers of the lontar leaf and the resonance chamber from the haik. The shape of the sasando is very unique and different from other stringed musical instruments. The main part is in the form of a bamboo tube 7 to 80 cm long.

The students are located in a complex that also provides a mosque for worship, a space for study, and other religious activities. This complex is usually surrounded by walls to be able to monitor the entry and exit of the students in accordance with applicable regulations. Pesantren can also be understood as an institution of religious education and teaching, generally in a nonclassical way, where a kyai teaches Islamic religious knowledge to students based on books written in Arabic by medieval clerics, and the students usually live in huts (dormitories) in the pesantren. The rise of cases of obscenity and violence within the pesantren environment, such as the case of Herry Wirawan, a pesantren teacher who raped dozens of his female students and caused nine of them to become pregnant and give birth, has triggered a number of criticisms of this religious educational institution. LPAI, represented by Seto Mulyadi, proposed a review of the learning system in pesantren which seemed exclusive and closed. Meanwhile, Muhammadiyah requested that the supervision and guidance of pesantren be further improved. Homosexuality is also known to have sprung up in islamic boarding schools that separate men and women.

Generally, a boarding school starts from the presence of a kyai somewhere, then a student who wants to learn religion comes to him. After more and more students came, the initiative arose to set up a cottage or dormitory next to the kiai house. In ancient times kiai did not plan how to build his cottage, but all that occurred to mind was how to teach religious knowledge so that it could be understood and understood by students. Kiai at that time had not paid attention to the places inhabited by the students, which were generally very small and simple. They occupy a small building or house that they set up themselves around the kiai house. The greater the number of students, the more huts that are established. The students then popularized the existence of the islamic boarding school, so that it became famous everywhere, for example, as in the cottages that arose during the Wali Songo era. Islamic boarding schools in Indonesia have a very large role, both for the progress of Islam itself and for the Indonesian nation as a whole. Based on existing records, religious education activities in the archipelago have been started since 1596. This religious activity became known as the islamic boarding school.

Poseidon has a weapon in the form of a trident that can cause floods and earthquakes. The trident was made by the Cyclops during Titanomakhia. Poseidon also has vehicles towed by hippokampos (half-horse, half-fish creatures). Poseidon is an Amphitrite and has a child named Triton. Poseidon is also the god who created the horse in his attempt to seduce Demeter. The sea god Nethuns in Etruscan mythology was adopted into Roman mythology as Neptune: both were equivalent gods to Poseidon. Poseidon had been revered in Pylos and Thebes since the Greek bronze age as the brother of Zeus and Hades. There is a Homeros Hymn to Poseidon. Poseidon had many children. Poseidon was a protector of many cities in Greece, although he failed to obtain the City of Athens. His favorite animals are horses and bulls. Pine trees were sacred to him. God of the SeaThe Underworld God List of Greek mythological figures Poseidon's name is clearly rooted in Greek i.e. p\u00f3sis \"king, husband\" with the element -don, possibly from dea, \"goddess\". According to the Linear B clay sheet, the name PO-SE-DA-WO-NE (\"Poseidon\") appears more often than DI-U-JA (\"Zeus\"). Her feminine form, PO-SE-DE-IA, was also discovered, suggesting the presence of another goddess who became Poseidon's partner and was likely a precursor to Amfitrit. Clay sheets from Pylos tell of the offering of objects to \"Poseidon and the Two Queens\". The clearest identification of the \"Two Queens\" is Demeter and Persefon, or their predecessors, goddesses who were not associated with Poseidon in later periods.

Poseidon has always been described as a mighty man, bearded and carrying a trident. One punch from his trident can split the earth. Poseidon is sometimes depicted as half-bodied fish. He drove a carriage pulled by two hippocmmos. Poseidon is often depicted with his entourage of Amfitrit, Triton, Nereid, dolphins, Dioskuri, Palaemon, Pegasus, Bellerofontes, Thalassa, Ino, and Galene. Poseidon is often depicted with sea shells or other marine animals. In Hesiod's Theogonia, Poseidon is referred to as the \"Dark-Haired One\". Like most sea gods, he has the ability to change his form, but Poseidon has no fortune-telling power. Poseidon's figure does not characterize the character of grandeur like his brother Zeus; But it better reflects the characteristics of an ocean that can be capricious, sometimes turbulent and sometimes calm. In Roman mythology Poseidon was known as Neptune. He is also known by nicknames as follows:Aigaios, Asfaleios, Kuirios, Damatites, Epaktaios, Epopsios, Gaiaokhos, Genethlios, Helikonios, Hippios, Hippokurios, Isthmos, Lekhaios, Onkhestios, Patros, Petraios, Samikos, Samios, Tainarius.

Clairtics is considered a development of phenetics, a way of quantitative grouping in biological systematics based on morphological similarities. Somewhat different from phenetics, cladistics bases itself on evolutionary and molecular features. This science is widely used in phylogeny. When applied in phylogeny, the similarity of molecular traits quantified and supported by cladistic output is given an evolutionary interpretation. Therefore, in cladistics the grouping is always directed at the formation of a complete clade (including all the components included in it). Because of its more universal nature, cladistics is now used in other fields as well, such as literature and linguistics. An example of application in literature is its use in the grouping of various versions of the Canterbury Tales manuscript. In historical linguistics, cladistics is used to regroup Austronesian languages. The output of a branched cladistics is a cladogram, a type of diagram that is thought to represent kinship relationships among grouped organisms. The kladogram has much in common with the evolutionary tree. Cladograms are created by utilizing hundreds of thousands to millions of genetic information, both in the form of markers and sequences of DNA and RNA. Klad is the main study in cladistics. There are three situations in the grouping by cladistics: monophylly (from monophyly; the adjective form is monophyletic, from monophyletic; the synonyms are holophily), paraphily, and polyphylly (from polyphyly). A grouping using cladistics must produce a complete clade, called monophyletic. This principle is used in modern plant classification, which for flowering plants has resulted in an APG III (and APG II) classification system that is widely accepted among botanists.

Since an object has many aspects, it is difficult to cover the whole aspect (trying to cover the whole truth of the object) The question of truth, much debated by theologians, philosophers, and logicians. One simple way to study a subject is to determine everything that can be right or wrong, including statements, propositions, beliefs, sentences, and thoughts. True is basically the conformity between thought and reality. The proposition of a rock lighter than a kapuk is a false proposition, on the contrary the proposition of the earth moving around the sun is the correct proposition. The determination of right and wrong for the proposition is based on its conformity to actual reality. The second measure of truth is the absence of opposition in him. A proposition is declared true if there is no opposition from beginning to end. The proposition that falls into this principle is, \"he is an honest man who likes to deceive\". Opposition is also found in statements that cannot be grasped, such as the statement \"God can make a rock greater than Himself\". The statement is an example of a false statement because it does not present a definite intent. While the term validity comes from the word validus (Latin) which means strong, valid in relation to logic means valid, strong, or valid is used in the sense of determining the validity or not of a proposition.

Truth and error are part of an individual's proposition or statement whereas validity and invalidity are part of an argument. The relationship between a true or false proposition and a valid argument or not is very important and complicated. An argument may be valid even if one of its premises is incorrect. Each argument has a relationship between its premises and its conclusions, this relationship can be maintained as a valid argument even if its correctness is disputed. There are many combinations of possible premises and conclusions of right or wrong in a valid argument or not. In knowledge, truth is divided into two kinds, namely absolute or absolute truth, eternal truth that is not capricious and not influenced by other factors and nisbi truth, truth that changes and is influenced by other factors. Absolute truth is derived from revelation while truth derived from ratio is called rationalism truth and which is derived from the senses produces empirical truth. The truth of science is measured by ratios and empirical evidence. If the theory of science is rational and there is empirical evidence of it, then the theory is correct. The measure of the truth of philosophical knowledge is logical. If the theory of philosophy is logical, then the theory is correct.

His consort, Kusumawardhani was the daughter of Hayam Wuruk who was born to Sri Sudewi also called Paduka sori. In Nagarakretagama (written 1365), Kusumawardhani and Wikramawardhana are reported to be married. Even though at that time Hayam Wuruk was only 31 years old. So, it is certain that the two cousins have been matched since childhood. From that marriage, a crown prince named Rajasakusuma entitled Hyang Wekasing Sukha was born, who died before he could become king. Pararaton also mentioned that Wikramawardhana had three children from concubines, namely Bhre Tumapel, Suhita, and Kertawijaya. Bhre Tumapel was born to Bhre Mataram daughter of Bhre Pandansalas. He succeeded Rajasakusuma as crown prince, but also died before he could become king. The position as heir to the throne of Majapahit was then held by Suhita who was born to Bhre Daha, the daughter of Bhre Wirabhumi. When Nagarakretagama was written in 1365, Kusumawardhani was still the crown princess who served as Bhre Kabalan. Meanwhile, Wikramawardhana served as Bhre Mataram and handled civil matters. According to Pararaton, after Hayam Wuruk's death in 1389, Kusumawardhani and Wikramawardhana ascended the throne and ruled side by side.

So, Wikramawardhana married her own niece as a concubine. Rajasakusuma the crown prince is thought to have inherited the post of Bhre Kabalan in place of Kusumawardhani, although it is not expressly mentioned in Pararaton. In 1398, Majapahit sent its fleet to attack Iskandar Shah (king of the Kingdom of Singapore). This was due to Iskandar Shah's accusation of one of his concubines committing adultery. As punishment, the king stripped the concubine publicly. To avenge her, the concubine's father, Sang Rajuna Tapa who was also an official at the Iskandar Shah court, secretly sent a message to Wikramawardhana of Majapahit, to attack Singapore. In 1398 Rajasakusuma appointed Gajah Menguri as patih to replace Gajah Enggon who died. This news in Pararaton should be interpreted as \"proposing\", not \"inaugurating\". In 1399, Rajasakusuma died before becoming king. His tomb temple is called Paramasuka Pura in Tanjung. The position of crown prince was then held by Bhre Tumapel son of Wikramawardhana of Bhre Mataram. In 1400 Wikramawardhana abdicated to live as a priest. Kusumawardhani also ruled Majapahit fully. According to Pararaton, Wikramawardhana again became king, because Kusumawardhani died. Kusumawardhani was enshrined in Pabangan, named Laksmipura. In 1401, Wikramawardhana fell out with Bhre Wirabhumi, Kusumawardhani's half-brother. The dispute between the rulers of Western Majapahit and Eastern Majapahit culminated into a civil war in 1404, called Paregreg or Regreg War. In 1398, Majapahit sent its fleet to attack Iskandar Shah (king of the Kingdom of Singapore), consisting of three hundred main warships and hundreds of small ships, carrying no less than 200,000 people.

The hardener was an early form of rifle used for soldiers and defensive uses. The drain in the form of a gun is called the term Terakul (English: Dragon), from this the term dragun is formed. \"Muras\" in Indonesian (based on KBBI III) means a sundut cannon. The original term pemuras, i.e. blunderbuss comes from the Dutch word donderbus, i.e. a combination of donder (\"Halilintar\") and bus (\"pipe\") (Middle Dutch: busse, box, tiub, from Late Latin, buxis, box). The change from donder to blunder is believed by some to be intentional; The term blunder at its origin was used in transitive form, synonymous with \"to confuse\", and it is believed to describe the powerful sound of a short barrel and a large muzzle of the drainer. The term dragon is taken from the carved decoration in the shape of the head of a dragon legend animal around the snout in the early version of the drain; The pop of the muzzle will then give a picture of the dragon's fire breath. The hardener was an early form of a broken rifle, and was used in the same use and role. Many untrue myths often tell that the drainer is filled with pieces of stone or iron, this will damage the barrel of the rifle. The drain is usually filled with a number of small lead balls that are smaller than the diameter of the barrel hole. The barrel can be made of iron or copper. Its inflated muzzle is not intended to increase the spread of the shot but rather makes it easier to fill gunpowder and lead balls into rifles. The muzzle of the flower is a characteristic of the Droozer, distinguishing it from large-caliber carbines; the difference between a drainer and a musket is less obvious, as the muskets also use lead balls, and some have an expanding barrel. ", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "The drain is usually very short, with a barrel of less than two feet (60 cm), while the barrel of a musket gun usually exceeds three legs (90 cm). One source writes a comparison of weapons in the early to mid-17th century, the barrel of the wheel button was about 11 inches (28 cm) long, compared to 16 inches (41 cm) of the length of the barrel of the Drainer. In the archipelago, pemuras are thought to have come around the middle of the 17th century after being brought by the Dutch. Drainers are used for melee attacks. The bullets used are scattershots. The bullets can be lead, nails and metal chips. Drains and especially short-sighted were given to soldiers such as hussars, who required a light, easy-to-use rifle. Terakul was associated with hussars and the term dragun became synonymous with hussar infantry soldiers. In addition to cavalry, drains are also used in terrain where rifle-like characteristics are needed, such as the guarding of prisoners, the defense of mail chariots from robbers, and their usefulness in urban combat have also been recognized. The drainer used in the British Mail Service in the period 1788 - 1816 was a type of \"flintlock\" with a 14-inch copper barrel, copper trigger guard, iron trigger and iron safety. British mail trains usually had a worker escorting mail from street robbers, armed with a drain and a pair of pistols. One 18th-century chariot in the British collection had a 17-inch-long copper barrel and expanded to 2 inches at the muzzle of the barrel; This drainer is also equipped with a spring bayonet that is held along the barrel with a handle, and will come out forward when released. Although drainers are often associated with pilgrims the evidence suggests that drainers were rather rarely found in the American colonies.

Originally a card company that later grew from a toy company to a video game company, Nintendo was one of the largest video game companies in the world by market capitalization, creating several well-known and best-selling game franchises of all time, such as Mario, The Legend of Zelda, Animal Crossing, and Pok\u00e9mon. Founded on September 23, 1889 by Fusajiro Yamauchi, the company initially produced hanafuda handmade cards. By 1963, the company had tried several small niche businesses, such as taxi services and love hotels. Abandoning its former venture for toys in the 1960s, Nintendo developed into a video game company in the 1970s. Plus since the 1980s from major divisions such as Nintendo of America and Nintendo of Europe, it eventually became one of the most influential industries and the most valuable companies in Japan with a market amount of $37 billion in 2018. Nintendo was founded as a playing card company by Fujisaro Yamauchi on September 23, 1889. Headquartered in Kyoto, the company produces and markets hanafuda cards. The handmade cards later became popular, and Yamauchi provided assistant workers with mass production of cards to meet demand. The company was formally formed with an infinity partnership titled Yamauchi Nintendo & Co. Ltd. in 1933. The name changed to Nintendo Playing Card Co. Ltd. in 1951. Nintendo went on to manufacture playing cards in Japan and organized its own contact bridge tournament as the \"Nintendo Cup\".

It has found that the world's largest card game company has only a small office. Yamauchi's realization that the card game business only has such potential was a turning point. He then asked for permission to use Disney characters on card games to encourage sales. In 1963, Yamauche changed the name of Nintendo Playing Card Co. Ltd. to Nintendo Co., Ltd. The company then began experiments in other areas of the business using newly injected capital over a period of time between 1963 and 1968. Nintendo founded a taxi company called Daiya. The company initially succeeded. However, Nintendo was forced to sell it due to problems with the labor guild that made it expensive to run the service. Nintendo also founded a chain of love hotels, a TV chain, a food company (selling instant rice) and several other companies. All these companies then failed, and after the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, sales of card games declined, and Nintendo's stock plummeted to a record low of \u00a560. In 1966, Nintendo turned into the Japanese toy industry with the Ultra Hand, a hand that maintenance engineer Gunpei Yokoi could extend at his free time. Yoko was transferred from a maintenance person to a product developer of the \"Nintendo Games\" department. Nintendo went on to create popular toys, such as Ultra Machine, Love Tester and the light gun game series Kousenjuu.citation needed] Despite the successful product, Nintendo struggled to meet developers and manufacture the rapid turnaround needed in the toy market, and was far behind established companies like Bandai and Tomy.

These white blood cells serve to help the body fight various infectious diseases as part of the immune system. White blood cells are colorless, have nuclei, can move ameboidly, and can penetrate capillary/diapedesis walls. Under normal circumstances it contains 4x109 to 11x109 white blood cells inside a liter of blood of a healthy adult human - about 7,000-25,000 cells per drop. In every cubic millimeter of blood there are 6,000 to 10,000 (average 8,000) white blood cells. In case of leukemia, the number can increase to 50,000 cells per drop. In the body, leukocytes are not strictly related to a particular organ or tissue, they work independently like a single-celled organism. Leukocytes are able to move freely and interact and capture cellular flakes, foreign particles, or intruding microorganisms. In addition, leukocytes cannot divide themselves or reproduce in their own way, but rather they are the product of pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells present in the bone marrow. Leukocyte derivatives include: NK cells, mastocytes, eosinophils, basophils, and phagocytes including macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells. There are several types of white blood cells called granulocytes or polymorphonuclear cells, namely: There are two other types without granules in the cytoplasm called agranulocytes: Granulocytes and monocytes have an important role in protecting the body against microorganisms with their ability as phagocytes; They feed on live bacteria that enter the circulatory system. Observation through a microscope, it can be found that as many as 10-20 microorganisms are ingested by a grain of granulocytes.

Calcitonin acts to reduce blood calcium (Ca2+), defying the effects of parathyroid hormone (PTH). This hormone inhibits the degradation of bones by osteoclasts (cells that destroy the extracellular matrix) and stimulates the absorption of calcium and phosphates by bones. Calcitonin has been found in fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Calcitonin is a polypeptide hormone of 32 amino acids, with a molecular weight of 3454,93 daltons. Its structure consists of a single alpha helix. Alternative splicing of the calcitonin gene produces a peptide linked to 37 amino acids, called calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a type of beta. The following is a sequence of amino acids from human salmon and calcitonin. Calcitonin is formed by proteolytic cleavage of larger prepropeptides, which are products of the CALC1 gene. The CALC1 gene belongs to the superfamily of hormone-related hormone precursors including amyloid islet precursor proteins, calcitonin gene-related peptides (CGRP), and adrenomedulin precursors. Calcitonin secretion is stimulated by: The hormone participates in the metabolism of calcium (Ca2+) and phosphorus. In many ways, calcitonin fights parathyroid hormone (PTH). More specifically, calcitonin lowers blood Ca2+) levels in two ways: High concentrations of calcitonin may be able to increase the excretion of calcium and phosphate, through action on the renal tubules. However, this is a small effect with no physiological significance in humans. It also has a short-lived effect as the kidneys become resistant to calcitonin, as indicated by the unaffected excretion of renal calcium in patients with thyroid tumors secreting excessive calcitonin. In the action of guarding bones, calcitonin protects against calcium loss from bones during periods of calcium mobilization, such as pregnancy and, especially, lactation. ", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "Another effect is in preventing postprandial hypercalcemia resulting from the absorption of Ca2+. In addition, calcitonin inhibits food intake in rats and macaques, and may have action on CNS involving the regulation of eating and appetite. Calcitonin lowers blood calcium and phosphorus mainly through inhibition of osteoclasts. Osteoblasts do not have calcitonin receptors and are therefore not directly affected by calcitonin levels. However, since the process of bone resorption and bone formation are processes that go hand in hand, ultimately the inhibition of calcitonin to osteoclastic activity leads to a decrease in osteoblastic activity (as an indirect effect). Calcitonin receptors found in osteoclasts, and in the kidneys and brain regions, are G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), which are associated with Gs for cyclase adenylates and thus produce cAMP in target cells. It can also affect the ovaries in women and testicles in men. Calcitonin was purified in 1962 by Copp and Cheney. Initially this hormone was considered a secretion of the parathyroid gland, only later it was identified as a secretion from the C cells of the thyroid gland. Calcitonin salmon used for treatment: Calcitonin has been researched likely as a non-operative treatment for spinal stenosis. Calcitonin is extracted from the ultimobrankial glands (such as the thyroid gland) of fish, especially salmon. Calcitonin salmon resembles human calcitonin, but is more active. Today, hormones are produced either by recombinant DNA technology or by the synthesis of chemical peptides. The pharmacological properties of synthetic and recombinant peptides have been proven qualitatively and quantitatively equivalent. Calcitonin can be used therapeutic for the treatment of hypercalcemia or osteoporosis. The hormone can be used diagnostically as a tumor marker for medulari thyroid cancer, high levels of calcitonin and increased after surgery likely to indicate a recurrence. Calcitonin can even be used on biopsy samples of suspicious lesions (for example, swollen lymph nodes) to establish whether they are metastases of the original cancer.

Initially, the term referred to an assessment based on a person's race before having relevant information that could be used as the basis for that assessment. Furthermore, prejudice is also applied to areas other than race. Its notion is now an absurd attitude unaffected by John E. Farley's rational reasoning classifies prejudice into three categories. Some types of discrimination occur due to prejudice and in most societies it is disapproved. According to Worchel and colleagues (2000) the notion of prejudice is limited as an unjustified negative trait towards a group and its individual members. Prejudice is a negative behavior that leads a group to an individualist based on limitations or misinformation about the group. Prejudice can also be defined as something emotional, which would very easily be a motivator for the emergence of a social explosion. According to Mar'at (1981), social prejudices are conjectures that have positive or negative values, but are usually more negative in nature. Whereas according to Brehm and Kassin (1993), social prejudice is a negative feeling towards a person based solely on their membership in a particular group. According to David O. Sears and friends (1991), social prejudice is an assessment of a group or an individual that is mainly based on the membership of that group, meaning that social prejudice is aimed at people or groups of people who are different from him or his group. Social prejudice has the quality of liking and dislike the object to which it is prejudiced, and this condition will affect the actions or behavior of the prejudiced person. Furthermore, Kartono (1981), elaborates that prejudice is an overly hasty judgment, based on generalizations that are too fast, one-sided in nature and accompanied by actions that simplify a reality. ", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "Social prejudice according to Papalia and Sally (1985) is a negative attitude directed at another person who is different from his group in the absence of a fundamental reason in the person of the person. It is further elaborated that social prejudice comes from the existence of excessive competition between 2 individuals or groups. In addition, the learning process also plays a role in the formation of social prejudices and all of these will be integrated in a person's personality. Allport (in Zanden, 1984) elaborates that social prejudice is an attitude that hates another group in the absence of an objective reason to hate the group. Furthermore, Kossen (1986) elaborates that social prejudice is an intermediate symptom that asks for pre-legal action, or makes decisions based on insufficient evidence. Thus, if one seeks to understand others well then acts of social prejudice need not occur. According to Sears prejudiced individuals generally have little personal experience with prejudiced groups. Prejudices tend not to be based on objective facts, but are based on minimal facts that are interpreted subjectively. Thus, in this case prejudice involves an a priori assessment because it treats the object of the target of prejudice (the target of prejudice) not based on the unique or specific characteristics of the individual, but attaches the characteristics of his group that stand out. The characteristics of social prejudice according to Brigham (1991) can be seen from the tendency of individuals to create social categories (social categorization). A social category is the tendency to divide the social world into two groups, namely \"our group\" (in group) and \"their group\" (out group). In group is a social group in which the individual feels himself belonging or belonging (\"our group\"). Whereas, an out group is a group outside of one's own group (\"their group\"). The emergence of social prejudice can be seen from the strengthening feelings of in group and out group.

The ruler who ruled the construction of this temple was named Maharaja Tejapurnapana Panangkaran (Rakai Panangkaran) from the Syailendra family. Then by comparison of the manuscripts on the Kelurak inscription this figure can be identified with Dharanindra or with the inscription Nalanda is the father of Samaragrawira.

The top roof has 8 rooms, the second-level roof is 8-faceted, while the lowermost roof is built with a 20-square-shaped temple equipped with statue niches on each side. Kalasan temple has a covering layer of temple called Bajralepa, which is a kind of stucco in fine stone carvings.

In Indonesian is called pe. The letter P comes from the Proto-Semitic letter Pi't meaning \"mouth\", which also derives the Phoenician letter pe, as well as the Greek (Pi) and Etruscan letters that evolved from the Phoenician letter. All of them symbolize the sound /p/, which is a voiceless bicephal popping consonant. The Etruscans adapted the Greek alphabet and changed some of its letter forms, including Pi which symbolizes the sound /p/. The arch on the Etruscan letter P is not closed, and in some variations, the arch is precisely closed; the closed form variation is also a symbol of the /r/ sound in the Etruscan alphabet. The Romans adapted it and designated its shape as P, thus resembling the shape of the letter R in the Etruscan alphabet and the letter Ro in the Greek alphabet. Despite this, the sound value is different. To symbolize the sound /r/, eventually a variant shape of Ro with a diagonal line () was adapted into the letter R by the Romans. In Indonesian, Malay, English and various languages that use the Latin alphabet, the letter P symbolizes the sound of a voiceless bibibir popping consonant. One bilingual in English and French involving the letter P is \"ph\" which signifies the voiceless lip-tooth hissing consonant sound /f/, and is used to translate the letter Phi (\u03c6) into Greek loanwords. In German, the biletter \"pf\" which signifies the lip friction consonant /pf/ is often encountered. Arabic speakers are not used to calling the sound /p/ because in their language there is no sound of this consonant; Instead they tend to call it like /b/ or /v/.

Qop; in Modern Hebrew: Qof/Kof, Arabic: Q\u0101f) is the 19th letter in many alphabets of the Semitic language family, including the Phoenician alphabet, the Aramaic alphabet, the Syriac alphabet, the Hebrew alphabet '\u05e7' and the Arabic alphabet q\u0101f '\u0642' (in alphabetical order). The sound value is the emphatic consonant k\u0295] or q]. The \"Oxford Hebrew English Dictionary\" (OHED) gives the letter \"Qoph\" the transliteration value 'Q' or 'K' and the suffix (final) transliteration value 'ck'. In the Hebrew Gematri, it symbolizes the number 100.

It is also presumed that qof can mean \"ape; monkey\", because the spelling of the word is the same. There are two vocalizations of \"\u05e7\u05d5\u05e3\". In Hebrew, \"qof\" means \"ape; monkey\" but \"quf\" means \"needle\". Both of these pronunciations are equally commonly used. The printed form of this letter is similar to the letter \"P\" in the Indonesian alphabet, with the note that Hebrew Spelling: \u05e7\u05d5\u05b9\u05e3 In modern Hebrew, this letter is also called kuf. Symbolizes the sound /k/; for example, it is not distinguished between Qof and Kaf. However, many groups of historians make a distinction, where Qof is pronounced q] by Iraqi Jews and Mizrahim, or even \u0261] by Yemeni Jews under the influence of Yemeni Arabic.

The name Lenin is actually a pseudonym taken from the name of the Lena River in Siberia. He served as head of government of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFS Russia) from 1917 until his death and also as head of government of the Soviet Union from 1922 until the end of his life. Lenin was in Marxist politics and had contributed his political ideas to Marxist thought referred to as Leninism. His idea, when combined with Marx's economic theory, is known as Marxism\u2013Leninism. Lenin was born the son of a middle-class family in Simbirsk, Russian Empire. His interest in left-wing revolutionary politics began with the death penalty imposed on an older brother in 1887. He briefly studied at Kazan State University, but was expelled for involvement in anti-Tsarist protests, so in the following years he joined the radical political movement as a follower of Marxism. In 1893, he moved to St. Petersburg, becoming a senior figure in the League of Struggles for the Emancipation of the Working Class. Lenin was later arrested for allegedly inciting crowds and exiled for three years to Siberia, where he married Nadezhda Krupskaya. After that, he went into exile in Germany, Great Britain, and Switzerland. He only returned to Russia after the February Revolution of 1917 which led to the downfall of the Tsar and the coming to power of the provisional government. As leader of the Bolshevik faction of the Russian Social Democratic Workers' Party, he played a major role in launching the October Revolution of 1917 that successfully overthrew the Russian Provisional Government and established the Russian RSFS.

The threat from the German Empire forced Lenin to sign a peace treaty marking Russia's exit from World War I. In 1921, he initiated the New Economic Policy, a system of state capitalism that began the process of industrialization and restoration of the post-Russian Civil War state. A year later, the Russian RSFS merged with other territories that once also belonged to the fiefdoms of the Russian Empire to form the Soviet Union with Lenin as its head of government. After his death, Marxism\u2013Leninism developed into several new branches of thought such as Stalinism, Trotskyism, and Maoism. Lenin is still a controversial world figure. His detractors pinned the dictator's stamp on him because he was considered to have violated many human rights during his time in power, while his supporters fought the opinion by assuming that Lenin's power at the time was limited and gave him the title of defender of the workers. Lenin had a major role in the international communist movement and became one of the most influential figures in the world in the 20th century. Lenin's father, Ilya Nikolayevich Ulyanov, came from a family of peasant servants; his ethnic background remains unclear, and it is possible that he is Russian, Chuvash, Mordvin, or Kalmuk. Although he came from the lower class, Ilya managed to advance to the middle class, studied physics and mathematics at Kazan State University, and then taught at the Penza Institute for the Nobility. Ilya married Maria Alexandrovna Blank in mid-1863. Mary was an educated person and came from a fairly prosperous family, and she was also the daughter of a German\u2013Swedish mother and the father of a Russian Jewish doctor who had converted to Christianity.

It should be noted that the term Mao Zedong thought was preferred by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and that the term Maoism was never used in its English publications except in pejorative use. Similarly, Maoist groups outside of China usually call themselves Marxist-Leninist and not Maoist. This reflects Mao's view that he did not change, but rather only developed Marxism-Leninism. Some Maoist groups, however, believe that Mao's theories have provided additional significance to the fundamentals of the Marxist canon, and therefore call themselves \"Marxist-Leninist-Maoist\" (MLM) or \"Maoist\" only. In the PRC, Mao Zedong's thinking is part of the official doctrine of the Chinese Communist Party, but since 1978, the beginning of Deng Xiaoping's renewal of a market economy, with the concept of appearing to the vanguard of \"socialism with Chinese characteristics\" in politics, the enactment of China's economic renewal, and Mao's official definition and ideological pernaissance in the PRC have been radically changed and reduced (see History of China). Outside the PRC, the term Maoism has been used since the 1960s, usually in a negative sense, to describe the parties or people who supported Mao Zedong and his form of communism. Since Mao's death and the renewal by Deng, most parties that expressly call themselves \"Maoists\" have vanished, but various communist groups around the world, particularly armed ones such as the Communist Party of India (Maoists), the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoists) and the New People's Army in the Philippines, have continued to advance Maoist ideas and gained press attention because of it.

Usually one considers that the Maoists took a political line that was anti-revisionist and which was generally more militant than the \"peaceful co-existence\" proposed by the Soviets and their followers after 1956. Usually most Maoists consider Joseph Stalin to be the last true socialist leader of the Soviet Union. In contrast to earlier forms of Marxism-Leninism, in which the urban proletariat was considered the main source of revolution, and rural areas in general were ignored, Mao focused attention on the peasants as the main revolutionary force, which, according to him, could be led by its prolegtarians and bodyguards, the CCP. The model for this was for the prolonged popular wars waged by the Chinese communists in the countryside in the 1920s and 1930s, which eventually ushered the CCP to power. Furthermore, in contrast to other forms of Marxism-Leninism where massive industrial development is seen as a positive force, Maoism makes overall rural development its priority. Mao felt that this strategy made sense in the early stages of socialism in a State where most of the people were peasants. Unlike most other political ideologies, including socialist and Marxist ideologies, Maoism contains integral military doctrines and clearly links its political ideology to military strategy. In Maoist thought, \"political power comes from the muzzle of a rifle \" (one of the quotes of Mao's saying), and the peasant-workers could be mobilized to carry out a \"people's war\" in an armed struggle involving guerrilla warfare in three stages. The first stage involves the mobilization and organization of the workers-peasants.

Antibiotics work by killing or blocking the growth of bacterial populations. A number of antibiotics also have antiprotozoan activity but antibiotics are not effective against viruses. In biotechnology and genetic engineering, antibiotics are also used as a selection tool against mutants or transformants.citation needed] Antibiotics work like pesticides by suppressing or breaking one metabolic chain, only the target is bacterial molecules. Antibiotics differ from disinfectants in that they work, i.e. disinfectants kill germs by creating an unnatural environment for germs to live in.citation needed] Unlike previous infection treatments, which used poisons such as strychnine, antibiotics were dubbed \"magic bullets\": drugs that aimed at the disease without injuring the host. Antibiotics are not effective at treating infections caused by viruses, fungi, or other nonbacteria, and each antibiotic has a wide range of effectiveness against various types of bacteria. There are antibiotics that aim at gram-negative or gram-positive bacteria, some that have a wider spectrum. Its effectiveness also depends on the location of the infection and the ability of antibiotics to reach that site.citation needed] Oral antibiotics (administered by mouth) are easy to use and intravenous antibiotics (via infusion) are used for more serious cases. Antibiotics can sometimes be used locally, such as eye drops and ointments.citation needed] The use of fungi in dealing with infections was first documented by John Parkinson (1567-1650).

The discovery of antibiotics occurred 'accidentally' when Alexander Fleming, in 1928, forgot to clean the bacterial preparations on a petri dish and left it on the washing rack all weekend. On Monday, when the petri dish was about to be cleaned, he noticed that some of the mold had grown in the medium and the part around the mold was 'clean' from the bacteria that had previously filled the medium. Interested in this fact, he conducted further research on the mold, which turned out to be Penicillium chrysogenum syn.

Antibiotics can be classified based on the mechanism of action of such compounds and their chemical structure. There are six groups of antibiotics judging by their target or mechanism of action: Antibiotics generally work very specifically on a process in bacteria, so that in the event of a mutation in the bacteria it allows the emergence of 'immune' strains of bacteria.

Corrosion or rusting process is an electro-chemical process. In the rusting process, iron (Fe) acts as a reducer and oxygen (O2) dissolved in water acts as an oxidizer. The rust formation reaction equation is as follows: Anode: Fe(s) \u2192 Fe2+(aq) + 2e-Cathode: O2(g) + 4H+(aq) + 4e- \u2192 2H2O(l) Rust formed on the metal will accelerate the subsequent rusting process. Therefore, rust is also called autocatalyst. The mechanism of corrosion is that ferrous metals located far from the surface in contact with air will be oxidized by Fe2+ ions. These ions dissolve in water droplets. The place where the oxidation reaction occurs at one end of this water droplet is called an anode. The formed electrons move from the anode to the cathode through the metal. These electrons further reduce oxygen from the air and produce water. The tip of the water droplet at which this reduction reaction occurs is called the cathode. Some oxygen from the air dissolves in water droplets and oxidizes Fe2+ toFe3+ which forms iron rust (Fe2O3.H2O). Rusty iron or metal is brittle, easily soluble, and mixes with other metals, as well as being toxic. This is certainly dangerous and detrimental. If it is rusty, the iron used as the foundation for supporting the bridge becomes brittle so that it is easy to collapse. Means of production in the food and pharmaceutical industry should not use metal that is easy to rust. This is because the rust formed is easily soluble in the food, medicines, or chemical compounds produced. Therefore, for industrial purposes, it is common to use stainless steel equipment.

AM was first found in the adrenal glands of the medulla and feochromositoma tissue derived from the adrenal medulla, and was recognized as a CGRP-like peptide hormone with a length of 52 AA that can lower blood pressure, by increasing cAMP levels in the blood chips. Administration of AM infusion to animals will cause vasodilation with an increase in NO compounds, diuresis, natriuresis and inhibit the secretion of aldosterone. Various studies have shown that an increase in plasma AM in patients with hemorrhagic shock and cardiogenic shock, ischemia-reperfusion injury, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, hypoxia and after undergoing major surgical operations. This is considered a protective mechanism that AM has, but various studies have proven that the single role of AM is not enough to prevent injury to organs, after bleeding or resuscitation occurs.

Dopamine functions as a hormone and neurotransmitter and has an important role in the body and brain. Dopamine is an amine compound synthesized by moving the carboxyl group from the precursor compound L-DOPA, which is synthesized inside the brain and kidneys. In the brains of various types of vertebrate and invertebrate animals, dopamine is a kind of neurotransmitter (a substance that conveys messages from one nerve to another). Inside this brain can also be found several nerve pathways that are affected by dopamine. One of the roles of dopamine is to control the motivational pathways of behavior through reward. The anticipation of receiving such rewards increases the quantity of dopamine inside the brain. Many of those addictive drugs aim to increase dopamine release or block the uptake of dopamine back into the nerves once released. Other dopamine pathways in the brain include control of body movements and the release of other hormones. These pathways form a dopamine system that is a neuroregulator. Dopamine is also a hormone produced by the hypothalamus. Its main function as a hormone is to inhibit the release of prolactin from the pituitary gland. Outside the central nervous system, dopamine serves primarily as a paracrine factor. In blood tissues, dopamine inhibits the release of norepinephrine and serves as a vasodilator (dilates blood vessels at normal concentrations). In the kidneys, dopamine increases the excretion of sodium and the release of urine. In the pancreas, dopamine reduces insulin production. In the digestive system, dopamine reduces motility and protects the intestinal mucosa. In the immune system, dopamine reduces the activity of lymphocytes. Except in the blood vessels, dopamine within each of the aforementioned systems is synthesized locally and affects the surrounding cells (paracrine).

Some of the drugs used work by influencing the effects of dopamine. Parkinson's disease, a degenerative condition that causes tremors and impaired coordination of body movements, is caused by the loss of neurons that release dopamine in an area of the midbrain called sustantia nigra. Its precursor compound, L-DOPA, can be produced in vitro. Levodopa, the pure form of the compound L-DOPA is the most widely used drug for Parkinson's disease because the L-DOPA compound can cross the blood brain barrier. There is scientific evidence that states that schizophrenia is influenced by changes in dopamine activity levels. Most antipsychotic drugs for the treatment of schizophrenia influence the effects of dopamine by reducing such activity. Dopamine antagonist drugs are also used for effective anti-nausea therapy. Restless legs syndrome and attention deficit disorder and hyperactivity have been linked to a lack of dopamine activity. Stimulants to release a lot of dopamine can be addictive in high doses, but in low doses, they are used for the therapy of attention deficit disorder and hyperactivity. Dopamine is also available as a drug for intravenous injection therapy, although this compound cannot reach the brain from blood tissue because it is blocked by the blood brain barrier. The effects of dopamine as an intravenous injection could be used for the treatment of heart failure or shock, especially for newborns. One dopamine compound is made of a catecholamine structure (a benzene ring that has two hydroxyl groups as its side groups) and one amine group connected via an ethyl chain. Therefore, dopamine is the simplest catecholamine compound. Catecholamines are a family of chemical groups that include the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and epinephrine.

This combustor is also known as a burner, combustion chamber or fire holder. In gas turbine engines, the combustion chamber is fed to a high-pressure air by a compression system. The combustor then heats this air at constant pressure. After heating, air passes from the combustion chamber through the nozzle propeller guide for the turbine. In the case of ramjet or scramjet engines, air is directly fed to the nozzle. The function of the combustion chamber is to convert the pressure enegi into thermal energy through the combustion process. The three types of combustion chambers used in jet engines are can, annular and can-annular types The can type consists of a combustion chamber arranged individually in the form of tubes (cans), mounted in a circle around the engine shaft, each of which receives air through a cylindrical shroud on each can. One of the disadvantages of using a can type of combustion chamber is the use of a relatively larger space in the form of a larger engine diameter. The advantages include easy maintenance, because it is easy to remove individually for inspection purposes. In addition, the pattern of bursts of fuel and fuel mixtures is easy to adjust compared to the annular type. The annular type is a combustion chamber with a single chamber of concentric cylindrical shape attached around the engine axis. The array is efficient in discharging, relatively small pressure loss, easy to install with compressor/turbine axis installation, high efficiency. One of the disadvantages is the problem of structure that tends to increase the diameter of the engine. In addition, it is more difficult to maintain because for maintenance the entire combustion chamber must be removed. The can-annular type is a combination of can and annular types, thus eliminating losses and taking advantage of the can and annular types.

The air flow around the nozzle comes from the air that goes through the first row of air holes on the liner. The airflow on the front liner circulates in the forward direction (upstream) or in the direction against the fuel burst. This condition is useful for accelerating the air mixing process and avoiding flame blowout by forming a low-speed stable area. Usually in one engine there are only two ignitors, therefore a cross ignitor tube is needed to help burn can and can-annular types. Ignitor plugs are usually installed in the upstream flow region of the combustion chamber (reverse-flow region). After ignition, the combustion will spread the area of the primary combustion chamber where the mixture of fuel and air can perfectly burn. Only about one-third to half of the amount of air allowed into the combustion. Of these only about a quarter are used in the combustion process. The combustion gas has a temperature of about 3500 F (1900 C). Before entering the turbine, the combustion gas must be cooled to half of the temperature. Cooling is carried out by the flow of air entering through large holes in the rear liner. In addition, the inner walls of the liner must also be protected from high temperatures. For this reason, it is cooled by flowing cold air in several places along the liner, thus forming a blanket that limits the hot gas with the liner walls. The function of the turbine is to rotate the compressor and its accessories. Jet engines usually use about 75% power to rotate the compressor, while the rest is used to produce thrust. The exhaust duct receives high-pressure, low-speed air outward from the turbine wheel, then accelerates the airflow at sonic or supersonic speeds through the nozzle.

Believed to be one of the oldest symbols in the world, dating back some 4000 years (based on findings on tombs in Aladja-hoyuk, Turkey), various variations of the Swastika can be found in archaeological remains (coins, ceramics, weapons, jewelry or religious altars) scattered over a very wide geographical area. The geographical area includes Turkey, Greece, Crete, Cyprus, Italy, Persia, Egypt, Babylonia, Mesopotamia, India, Tibet, China, Japan, Scandinavian and Slavic countries, Germany to America. The word Swastika consists of the word Su which means good, the word Asti which means is and the suffix Ka which forms the adjective into a noun. So that the Swastika emblem is a form of symbol or image from the applied word Swastyastu (Hopefully in good condition). This symbol, known by various names such as Tetragammadion in Greece or Fylfot in England, occupies an important position in the beliefs and cultures of ancient nations, such as the Trojans, Hittites, Kelts and Teutons. This symbol can be found in Hindu, Jaina and Buddhist temples as well as Christian churches (St. Sophia Church in Kiev, Ukraine, St. Ambrose Basilica, Milan, as well as Amiens Cathedral, France), Islamic mosques (in Ishafan, Iran and Tayenl Mosque, Lebanon) as well as the Jewish synagogue of Ein Gedi in Judea. The swastika was (and still is) representing things of a sublime and sacred nature, especially for Hindus, Jainanes, Buddhists, adherents of the Gallic-Roman faith (whose main altars are decorated with lightning, swastikas and wheels), adherents of ancient Celtic beliefs (swastika symbolizing the Fire Goddess Brigit), adherents of the ancient Slavic beliefs (the swastika symbolizing the Sun God Svarog) as well as for the Hopi and Navajo Indians (who used the symbol in healing rituals).

In fact, the swastika was also once a symbol of the NSDAP (otherwise known as the Nazis) political party when Hitler used it as a representative of the superiority of the Aryans. Millions of Jews and German traitors died at the hands of soldiers who wore the swastika emblem (the \"sinistrovere\" Swastika: tilted to the left about 45 degrees) on his arms. Swastika also has many meanings, if clockwise it means containing things that are or contain good. Meanwhile, if it is counterclockwise, it is a form of ugliness and is widely used by wizards - wizards in ancient times. A clockwise swastika also means following the current rules and habits of life that apply in society in general (clockwise = clockwise = in the direction of the time rotation of life on earth), while if it is counterclockwise it is an act that is opposite to all the currents of rules and habits that develop in society, this can mean good or bad (counterclockwise = counterclockwise to the rotation of earth time / opposite to all  a common thing in life in general, symbolizing the terrifying Batara Kala). For example: If we live in a bad and negative environment then it is a good thing if we do not follow it, on the contrary if we live in a good and positive environment but we do not heed it, it means that our actions are negative.

But only Luke pointed directly in the question, 'Who are our neighbors?' (Luke 10:29-37) Jesus then replied in the Parable of the good Samaritan, that loving neighbors are not only one tribe, one blood, and one group, that is, both Jews, but those who love sincerely, like the good Samaritan. So filia love should be shown not exclusively, but to everyone. Etymologically, filia comes from the Greek phileo, which is love that is equal or synonymous with the bonds of brotherhood, comradeship, and citizenship. The use of this word is prevalent and is spoken of in the Greek city of Athens. Aristotle in Nicomachean Ethics says, \"We think, we should show more of our respect (charizethai) to the people of our brethren (Greek: philoi) than to strangers (Greek: othneiois). So, filia does occupy a better level to neighbors, to relatives, and to like-mindedness than to people we don't know. The literature from Homer gives a somewhat different understanding of philia, namely regarding pleasure, problems, profits, and obligations.

Kansas is a landlocked state bordering Nebraska to the north; Missouri to the east; Oklahoma to the south; and Colorado to the west. Kansas is named after the Kansas River where the Kansa people live, the designation of the Native Americans who lived along its banks. The name of the tribe (originally kk\u0105:ze) is often said to mean \"people of the (southern) wind\" although the naming may not be the original meaning of the term. For thousands of years, what is now referred to as Kansas was home to many and varied Native American tribes. The tribes in the eastern part of the state generally live in villages along the river valley. The tribes of the western part of the state were semi-nomadic and hunted large herds of bison animals. The first Euro-American settlement in Kansas occurred in 1827 at Fort Leavenworth. The pace of settlements was rapid in the 1850s, amid a political war over the slavery debate. When it was officially opened for settlement by the United States government in 1854 with the Kansas-Nebraska Act, Free-Staters abolitionists from New England and pro-slavery settlers from neighboring Missouri rushed to the region to determine and scramble over whether Kansas would become a free state or a state of slavery. Thus, the area was a hotbed of violence and chaos in the early days when forces from both sides clashed, and became known as Bloody Kansas. The abolitionists won, and on January 29, 1861, Kansas entered the Union as a free state, therefore it earned the nickname \"The Free State.\" In 2015, Kansas was one of the most productive agricultural states with high yields, producing wheat, corn, sorghum, and soybeans.

The inhabitants of Kansas are called Kansanites. Mount Sunflower is the highest point of the plain in Kansas at 4,039 feet (1,231 meters). The naming of Kansas is derived from the Algonquian term Akansa which means Quapaw people. The naming refers to the Dhegiha Siouan-speaking people who settled in Arkansas around the 13th century. The root of the word -kansa is a nickname of the Kaw people, also known as the Kansa, a federally recognized Native American tribe. Before European colonization, Kansas was occupied by the Caddoan Wichita and later the Siouan Kaw people. The first European to set foot in present-day known Kansas was the Spanish conquistador Francisco V\u00e1zquez de Coronado who explored the area in 1541.

Heraklius first appeared on the political stage in 617 AD, while leading a rebellion to overthrow Emperor Fokas with his father, Heraklius the Elder. During his reign, the Eastern Roman Empire launched a number of military campaigns. Heraklius ascended the throne at a time when his country's borders were undermined by foreigners. He immediately launched a war against the Sasani Persian Empire that lasted from 602 to 628. The first battles of this war were won by the Persians. The Persian armed forces braved all the way to the Bosforus Strait, but Constantinople was protected by solid walls and a formidable navy so that Heraklius escaped a crushing defeat. Not long after, he initiated efforts to reorganize and strengthen the military of the Eastern Roman Empire. Heraklius was finally able to expel the Persians from Asia Minor, even lunging into Persian sovereign territory and defeating the country's armed forces decisively in the Battle of Nineveh in 627.

The new Persian emperor immediately sought a peace deal by offering the return of all areas that Persia had annexed from Eastern Rome. In this way, peace relations between the two countries have been established again. Many areas newly retaken from Persia eventually fell into the hands of Muslim-Arab forces.

With Islam as a unifying element, the Arabs became one of the strongest countries in the region. Eastern Rome's first conflict with the Muslim-Arabs was the Battle of Mu'tah in September 629. A small army of Muslim-Arabs invaded Arabian province after the Muslim ambassador was killed by the Mayor of Arabia from Bani Ghassan, but this invasion can be broken. Not to be outdone, the Eastern Roman government did not seek to change the military order that already existed in the province of Arabia. After all, Eastern Romans very rarely fought against the Arabs, in fact, less often fought against the jihadi forces united by a prophet.

Bogor is planned as an agricultural area and a resting place for the Governor-General. With these developments, the Bogor area began to develop. A year later, van Imhoff merged 9 districts (Cisarua, Pondok Gede, Ciawi, Ciomas, Cijeruk, Sindang Barang, Balubur, Dramaga, and Kampung Baru) into one government called Regentschap Kampung Baru Buitenzorg. In that area van Imhoff then built a Governor-General's Palace. In subsequent developments, the name Buitenzorg was used to designate the areas of Puncak, Telaga Warna, Megamendung, Ciliwung, Muara Cihideung, to the top of Mount Salak, and the peak of Mount Gede. During the British occupation, the Governor General was Thomas Stamford Raffles, he was quite instrumental in developing the City of Bogor, where the Bogor Palace was renovated and part of the land was used as a Botanical Garden, he also employed a Planner named Carsens who arranged Bogor as a resting place known as Buitenzorg.

This rifle was adopted and made the standard rifle of the USSR in 1947. When compared to the rifles used during World War II, the AK-47 has a smaller size, with a shorter range, uses bullets with a smaller 7.62 x 39 mm caliber, and has a selective-fire option. The AK-47 was one of the first assault rifles and is by far the most widely produced assault rifle. In World War II, Germany created the concept of making medium-power bullets just like other countries. This is based on the experience that modern battles occur more at a fairly close distance, which is about 300 meters. The power and range of the bullet at the time turned out to be too great. Thus, Germany began to develop shells. In the end, Heereswaffenamt contracted the Polte Werke company to develop this cartridge. Just like other countries, the Soviets developed medium-power cartridges before the war, but the results of these developments and tests and new cartridges were not satisfied. At the war, the Soviets were aware that they needed a new cartridge, since from the combat data an effective firing range was usually at a distance of 600m-800 m. In 1942 the Soviets got the Mkb.42(H) rated as Germany's new submachine gun, coupled with the M1 Carbine from lend lease, making the Soviets interested in making intermediate power cartridges with examples of .30 Carbine and 7.92x33 mm Kurz bullets. The first prototype of this medium-power cartridge was made in 1944 with a container length of 41 mm, at the end of 1944 began the development of semiautomatic rifles, machine guns and submachine guns using this cartridge to replace all old Soviet rifles.

However, the results of the designers did not meet the specifications given, this made these rifles more similar to submachine guns than submachine guns. All designs can use bipods and bayonets, when tested for accuracy most designs have a large bullet dispersion. The final decision on the commissioner of this competition judged that the design given could not replace PPSh and PPS, finally it was decided to continue this competition, in this competition only the design from Sudayev (AS-44) has high durability and efficiency.

Today, Toyota is the world's largest manufacturer of cars. In addition to producing cars, Toyota also provides financial services, and also makes robots. TMC is a member of the Toyota Group and produces cars under the Toyota, Lexus, Daihatsu and Hino brands, and owns a small part of Subaru, Isuzu,Toyota Daihatsu Toyota Motor Corporation was founded in September 1933 as the automobile division of the Toyoda Automatic Weaving Plant. The company's automobile division was spun off on August 27, 1937 to create Toyota Motor Corporation as it is today. Departing from the textile industry, the company, which produces 1 car every 50 minutes, turns out to use the Toyota naming more because the mention is more palatable than using the founder's surname, Toyoda. Here are some interesting milestones of Toyota's journey. Toyota is the world's largest car manufacturer in unit sales and net sales. Japan's largest manufacturer produces 8-8.5 million units of cars worldwide each year. Compared to other automotive industries that use the founder's name as a trademark such as Honda founded by Soichiro Honda, Daimler-Benz (Gottlieb Daimler and Karl Benz), Ford (Henry Ford), the name Toyoda is not used as a brand. Because it departed from the simple thinking and vision of the time, the mention of Toyoda was not pleasant to hear and was not familiar so it was missed as Toyota. Sakichi Toyoda was born in February 1867 in Shizuoka, Japan. This man is known as an inventor since he was in his teens. Toyoda devoted his life to studying and developing textile assembly. ", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "In the age of 30 Toyoda completed the weaving machine. This led him to establish the forerunner of Toyota assembly, the Toyoda Automatic Loom Works, Ltd. in November 1926. Here the patent rights of his automatic textile machinery were later sold to Platt Brothers & Co, Ltd. of England, United Kingdom. The proceeds from the sale of this patent were used as capital for the development of the automotive division. Starting in 1933, when Toyoda built the automotive division, the team, which was then largely controlled by his son Kiichiro Toyoda, continued to produce the leading innovations of his time. The Type A engine was successfully completed in 1934. A year later this engine grafted the first prototype of their passenger car, the A1. Toyoda's automotive division also produces G1 model trucks. In 1936 they launched their first passenger car, the Toyoda AA (at that time it still used the name Toyoda). This model was developed from the prototype of the A1 model and equipped with a body and engine A. This vehicle from the beginning was expected to be a people's car. Four years of waiting was enough to give birth to its own automotive company and break away from their textile industry. Then in 1937 they inaugurated the automotive division and used the name Toyota instead of Toyoda as the name of the textile industry suggests. The name Toyota in Japanese is represented in 8 characters, and eight is a lucky number for Japanese people. Another reason it makes sense is that the automotive industry is a lifestyle business and even the mention of a name (and what it sounds like), becomes such an important side. Because the name Toyoda was considered too rigid in a dynamic business, it was changed to Toyota which was felt to be better. No doubt, 1937 was an important era of the birth of Toyota Motor Co., Ltd. the forerunner of the giant Toyota Motor Corp. (TMC) today.

Planning, debriefing, and contraceptive use are called family planning. Safe sex, such as the use of female or male condoms, can also help prevent sexually transmitted infections. The method of regulating birth has been used since ancient times, but effective and safe methods were available only in the 20th century. In some cultures access to contraception is restricted because it is considered inappropriate both morally and politically. The most effective methods of contraception are sterilization with vasectomy in men and binding of the fallopian tubes/fallopian tubes in women, intrauterine contraceptives (AKDR/IUD) and implanted contraceptives (birth control swabs). This was followed by a number of hormonal contraceptives including oral pills, koyo, vaginal rings, and injectables. Less effective methods include bariers such as condoms, diaphragms, and contraceptive sponges as well as natural family planning methods. Less effective methods are spermicids and copulation cut off by men before ejaculation. Sterilization, although very effective, is usually not reversible; All other methods are reversible, mostly as soon as they are discontinued. Emergency contraception can prevent pregnancy within days of unprotected sex. Some consider abstinence from sex to be a contraception, but sex education that relies solely on abstinence can increase pregnancy in adolescence if it is not accompanied by contraceptive education. In adolescents, pregnancy has a greater risk of ending badly. Comprehensive sex education and access to contraception lower rates of unwanted pregnancies in this age group. While all forms of contraception can be used by young people, long-term reversible contraceptive methods such as implants, IUD/IUD, or vaginal rings are particularly beneficial in lowering teen pregnancy rates. ", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "After giving birth, women who do not breastfeed exclusively can become pregnant again in four to six weeks. Some methods of contraception can be started immediately after childbirth, but others need to be postponed to six months. For those who breastfeed exclusively the progestin method is preferred in comparison with combined oral contraceptives. Those who have reached menopause are advised to continue contraception until a year after the last menstruation. There are approximately 222 million women who want to avoid pregnancy in developing countries that do not use modern contraceptive methods. Contraceptive use in developing countries has reduced maternal mortality by 40% (about 270,000 deaths in 2008 were preventable) and could prevent up to 70% if all contraceptive needs were met. By extending the time between pregnancies, contraception can improve the success of childbirth in adult women as well as the survival of their children. For women in developing countries, their children's income, assets, weight, and education and health levels will increase in parallel with increased access to contraception. Contraception boosts economic growth due to less burden on children, more women participating in labor, and reduced consumption of limited resources. Contraceptive methods include barier methods, hormonal contraceptives, intrauterine contraceptives (AKDR), sterilization, and behavioral methods. This method is used before or during sex whereas emergency contraception is effective up to a few days after sex. Effectiveness is usually expressed as the percentage of women who become pregnant after using a given method during their first year and sometimes as a lifetime failure rate among methods with high effectiveness, such as tubal/fallopian tube binding. The most effective methods are those that are durable and do not require constant health care visits.

He is best known as a writer and scholar, and his masterpiece, the Historia Ecclesiastica Gentis Anglorum (Ecclesiastical History of the English Nation) earned him the title \"Father of British History\". Beda was known as Venerabilis Beda (Latin: Beda Venerabilis, English: Venerable Bede, more or less translated as Distinguished Difference) soon after his death, but this designation has nothing to do with the granting of saint status by the Roman Catholic Church. In fact, this title is believed to have originated from the mistranslation of the Latin sentence engraved on his tomb inside Durham Cathedral, which supposedly reads Here lay the venerable bones of the Beda, yet mistranslated as Here lay the bones of the Honourable Beda. The name \"Beda\" bears a resemblance to the name \"B\u012beda\" in the Old English dialect of Western Saksen (B\u01e3da in Northumbrian dialect, B\u0113da in Anglian dialect). It is a short English-Saksen name formed from the root word b\u0113odan meaning \"to exhort\" or \"to order\". The name also appears in the English-Saksen Chronicle, s.a. 501, as Bieda, the name of one of the sons of the leader of the Stanggung people who founded the town of Portsmouth. Two priests with this name are recorded in the Liber Vitae (Book of Biography) of Durham Cathedral, allegedly one of whom is Saint Beda.

The compilation of this paper was completed around 731. Beda states that he was fifty-nine years old at the time, so it is estimated that he was born in 672 or 673.a] Another source of information is a letter written by Beda's disciple Kutbertus (not Saint Kutbertus mentioned in Beda's paper), which narrates the end of Beda's life.b] In his paper, Beda mentions that he was born in \"the customary land of this monastery\". The monastery he was referring to was the twin monasteries of Monkwearmouth and Jarrow, in present-day Sunderland, claimed to be his birthplace; there is also another history that mentions that he was born at Monkton, two miles away from the monastery at Jarrow. Beda gives no description of his origins, but his close relationship with people of noble descent implies that he also came from a distinguished family. Beda's first abas was Benedict Biscop, and the inclusion of the name \"Biscop\" along with \"Beda\" in Lindsey's list of kings from about 800, further reinforced the conjecture that Beda was a son of a noble family. At the age of seven, Beda was sent to Monkwearmouth monastery by his family to be educated by Benedict Biscop and later by Ceolfrith. Beda did not say whether at that time he had intended to become a monk. It was common in Ireland then for young boys, especially of the nobility, to be educated outside the home; this practice seems to be common among Germanic people in England as well. Another monastery related to Monkwearmouth in Jarrow was founded by Ceolfrith in 682, and Beda was probably transferred to Jarrow with Ceolfrith that year.

Subduction zones can occur both between two continental plates, between two oceanic plates and between continental and oceanic plates. The oceanic crust usually sinks into the mantle under the lighter continental crust. The destruction of the oceanic crust due to subduction can form a continental crust. Due to the difference in density between the two types of plates, one lighter plate must rise above the other, forcing the heavier plate down the mantle. The plate enters the magma and eventually melts completely. This difference in density can occur due to differences in the composition, age, type of rocks that make up the earth's plates. The subduction zone is the area where two plates meet that form a row of volcanoes and earthquakes. The area of inter-plate confluence at the location of the subduction zone is referred to as an earthquake fault, or a megathrust. Scientists first identified subduction zones in the 1960s, by placing earthquakes in the descending crust. Subduction causes the formation of sea troughs, for example the Mariana trough, as well as causes the formation of mountains. Two parallel mountains usually develop above the subduction zone - coastal mountains consisting of sedimentary layers and hard rocks lifted from the sea (accretion wedges), and volcanic mountains further inland (volcanic arcs). Volcanoes that occur along this border zone, for example the peaks of Saint Helens and Krakatau, are referred to as subduction zone volcanoes. The movement of tectonic plates themselves is caused by hot convection currents. Meanwhile, this difference in density occurs as a result of the types of rocks on these two plates are different. ", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "On oceanic plates the rocks are more alkaline than continental plates. In addition to the confluence of two plates, tectonic activity is also caused by faults. The subduction zone is thus an earth's interior system of unparalleled scale and complexity. Subduction zones occur around the Pacific Ocean, off the coasts of Washington, Canada, Alaska, Russia, Japan and Indonesia. Called the \"Ring of Fire\", this subduction zone is responsible for the world's largest earthquake, the most terrible tsunami, and some of the worst volcanic eruptions. There are several interesting theories as to why Subduction occurs in the earth's crust. One common theory is that subduction was created by a major impact of an asteroid or comet early in Earth's history. This makes a lot of sense because of the geological evidence of a major impact scattered around the world. Another widely accepted idea of how subduction zones are formed suggests that a piece of lempemg begins to spontaneously sink into the mantle. This, then, creates a fissure on the earth's surface filled with magma that produces a new and young crust. Only after a million years, the sinking plates become heavy enough to begin pulling the two plates together, creating a horizontal plate movement and regular subduction. Subduction is one of several ways that plate tectonics interact with each other. Because any interaction can produce natural hazards such as earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanoes, and landslides. Subduction zones can give rise to earthquakes. The continental crust that collides, stores the energy released during an earthquake. The scale of the subduction zones means they can cause very large earthquakes. The largest earthquakes ever recorded were in the subduction zone, such as the 9.5 scale in Chile in 1960 and 9.2 in Alaska in 1964.

Not long after his studies, he began a 43-year career (from July 1940-March 1983) at Bell Telephone Laboratories, where he received more than 70 American patents in the field of telecommunications, specifically in the field of switching. Amos E Joel Jr, made a mobile phone switching system from one cell region to another. This switching should work when the mobile phone user moves or moves from one cell to another so that the conversation is not interrupted. It was because of the invention of Amos Joel that the use of mobile phones became convenient. In addition to functioning to make and receive telephone calls, mobile phones generally also have the function of sending and receiving short messages (SMS). There are also mobile phone service providers in several countries that provide third generation (3G) services by adding videography services, as a means of payment, as well as for online television on their mobile phones. Now, mobile phones are becoming multifunctional devices. Following the development of digital technology, mobile phones are now also equipped with a wide selection of features, such as being able to capture radio and television broadcasts, audio (MP3) and video player software, digital cameras, games, and internet services (WAP, GPRS, 3G, 4G, 5G). In addition to these features, mobile phones are now implanted with computer features. So in the mobile phone, people can turn the function of the mobile phone into a minicomputer.

UBS was founded in 1862 as Bank in Winterthur along with the birth of the Swiss banking industry. During the 1890s, the Swiss Bank Corporation (SBC) was founded, forming a private banking syndicate that later flourished thanks to Switzerland's international neutrality. In 1912, the Bank of Winterthur merged with Toggenburger Bank to form the Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS) and grew rapidly after the Banking Law of 1934 formulated Swiss banking secrecy. After decades of competition, UBS and SBC merged in 1998 to form \"UBS\".nb 3] UBS does not stand for \"Union Bank of Switzerland\". In fact, there were more than 370 financial institutions that later merged to form UBS which still exists today.

According to the letter, sent by St. Paul, Onesiforus sought out Paul who was imprisoned while in Rome. According to Orthodox tradition, Saint Onesifours was one of the seventy disciples whom Jesus chose and sent as herald. They were chosen several times after the election of the Twelve Apostles (Luke 10:1-24). St. Onesiforus became bishop in Colophone (Asia Minor), and later in Corinth. Both the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church consider that he died as a martyr in the town of Parium (not far from Ephesus) on the coast of Hellespontos. The persecution of Christians during the reign of Emperor Nero made Rome a dangerous city for Christians. Paul praised Onesiforus for his hospitality, kindness, and courage. Onesiforus was contrasted with other Christians in Asia who had left Paul at the time. In 2 Timothy 1:16-18, Paul salutes the Onesiforus family in Ephesus. Timothy, who led the Ephesian church, seems to have known of his actions. Paul's praise of Onesiforus is important because it was written shortly before Paul's death as his final encouragement to Timothy. Because Paul spoke of Onesiforus only in the past tense, extending blessings to his family, and begging for mercy for him \"on His day\", some scholars believe that at that time Onesirous had passed away. Towards the end of the same epistle, in 2 Timothy 4:19, Paul salutes \"Priska and Aquila and to the family of Onesiforus\", apparently once again distinguishing the state of Onesiforus from that of the surviving Priska and Aquila. Paul's reference to Onesiforus, along with 2 Maccabees 12:40-46, is cited by Catholics as one of the earliest examples of prayer for the dead, while some Protestants who oppose the practice reject this kind of interpretation.

In 1974, Pirelli created a \"wide radial tyre\", on demand from the Lancia rally team, who wanted tires strong enough to support the power of the Lancia Stratos. At that time, there were only two types of racing tires, namely slick tires made with a cross ply technique (tires with a very wide tread, but reduced tire side height), or radial tires that were too narrow to support Stratos' power and could not provide enough grip. Both types of tires are also not suitable for the Lancia Stratos, because the radial tires disintegrate after being used for 10 km, while the slick is too rigid. Lancia also asked Pirelli for a solution, and in 1975, Pirelli created a wide tire with the side height of the tire reduced, making it look like a slick, but with a radial structure. Later, Porsche also started using the same tires for the Porsche 911 Turbo. In 1988, Pirelli acquired Armstrong Rubber Company, headquartered in New Haven, Connecticut, for $190 million.

Labovitz and Hagedorn define theory as the idea of \"theoretical thought\" thought which they define as \"determining\" how and why variables and statements of relationships can be interconnected. The word theory has different meanings in different areas of knowledge depending on the methodology and context of the discussion. In general, a theory is an analysis of the relationship between one fact and another on a set of facts . Moreover, in contrast to theorems, theoretical statements are generally accepted only on a \"temporary\" basis and are not conclusive final statements. This indicates that theory comes from drawing conclusions that have the potential for error, as opposed to drawing conclusions on mathematical proof. While more specifically in the social sciences, there is also social theory. Neuman defines social theory as a system of interrelationships of abstractions or ideas that summarize and organize knowledge about the social world. It is necessary to know that theory is different from idiology, a researcher is sometimes biased in distinguishing theory and ideology. There are similarities between the kedunya, but obviously they are different. Theories can be part of ideology, but ideology is not a theory. An example is Human Aleniation is a theory expressed by Karl Marx, but Marxist or Communism as a whole is an ideology. In science, theory in science means a model or frame of mind that explains a natural phenomenon or a certain social phenomenon. Theories are formulated, developed and evaluated according to the scientific method. A theory is also a hypothesis that has been proven to be true. Man builds theories to explain, foresee, and master certain phenomena (for example, inanimate objects, events in nature, or animal behavior).

A theory forms a generalization over many observations and consists of a collection of coherent and interrelated ideas. The term theoretical can be used to describe something that is foreseen by a theory but has never been observed. For example, until recently, black holes were categorized as theoretical because they were foreseen according to the general theory of relativity but have never been observed in nature. There is a misconception that if a scientific theory has obtained enough evidence and has been tested by other researchers, it will become a scientific law. This is not true because the definitions of scientific law and scientific theory are different. Theory will remain a theory, and law will remain a law. In a theory there are several elements that follow. This element serves to unite the variables contained in the theory. The first element is the concept. A concept is an idea expressed with a symbol or word. The concept is divided into two namely, symbols and definitions. In the natural sciences the concept can be expressed with such symbols as, \"\u221e\" = infinity, \"m\"= Mass, and others. However, in the social sciences this concept is expressed more by words rather than through symbols. According to Neuman words are also symbols because language itself is a symbol. Because learning concepts and theories is like learning language. The concept is always everywhere and we always use it. For example, we are talking about education. Education is a concept, it is an abstract idea that is only in our minds. The second element is the Scope. In the theory as described above has a concept.

This term usually refers to the application of mathematics to the subject. Fluid statics includes the study of fluid conditions in a stable equilibrium state. The use of fluid to perform work is called hydraulics, and the science of fluid in a moving state is referred to as fluid dynamics. Due to its nature that cannot be easily compressed, the fluid can generate normal pressure on all surfaces in contact with it. At rest (static), the pressure is isotropic, that is, it acts with the same magnitude in all directions. This characteristic allows the fluid to transmit force along a pipe or tube, that is, if a force is applied to the fluid in a pipe, then the force will be transmitted to the end of the pipe. If there is an opposing force at the end of the pipe that is not equal in magnitude to the transmitted force, then the fluid will move in a direction corresponding to the direction of the resultant force. His concept was first formulated, in a rather broad form, by the French mathematician and philosopher Blaise Pascal in 1647 which became known as Pascal's Law. This law has many important applications in hydraulics. Galileo Galilei, was also the great father in hydrostatics. Hydrostatic pressure is the pressure applied to a liquid that is at rest or equilibrium due to the influence of gravitational forces. The magnitude of the hydrostatic pressure obtained by a substance is determined by the magnitude of gravity due to the position of the depth/height and density of the liquid. A small volume of fluid at a certain depth in a vessel will apply upward pressure to compensate for the weight of the fluid on it. For a very small volume, the voltage is equal in all directions, and the weight of the fluid present above the very small volume is equivalent to the pressure formulated as follows with (in SI units), P is the hydrostatic pressure (in pascals); \u03c1 is the density of the fluid (in kilograms per cubic meter); g is the acceleration of gravity (in meters per second squared); h is the height of the fluid column (in meters). ", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "A solid that is immersed in a fluid will experience a buoyancy force equal in magnitude to the weight of the fluid being displaced. This is due to the hydrostatic pressure of the fluid. For example, a container ship can float because its weight force is offset by the buoyancy force of the water being displaced. The more cargo loaded, the lower the ship's position in the water, so the more water is \"moved\", and the greater the buoyancy force that acts. The principle of this apungan was invented by Archimedes. The fluid will exert pressure on any plane of the surface that intersects with it. Pressure can be interpreted as the force acting on a surface divided by surface area. The explanation can be written in the form of an equation as follows. P=FA{\\displaystyle P={F \\over A}} Where: P{\\displaystyle P} = Pressure (N/m\u00b2 / Pa) F{\\displaystyle F} = Force (N) A{\\displaystyle A} = Area (m\u00b2) The pressure at a certain depth is also influenced by the atmospheric pressure that compresses the upper surface of the liquid layer, so it can be used to determine the total pressure at a certain depth in the liquid and formulated as follows.

Despite this, in the cultivation of this plant its height is made no more than 5m but with an expanded sideways heading. This is done in order to multiply productive branches. Cocoa flowers, like other members of the Sterculiaceae, grow directly from the stem (cauliflorous). Flowers are perfectly small in size (maximum diameter 3 cm), single, but appear entrenched because often a number of flowers emerge from one point of budding. Pollination of flowers is carried out by insects (mainly small flies (midge) Forcipomyia, winged ants, afids, and some Trigona bees) that usually occur at night1. The flower is ready to be pollinated in a period of several days. Cocoa in general is a cross-pollinating plant and has its own incompatibility system (see pollination). However, some varieties of cocoa are able to self-pollinate and produce types of commodities with a higher selling value. Fruits grow from pollinated flowers.

If the Septuagint reading \"Gesem\" is considered appropriate, then the word which in Hebrew form is not known for its meaning can be interpreted as \"matched\" \u2014 compared to the Arabic root j-\u0161-m, \"work.\" Egyptologists see a link to the Egyptian word qas, meaning \"flooded land,\" since Gosyen seems to be in the same region as what the Greeks call the \"Arabian nome,\" with the capital at Phakousa translated from the Egyptian \"Pa-qas\" (Brugsch, Geog., I, 298), the name of the city, with the determinative \"flowing outwards\". Donald Redford did not dispute the location of Gosyen, but gave the origin a different name, deriving from \"Gasmu,\" the rulers of the Bedouin tribe of the Kedar people who inhabited the area east of the Delta from the 7th century BC, but John Van Seters considered this impossible. Although many are looking for an Egyptian meaning for \"Gosyen\", it seems that its only meaning is through Hebrew because it seems that the word only means something to the Hebrews who lived there. The ancient rabbis who divided the Torah into weekly readings emphasized that they saw the name \"Gosyen\" (Goshen) as related to the verb \"NaGaSh\" (\u05e0\u05b4\u05d2\u05b7\u05bc\u05e9\u05c1), \"approaching.

Because of the news that Egypt was the only kingdom that could provide food, the sons of Jacob (Israel) went there to buy food. In the second year of the drought season, the Vizier of Egypt, Joseph, invited the sons of Israel to live in Egyptian territory. They settled in the lands of Gosyen. Gosyen is described as the best land in Egypt, suitable for planting and grazing cattle. It is implied that this location may have been somewhat separate from the common land of Egypt, for Genesis 46:34 states, \"\"with the intention that ye may dwell in the land of Gosyen.\" --For all sheep shepherds were an abomination to the Egyptians\" After the death of Joseph and his generation, their descendants, the Israelites, doubled in number. Egyptians who feared the potential for integration or takeover of power decided to make them slaves and oppress their rights. About four hundred and thirty years later, Moses was called by God to lead the Israelites out of Egypt, departing from Gosyen to Sukot (Succoth), the site of the first stopover in the Exodus. They then camped at 41 locations after crossing the Nile Delta, all the way to the final stopover on the plains of Moab (plains of Moab). In 1885 E.H. Naville identified Gosyen as the 20th Egyptian nome, located in the eastern part of the Delta, and known as \"Gesem\" or \"Kesem\" during the time of Egypt's 26th Dynasty (672-525 BC). Its territory includes Wadi Tumilat on the western boundary, with the eastern boundary of the district \"Succoth\" (Sukot), with Pitom as its main city, stretching north as far as the ruins of Pi-ramesse (\"land of Rameses\"), and includes both farmland and grazing fields.

This group is recognized as a taxon (as a class as well as a subclass) in various plant classification systems and got various names, such as Monocotyledoneae, Liliopsida, and Liliidae. Based on phylogeny analysis, this group is known to be monophyletic or holophyletic. The APG II classification system recognizes monocotyledons as clades called Monocotyledons. This group of plants includes a variety of the most useful plants in human life. As a source of food, a source of vegetable energy, a source of industrial raw materials, housing, decoration, clothing, writing media, coloring agents, and so on. There are about 50 thousand to 60 thousand known types; according to the IUCN there are 59,300 types.

The reason for the formation of the seasons is because the Earth goes around the Sun and rotates its axis. This tilt of the Earth's rotation reaches 23.5 degrees from its perpendicular axis. Countries located far from the equator have four seasons: summer, autumn, winter, and spring. Meanwhile, countries that are close to the equator have two seasons, namely the rainy season and the dry season. A characteristic of the seasons is the presence of weather conditions that most often occur within a certain time span. Each season is recognized through the weather conditions that occur. The naming of seasons according to their circumstances can be observed in the rainy season, dry season, winter, and summer. The time span of the rainy season is filled by rainy weather. The dry season has a time span that goes through with drought. Winter has a time span with constantly low air temperatures. While summer has a time span with always high air temperatures. The earth is composed of key materials that include iron, oxygen, and silicon. Iron is the material with the largest composition for the formation of the Earth's core, which is about 88%. The center of the Earth containing large amounts of iron gives rise to a huge magnetic effect with different poles in the north and south. The location of the magnetic field in the center of the Earth is thousands of kilometers from the surface of the Earth. The distance of the magnetic field far causes the Earth to be blocked from the solar wind. This magnetic field also protects living things from the dangers posed by the Sun's radiation. The existence of a magnetic field causes the rotation of the Earth on its axis while circling the Sun according to its orbit. ", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "The length of time it takes for the Earth to once circle its axis is 23 hours over 56 minutes and 4.09 seconds. This value is generally rounded to 24 hours for easy time calculation. The earth's rotational period on its axis gives rise to day and night time known as one day and one night. Meanwhile, the Earth circles the Sun in its orbit in one turn with a travel time of about 365 days over 5 hours, 48 minutes, and 45.51 seconds. The rotation of the Earth around the Sun is known as the one-year time period. Different types of seasons in each region can form due to the rotation of the Earth around the Sun. The difference in seasons on Earth has to do with the tilt of the Earth's axis of rotation. The angle of position of the Sun towards the equator is formed during the orbiting of the earth towards the sun. This leads to the occurrence of seasonal changes in the northern and southern hemispheres. In addition, the difference in the angle of position of the Sun also forms a difference in the length of time of day and night in the area that moves away from the equatorial plane. The subtropical region experiences four seasons due to the slope in the rotation of the earth on its axis against the path of the earth's displacement towards the Sun. The rotation of the earth that has an oblique angle makes the distant part of the equator experience a near and distant period from the sun for 1/4 of a year. Summer occurs when the subtropical regions experience a period close to the Sun. Winter occurs when the subtropics experience a period away from the Sun. Spring becomes a transition from winter to summer, while autumn becomes a transition from summer to winter. Different seasons are formed in the equatorial region due to the presence of temperature changes in the subtropical region. This change in temperature causes a change in the direction of wind and ocean currents that gives rise to new seasons that are different from the seasons in the subtropical region.

In addition, the Canadian economy became the tenth largest in the world. Natural resources (which are abundant), and international trade networks become the main fulcrum of the country's economy. The long relationship with the United States had a significant impact on the economies and cultures of both countries. Canada is a developed country and has the fifteenth highest nominal per capita income while also ranking tenth highest in the Human Development Index. It is among the highest in the human development index consisting of government transparency, civil liberties, quality of life, economic freedom, and education. Canada is a territory within the Commonwealth of Nations, a member of Francophonie, and part of several international and intergovernmental institutions and groupings including the United Nations, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the G7 (formerly the G8), the Group of Ten, the G20, the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.

Canada has been inhabited by natives (known in Canada as the Canadian Nation) for over 40,000 years. The expedition of the Scandinavians visited him about 1000, briefly staying in the place known as L'Anse aux Meadows. Great Britain's claims to North America began when John Cabot reached what he called \"Newfoundland\" in 1497. French claims begin with the exploration of Jacques Cartier (from 1534), and Samuel de Champlain (from 1603). In 1604, French settlers, who became known as Acadia, were the first Europeans to live permanently in Canada, followed by other French settlements in St. Lawrence, and the Atlantic region of Canada. British settlements stood along the Atlantic coastal areas, and around the Hudson Bay. With the expansion of the French, and British colonies, and the war between France, and Britain in Europe, the French and Indian Wars erupted four times from 1689 to 1763. In the Paris Accords of 1763, France ceded to Great Britain almost all of New France, including Acadia, and what comprises Quebec, and present-day Ontario. Great Britain established the colonies of Nova Scotia, Lower Canada, and Upper Canada. The same new colony with the current legal rights of the Province of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island soon formed. Canadas worked together to formCanada . Cape Breton is combined with Nova Scotia. During, and after the American Revolution, many British Loyalists left the Thirteen Colonies to settle in Canada. Other settlers during this time from the explosion came from Europe, specifically the British Isles.

Angiotensin is a stimulant for the secretion of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex, and is part of the RAA system (renin-angiotensin-aldosterone). The precursor of angiotensin is an angiotensinogen secreted by the liver, which will turn into angiotensin I and by the enzyme \"Angiotensin Convertizing Enzyme\" will be converted into Angiotensi II. Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe-His-Leu | Val-Ile-... Angiotensin I (CAS # 11128-99-7) or proangiotensin is formed by the action of renin against angiotensinogen. Renin splits the peptide bond between leucine (Leu) and valina (Val) residues in angiotensinogen, and forms a decapeptida (peptide ten amino acids long) (desp-Asp) angiotensin 1. Renin is produced by the kidneys in response to sympathetic nervous activity, a decrease in intrarenal blood pressure (<90mmHg systolic) in juxtaglomerular cells, or a decrease in the delivery of Na\u207a (sodium ions) and Cl\u207b (chloride ions) to the macular densa. If a decrease in NaCl concentration is detected by the macular densa, renin secretion by juxtaglomerular cells is enhanced. The detection mechanism by macula densa renin secretion seems to be specific dependent on chloride ions and not sodium ions. Studies using isolation preparations from Henle arch thick ascendent channels with glomerulus in low NaCl perfusion were not able to inhibit renin secretion when many types of sodium salts were added, but could block renin secretion when chloride salts were added. These and other similar studies in vivo have led some to believe that perhaps \"the first signal for the control of renin secretion MD is a change in the absorption rate of NaCl mainly through the Na,K,2Cl co-transporter inside the lumen, whose physiological activity is established by changes in chloride concentrations within the lumen\". Angiotensin I does not appear to have direct biological activity against body cells and organs, and is only used as a precursor to angiotensin II. ", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe Angiotensin I was converted to angiotensin II (AII) through the removal of two C end residues (C-terminal) by the angiotensin-converting (ACE) enzyme. ACE is a type of enzyme that is widely found in the vessels of the pulmonary capillaries (but can also be found in endothelial cells, epithelial cells of the kidneys and brain). ACE splits angiotensin I on the His-Leu chain into angiotensin II. Angiotensin II affects the central nervous system (CNS) to increase vasopressin production, and also affects smooth muscle veins and arterioles to result in vasocontriction. Angiontensin II also increases the secretion of aldosterone, due to which angiotensin II functions as an endocrine, autocrine, paracrine and intracrine hormone. ACE is a target of ace enzyme inhibitor drugs, which reduce the production levels of angiotensin II. Angiontensin II increases blood pressure by stimulating the Gq protein inside vascular smooth muscle cells, which further activates IP3-dependent mechanisms and increases intracellular calcium levels and causes contractions. When a cardiac cell is stimulated, an RA system is activated within the cardiac myocytes and stimulates the development of that cardiac cell with protein kinase C. The same system is also activated in smooth muscle cells, in the event of hypertension, atheroscerosis and damage to the endothelial layer. When hypertrophic occurs, angiotensin II is also the most important stimulator of Gq, compared to endothelin-1 and adreno A1 absorbers. Angiotensin II is also a prothrombin stimulant through the adhesion and aggregation of blood chips and the production of PAI-1 and PAI-2. In the adrenal glands, this hormone causes the secretion of the hormone aldosterone. Angiotensin II affects Na\u207a/H\u207a exchangers residing in the proximal tubules in the kidneys and stimulates the reabsorption of sodium ions and the excision of hydrogen ions coupled with bicarbonate reabsorption. This process results in an increase in blood volume, pressure and pH. Therefore, ACE inhibitors are the main anti-hypertensive drugs.

The first person known to write the letter G was Spurius Carvilius Ruga, the first Roman to open a paid school, and taught around 230 BC. At that time, the letter K was less used, while the letter C, which initially represented the sounds /\u0261/ and /k/ before the vowel sound, then only represented the sound /k/ in each position. The placement of G by Ruga suggests that the alphabetical arrangement, which relates to the value of that letter as a Greek number, attracted attention in the 3rd century BC. Sampson (1985) argues that: \"It is obvious that the arrangement of the alphabet is perceived as such a concrete matter that a new letter may be added in the middle of the arrangement only if there is a 'room' after shifting the old letter.\" According to some accounts, the previous seventh letter, namely Z, was removed from the Latin alphabet at the beginning of the 3rd century BC by a Roman censor, Appius Claudius, who felt the letter was foreign and unimportant. Not long after, both back palate consonants /k/ and /\u0261/ undergo palatalization and asophone processes before the vowels in front; therefore, the letters C and G have different sound values in the Romance language family, as well as English (due to the influence of French). The lowercase g has two different basic forms: \"open-tailed g\" and \"circular tailed g\". ", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "The present-day lowercase \u2039g\u203a has two typographic variations: an open tail () and a circular tail (). The open tail version derives from the capital letter form G by raising the serif that distinguishes it from the letter C, thus closing the arch C like an inverted letter D (\u2c6d), then adding a vertical line from the bottom curved to the left. The circular tail version also occurs because of something similar, with variations occurring so that the left arch returns to the right and then back to the left again so that a circle occurs. The circular tail version is commonly used in the Roman typeface and is popularly used when printing using the Roman typeface because the circular tail shape tends to be shorter so that the gap between the lines is not too wide. In the circular tail version of the letter G, the small line to the top right, like a sticking out finish line, is called an ear. Non-Romance languages usually use \u2039g\u203a to represent the sound /\u0261/ regardless of position. Among European languages, Dutch is an exception because it does not contain the /\u0261/ sound in its original vocabulary, instead \u2039g\u203a symbolizes the sound of the voiced back ceiling hissing consonant (IPA: /\u0263/), a sound that does not exist in Modern English. The Faroese language uses \u2039g\u203a to symbolize /d\u0292/, in addition to /g/, and also uses it to indicate semivocal sounds. The soft value of the pronunciation \u2039g\u203a varies in the Romance language family: In those language families, except for Italian and Romanian, the pronunciation of \"soft G\" is the same as the pronunciation of the letter J in the language in question. In English, the letter G can symbolize: In some English words of French origin, \"soft G\" is pronounced as a hissing consonant (/\u0292/), as in the words rouge, beige, and genre. In general, \u2039g\u203a is pronounced softly before \u2039e\u203a, \u2039i\u203a, and \u2039y\u203a in words of Romance origin, in addition to using \"hard G\"; there are many English vocabularies that are not derived from Romance that use a \"hard G\" without disregarding position (e.g. get), and three words (gaol, margarine, algae) that are pronounced softly before the vowel \u2039a\u203a.

Apoptosis is used by multicellular organisms to remove cells that are no longer needed by the body. Apoptosis is different from necrosis and pyroptosis. Apoptosis generally lasts a lifetime and is beneficial to the body, while necrosis is cell death caused by acute cell damage; and proptosis is a programmed cell death that occurs in intracellular pathogenic infections and gives rise to inflammation. A vivid example of the advantages of apoptosis is the separation of fingers in embryos. Apoptosis experienced by cells located between the fingers causes each finger to become separate from each other. If a cell loses the ability to perform apoptosis then it can divide indefinitely and eventually become cancerous. Apoptosis has distinctive morphological features such as blistering plasma membranes, shriveled cells, chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation, and starting with the cassate enzyme from the cysteine protease group forms a multi-sub-unit protease activation complex called apoptosome. Apoptosomes are synthesized inside the cytoplasm after an increase in the permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane and the release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm, after an interaction occurs between the double membrane of mitochondrial sardiolipin and anionic phospholipids that trigger peroxidase activity. Apoptosomes are protein complexes consisting of cytochrome c, apaf-1, and prokaspase-9. In addition to cytochrome c, mitochondria also release other apoptotic proteins such as apoptosis Inducing Factor, endonuclease G, Omi, and Smac/Diablo. In an adult organism, the number of cells in an organ or tissue must be constant at a certain range. Blood and skin cells, for example, are always renewed by self-division of their progenitor cells, but such self-division must be compensated by the death of old cells.

Ursus comes from the Latin ursus meaning bear, and idae comes from the ancient Greek Eidos (Greek: \u03b5\u1f36\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2). Pregnancy in bears usually lasts 6\u20139 months, including delayed implantation, and can conceive up to four children at a time. Giant pandas can give birth to twins but they can only breastfeed one child and the other is left to die. In bear species living in the north, births occur during winter dormancy. The cubs are born blind and helpless with at most a thin layer of hair, relying on their mother for warmth. The milk of the female bear is rich in fat and antibodies and the cubs can suckle up to a year after they are born. At 2-3 months, bear cubs can already walk and follow their mother outside the nest. They usually follow her on foot, but bear cubs ride on their mother's back more often. Bears have an accomplished sense of smell and hearing, round-eared, small-tailed, long-haired, dense and coarse, They have wide paws and number five on the irretractable palm.

This change also results in changes in its anatomy. The organs that make up the tubers are mainly stems, roots, or their modifications. Only a few groups of plants form bulbs by involving their leaves. Tubers usually form just below ground level, although they can also form deep and above the surface. Anatomical and morphological changes can be viewed as a consequence of the modification of organ function. From an evolutionary point of view, the tuber is not only a storage organ for energy reserves, but also a means of survival survival and producing offspring in a growing environment that endangers its life. Because of this, tubers usually store excess energy reserves, generally in the form of high-energy compounds, such as carbohydrates. Thus, the vital role of tubers is as an energy storage organ, survival tool, and vegetative propagation tool. By humans, some grassy plants are deliberately grown as food, mainly because of their nutritional content. Tubers store starch, sugar, and various secondary metabolites that can be of nutritional value or medicinal properties to humans or harmful to the body when eaten. Tubers are distinguished by modified basic organs. The Latin term for a tuber formed from a stem and root is a tuber, which means \"swelling\". Ordinary people usually refer to any part of the plant that is \"swollen\" and contains carbohydrates (starch) as a tuber. Some special forms can have different names. It should be noted that modifications of the stems and leaves as a place for storing food in the form of lapis tubers (bulbus) are often botanically distinguished from other forms of tubers. A root tuber (Latin: tuber rhizogenum, English: tuberous root) is a tuber formed from a root.

Judging from the origin, root tubers can be formed from taproot, such as carrot or radish tubers, as well as from branch roots, such as tree/cassava boiler tubers, vine/sweet potato kettles, taro tubers, and arrowroot. A stem tuber (Latin: tuber cauligenum) is a tuber formed from a stem or stem modification structure, such as a geragih (stolo) or rhizome (rhizoma). Stem tubers are able to give rise to buds and roots, so they are often used as vegetative propagation material by humans. Stem tubers are produced by several species of Solanaceae (the best known are potato tubers) and Asteraceae (such as dahlia tubers and topinambur). The rhizome of ginger-ginger (Zingiberaceae) is often perceived by the layman as a \"tuber\" or \"root\". A lapis tuber (bulbus) is a type of tuber formed from a pile (base) of leaves densely arranged in a rosette format. Lapis tubers are seen as different from other tubers in that they do not accumulate carbohydrates in the form of polysaccharides. Enlargement occurs due to the gathering of fluid in its cells. This type of bulb is formed by several monocotyledonous tribes such as Amaryllidaceae (broad meaning, including the onion group) and Liliaceae. Lapis tubers have a rather hard base part called a discus (discus). This disc is actually a rod. From the disc will grow thick, soft, juicy layers of leaves. It is because of this thickness and layering that a swollen structure is formed so that it is called a \"tuber\". When these layers are large and cover each other it is called tunica, and when these layers are small and only absorb each other it is called squama (scales). Pee tubers are almost the same as a type of tuber of stem origin known as cormus or bulbotuber. Judging by the structure, lapis tubers differ from cormus.

Arkelaus accepted the kingdom of Judea by his father's last will, although it would previously be bequeathed to his brother Antipas. He was proclaimed king by the army, but refused to accept the title until he made a claim to Emperor Augustus in Rome. Before leaving, he ruthlessly overcame the incitement of the Pharisees by slaughtering nearly three thousand of them. In Rome he was opposed by Antipas and by many Jews, who feared his atrocities, but in 4 BC Augustus allocated to him most of the kingdoms (Samaria, Judea, and Idumea) with the title etnarkh until 6 AD when Judea was made a fiefdom directly under Roman rule.

Josephus began his narration in the early days of Arkhelaus' reign before Easter in 4 BC. Arkhelaus dressed in white and occupying the throne of gold performed cordially against the inhabitants of Jerusalem to appease their demands that taxes be lowered and enemies imprisoned at the time of Herod the Great be released.

There are various theories regarding the origin of synagogues, which are as follows. Jewish tradition of mentioning synagogue roots dates back to the time of Moses, or even in the days of the Israelite patriarchs. Flavius Josephus and Philo state that the synagogue was founded by Moses as a place where Jews listened to the Torah once a week. Targum Onkelos declared Jacob to be the minister of the synagogue (Gen. 25:27), while Targum Jonathan said that Jethro invited Moses to teach the Israelites about the prayers to be offered in their synagogues. Then Targum Chronicles interpreted the sacrificial hill in Gibeon as a synagogue. There is a theory from Julian Morgenstern that synagogues began to stand in Israel as a result of Josiah's Reformation, when the altars and sacrificial hills of the non-Jewish religious tradition were destroyed.

Moss posits the opinion that synagogues existed before the time of the Exile to Babylonia of the 6th century BC. He stated that at first the synagogue was a school and a local government agency before it developed into a worship center during the Exile period. There are some scholars who state the origin of synagogues in the Maccabees or after the inhibition of the Maccabees. It is based on archaeological evidence that as of the 3rd century, synagogues were not yet known in Palestine. Archaeological evidence suggests the oldest synagogue whose relics were found in Palestine dates back to the 1st century AD. However, this theory is weak because the Maccabee rebellion seems to be closely related to the synagogue, where it is said that copies of the Torah were captured and burned by the enemy, thus proving that the synagogue existed before the Maccabees' rebellion. Most scholars support the opinion that the first synagogue stood in exile in Babylon as early as the 5th century BC. The arguments of scholars are based on the distance of the Jews from the Temple which was the center of their worship, even though they needed to maintain their faith identity in Babylon which was a foreign place. Because of this, the Jews began to gather in their own homes and discuss Scripture regularly, as well as perform sacrificial celebrations and other celebrations in certain places and that is what eventually became the origin of the synagogue. This argument is supported by the fact that hope of returning to the Palestinian homeland is still maintained among Jews despite decades of exile.

If the married couple is tired, Sora's ox provides his stomach as a seating mat. If crossing the marshes, Sora's ox provides for carrying Tribhuwana. Raden Wijaya then allied with Arya Wiraraja to bring down Jayakatwang. When Raden Wijaya left for Kadiri pretending to surrender to Jayakatwang, Tribhuwana was left in Sumenep. It wasn't until Raden Wijaya got the Terik forest to be opened into Majapahit village, Tribhuwana came with Ranggalawe, the son of Arya Wiraraja. This news is contained in the Song of Panji Wijayakarama. In 1293 the Mongols came to help Raden Wijaya defeat Jayakatwang. According to Pararaton, the Mongol king was willing to help because Arya Wiraraja promised Tribhuwana and Gayatri as gifts. The story is only the imagination of the author of Pararaton, because according to the Chinese chronicles of the Yuan Dynasty, the sending of the Mongol army led by Ike Mese was solely to conquer Kertanagara, not at the invitation of Arya Wiraraja.

According to Sanghyang Siksa Kandang Karesian pupuh XVII, kujang is the weapon of the peasants and has roots in the agricultural culture of the Sundanese people.

The word Hyang also comes from the Old Sundanese language which means god/goddess. Other sources state that Kujang comes from the word Ujang, which means human.

As a symbol or symbol with philosophical values contained in it, Kujang is used as one of the aesthetics in several emblems of organization and government. In addition, Kujang is also used as a name for various organizations, units and of course also used by the West Java Provincial Government. In the past, Kujang could not be separated from the life of the Sundanese people because of its function as agricultural equipment.

From an agricultural utensil, the kujang develops into an object that has its own character and tends to be a weapon of symbolic and sacred value. The new form of kujang as we know it today is thought to have been born between the 9th and 12th centuries.

Apart from its unique shape, kujang raw materials tend to be thin, dry, porous and contain many natural metal elements. Kujang has a variety of functions and forms. Based on function, kujang is divided into four, including: Kujang Pusaka (symbol of majesty and protection), Kujang Pangarak (for war), Kujang Pakarang (as a ceremonial tool) and Kujang Pamangkas (as a tool for farming).

Its bases include Brahmanism (Ancient Vedic religion), religions of the Indus River basin civilization, and popular local traditions. The synthesis arose around 500\u2013200 BC, and grew side by side with Buddhism until the 8th century. From North India, the \"Hindu Synthesis\" spread to the south, to parts of Southeast Asia. It was supported by Sanskritisasi. Since the 19th century, under the dominance of Western colonialism and Indology (when the term \"Hinduism\" came into widespread use), Hinduism was reaffirmed as a gathering place for a variety of coherent and independent traditions.

Finally, 'Hindu' became the equivalent term for 'Indians' who were not Muslims, Sikhs, Jaina, or Christians, thus encompassing a variety of adherents and executors of different traditional beliefs.

The term armor is synonymous with protective clothing for fighting in ancient times, although in modern times the police and soldiers also used lighter and more flexible armor. In its development, armor evolved from merely thick leather-based clothing (e.g. pangolin skin), then body-shaped metal slabs (e.g. quiras), to the most advanced bulletproof vests. Nowadays, what is considered a suit of armor is generally armor. The well-known division of types of armor is armor from the braid of chains (chain armor), scale-shaped (scaled armor), and solid slabs (plate armor). Armor is also used in the archipelago. However, not all soldiers wear armor. Armor was generally worn by richer or high-ranking kings, nobles, and warriors.

The length of these crustaceans is from 2 to 4 mm (0.079-0.157 inches), with an elongated body. They have a large head, the back end of which covers the first thoracic segment.

Like other surviving monotremata, the short-snouted Echidna lays eggs; Monotremata are the only mammalia group that can do so.

The short-snouted echidna was first described by George Shaw in 1792. He named this species Myrmecophaga aculeata, because he thought it was related to South American ant eaters. Since Shaw first described the species, his name has undergone four revisions from M. aculeata to Ornithorhynchus hystrix, Echidna hystrix, Echidna aculeata and finally Tachyglossus aculeatus.

The name of this procedure has been used since the Middle Ages in Europe and is one of the most important ways of calculating the calendar. The main formula is that Easter falls on the first Sunday after the fourteenth day of the kamariyah month (the first full) which falls on or after March 21 (i.e. the date of the ecclesiastical Sun's Spring point). To account for the date of the celebration of Easter, the Christian church uses the \"ecclesiastical\" full moon day instead of the \"astronomical\" full moon. The Eastern Orthodox Church uses March 21 according to the Julian Calendar, while the Roman Catholic Church uses March 21 according to the more modern and more widely used Gregorian Calendar. Thus the full moon of the eastern church usually falls 4-5 days after the full moon of the western church. This method came into use after the reform of the Gregorian calendar of 1582. How it works is described by Clavius in the book \"Six Canons\" (1582), and his full explanation in his book \"Explicatio\" (1603). Easter Sunday is the Sunday after the Full Easter date. The Easter Full Date (TPP) is an ecclesiastical full moon after March 20 and the date can be seen in the following table: Easter Full Date (TPP) for 300 years: 1900-2199 AD (M=March A=April) For example: 2010 AD divided by 19 remaining 15. The TPP is March 30, 2010, on Tuesday. Easter Sunday is the following Sunday, which is April 4th. The Gregorian calendar discards three leap days in a 400-year cycle (always in a century year). This is the calendar's way of correcting its calculations according to the length of the solar year. The ecclesiastical full date calculation method was the standard calendar calculation before the Gregorian calendar reform, and the old method is still used by most Orthodox churches. ", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "Since there is no correction as in the Gregorian calendar, the ecclesiastical full of the Julian calendar every century shifts over 3 days to the astronomical full, as a result of which the Eastern Orthodox church celebrates Easter about a week after the Catholic and Christian churches. Often Orthodox Easter is celebrated 4-5 weeks later because March 20 of the Julian calendar is 13 days later than March 20 of the Gregorian calendar in the period 1900-2099. Here's a table of Easter Full dates for all Julian years since 326 AD: (M=March, A=April) Easter is the first Sunday after the date indicated. So for every ecclesiastical full, there are seven possible Easter dates. The seven-day cycle does not repeat, because there is a leap year every 4 years, the cycle repeats every 4x7=28 years, which is called the shamsiah cycle. Thus the cycle of Easter dates repeats every 28x19=532 years. The Easter cycle is also called the Viktorius Cycle according to Viktorius of Aquitaine who introduced it to Rome in 457. It was first known to be used by Annianus of Alexandria in the early 5th century. Sometimes the cycle is also called the cycle of Dionysius according to Dionysius Exiguus who made the Passover tables beginning in 532; but apparently he did not realize that the Alexandrian computus he described had a cycle of 532 years, although he realized that the 95-year table was not his true cycle. It was Venerabilis Bede (7th century) apparently who first observed the shamsiah cycle and explained the relationship between the Shamsiah cycle and the Easter cycle.

With 10,084 inhabitants in an area of 21 square kilometers (8.1 sq mi), Nauru is the smallest country in the South Pacific and the third smallest state by region in the world, just behind Vatican City and Monaco. Inhabited by people from Micronesia and Polynesia around 1000 BC, Nauru was annexed and claimed as a colony by the German Empire in the late 19th century.

It has its roots as an organized religion in the Middle East during the Bronze Age. Some scholars argue that modern Judaism evolved from Yahism, the religion of ancient Israel and Judah, in the late 6th century BC, and is thus considered one of the oldest monotheistic religions. Judaism is considered by Jewish religionists to be an expression of the covenant God made with the Israelites, their ancestors. It includes many texts, practices, theological positions, and organizational forms. The Torah, as commonly understood by Jews, is part of a larger text known as the \"Tanakh\". The \"Tanakh\" is also known to secular religious scholars as the Hebrew Bible, and to Christians as the \"Old Testament\". Additional oral traditions of the Torah are represented by later texts such as the Midrash and Talmud. The Hebrew word \"torah\" can mean \"doctrine\", \"law\", or \"instruction\", although \"Torah\" can also be used as a general term referring to any Jewish text that extends or describes the original Five Books of Moses. Representing the core of the Jewish spiritual and religious tradition, Torah is a term and set of teachings that explicitly positions itself as encompassing at least seventy, and potentially infinite, aspects and interpretations. The texts, traditions, and values of Judaism greatly influenced later Abrahamic religions, including Christianity and Islam. Hebraism, like Hellenism, played an important role in the formation of Western civilization through its impact as a core background element of Early Christianity. In Judaism, there are various religious movements, most of which arise from Rabbinic Judaism, which states that God revealed His laws and commandments to Moses on Mount Sinai in the form of a Written and Oral Torah.

Some branches of modern Judaism such as Humanistic Judaism can be considered secular or nontheistic. Today, the largest Jewish religious movements are Orthodox Judaism (Haredi Judaism and Modern Orthodox Judaism), Conservative Judaism, and Reformed Judaism. The main sources of difference between these groups are their approach to halakha (Jewish law), the authority of rabbinic traditions, and the significance of the State of Israel. Orthodox Judaism states that the Torah and halakha are of divine origin, eternal and irreversible, and that they must be strictly followed. Conservative Judaism and Reformation are more liberal, with Conservative Judaism generally promoting a more traditionalist interpretation of the requirements of Judaism than Reformed Judaism. The typical Reformation position was that halakha should be seen as a general set of guidelines rather than as a set of restrictions and obligations that all Jews should abide by. Historically, special courts imposed halakha; today, these courts still exist but the practice of Judaism is largely voluntary. Authority in theological and legal matters is not held by one person or organization, but in sacred and rabbinic texts and the scholars who interpret them. Jews are an ethnoreligious group including those born Jews (or \"ethnic Jews\"), in addition to those who converted to Judaism. In 2019, the world's Jewish population was estimated to be around 14.7 million, or about 0.19% of the world's total population. About 46.9% of all Jews live in Israel and another 38.8% live in the United States and Canada, with most of the rest living in Europe, and other minority groups spread throughout Latin America, Asia, Africa, and Australia.

Meanwhile, the meaning of Invention and Inventor (contained in the above sense, is): The word patent, derived from the English word patent, which originally came from the word patere which means to open up (for public examination), and also comes from the term letters patent, which is a decree issued by the kingdom that grants exclusive rights to certain individuals and business people. From the definition of the word patent itself, the concept of patent encourages inventors to open knowledge for the betterment of society and in return, inventors get exclusive rights for a certain period. Given that the granting of patents does not regulate who must carry out patented inventions, the patent system is not considered a monopoly right. There are currently several international treaties governing patent law. Among other things, the WTO Treaty TRIPs are followed by almost all countries. The granting of patent rights is territorial, that is, binding only within a specific location. Thus, in order to obtain patent protection in some country or region, one must file a patent application in each of those countries or regions. For the European region, one can submit one patent application to the European Patent Office, which if successful, the applicant will get multiple patents (up to 36 patents, each for each country in Europe), instead of one patent valid throughout the European region.

Software that implements algorithms is also not patentable unless there is a practical application (in the United States) or technical effects (in Europe).

The United States in some legal cases there, allows patents for software and business methods, while in Europe, software is considered non-patentable, although some inventions that use software are still patentable. Patents can relate to natural substances (e.g. substances found in jungles) as well as medicines, medical treatment techniques and also genetic sequences, as well as controversial subjects. In different countries, there are differences in dealing with subjects related to this. For example, in the United States, surgical methods can be patented, but these patents are subject to opposition in practice. Given that according to the principle of the Hippocratic Oath (Hippocratic Oath), the doctor is obliged to share his experience and expertise freely with his colleagues. So in 1994, The American Medical Association (AMA) House of Delegates filed a memorandum of objection to this patent application. In Indonesia, the terms of the findings to be patented are new (have never been disclosed before), contain inventive steps (unforeseeable), and can be applied in industry. The protection period for 'ordinary' patents is 20 years, while simple patents are 10 years. Patents cannot be renewed. In order to ensure that the technology under study has not been patented by other parties and is worthy of patenting, it can be traced to patent documents. There are some special cases of inventions that are not allowed to receive patent protection, namely processes / products whose implementation is contrary to law, religious morality, public order or decency; methods of examination, treatment, treatment and/or surgery applied to humans and/or animals; and theories and methods in mathematics and science, i.e. all living things, except bodies, and biological processes essential to the production of plants or animals, except non-biological processes or micro-biological processes.

The virus itself is called Human Immunodeficiency Virus (or HIV for short), which is a virus that weakens immunity in the human body. People who get this virus will become susceptible to opportunistic infections or easily get tumors. Although existing treatments can slow the rate of development of the virus, this disease has not really been cured. HIV and similar viruses are generally transmitted through direct contact between the inner skin layer (mucous membrane) or bloodstream, with HIV-containing body fluids, such as blood, semen, vaginal fluids, preseminal fluids, and breast milk. Transmission can occur through intercourse (vaginal, anal, or oral), blood transfusions, contaminated syringes, between mother and baby during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding, as well as other forms of contact with these body fluids. Scientists generally argue that AIDS originated in Sub-Saharan Africa. Now AIDS has become a plague. AIDS is thought to have infected 38.6 million people worldwide.

Sometimes such social punishments are also imposed on health workers or volunteers, who are involved in caring for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV). Various AIDS symptoms will generally not occur in people who have a good immune system. Most of these conditions result from infection by bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites, which are usually controlled by elements of the immune system that HIV damages. Opportunistic infections are common in people with AIDS. HIV affects almost all organs of the body. People with AIDS are also at greater risk of suffering from cancers such as Kaposi's sarcoma, cervical cancer, and an immune system cancer called lymphoma. Usually people with AIDS have symptoms of systemic infection; such as fever, sweating (especially at night), swelling of the glands, chills, feeling weak, as well as weight loss. Certain opportunistic infections suffered by AIDS patients, also depend on the degree of frequency with which such infections occur in the geographical area where the patient lives.

In general, women have menstruation for 6 - 8 days and at most 15 days. A woman who experiences istihadhah is forbidden to leave her worship, such as prayer, fasting and other worship services. In terms, there are several definitions among scholars. However, it can probably be concluded as follows: Istihadhah is blood that comes from a vein that breaks/breaks and comes out not during menstruation or puerperium (mostly), but sometimes also comes out during the menstrual tradition and during puerperium. Since he was the blood of illness, then he would not stop flowing until the woman was cured of him. For this reason, the blood of this istihadhah sometimes never stops coming out at all and sometimes it stops only a day or two a month. Unlike menstrual blood, istihadhah blood has the following characteristics: It is red, smells like ordinary blood, comes from a vein that breaks/breaks and when it comes out it immediately thickens. There is another difference in the nature of menstrual blood when compared to the blood of istihadlah: The priests of the four schools differ in opinion regarding women who bleed istihadhah. According to the Hanafi School, women with regular menstrual periods should follow their menstrual habits to determine the early period of istihadhah. In women who do not have regular menstrual habits, blood differences are not used as a reference. The guidelines used are the shortest menstrual period. The Maliki School stipulates that the early days of istihadhah should be based on blood differences and not on menstrual habits.

If you are unable to distinguish, then menstrual habits are used as guidelines. If women do not have menstrual habits and are unable to distinguish the two types of blood, then the law is the same as for women who experience early menstruation. The Hambali School argues that women who have menstrual habits and are able to distinguish the two types of blood, then the difference in blood is used as a guideline. In the condition of not having menstrual habits and not being able to distinguish the type of blood, the Hambali School has two opinions. The first opinion is to make the shortest menstrual period a guideline. Meanwhile, the second opinion is to make the menstrual habits of other women a guideline. This habit is generally between six to seven days. Istihadhah is an uncertain event. This is not a barrier for Muslim women to practice their worship every day. Women who experience istihadhah should continue to practice prayers, fasting and other services.

By the end of the century, retention in Anglicanism over many of its traditional liturgical systems and over its episcopate was unacceptable to those who promoted the latest principles of Protestantism. In the first half of the 17th century, the Church of England and the Church of Ireland associated with it were presented by several Anglican clergy as the scope of a distinct Christian tradition, with various theologies, structures, and systems of worship representing one type of middle ground or via different media between Protestantism and Roman Catholicism. This perspective became very influential in later Anglican theories of identity and is expressed in the description of Anglicanism as \"Catholic and Reformed.\" The degree of difference between Protestant and Catholic tendencies within the Anglican tradition is the subject of regular debate both within certain Anglican churches and throughout the Anglican Communion. A peculiarity of Anglicanism is the Book of Common Prayer, a collection of worship systems used in most Anglican churches over the centuries, and thus recognized as one of the ties that binds Anglican Communion together. After the American Revolution, Anglican congregations in the United States and British North America (which would later form the basis for the modern state of Canada) were reshaped into autonomous churches with their own self-managed structures and bishops, namely the Episcopal Church of the United States and the Anglican Church of Canada.

If the number of amino acids is still below 50 molecules it is called peptides, but if it is more than 50 molecules it is called a protein. Amino acids bind to peptide bonds with each other. Peptide bonds occur if the nitrogen atom of one of the amino acids binds to the carboxyl group of another amino acid. An example of a peptide formed from alanine and glycine is alaniglycine, where the naming describes the formation of a peptide bond. Peptides are found in every living thing and play a role in several biochemical activities. Peptides can be enzymes, hormones, antibiotics and receptors. Peptide synthesis is carried out by combining the carboxyl group of one amino acid with the amine group of another amino acid. Peptide synthesis starts from the C-terminus (carboxyl group) to the N-terminus (amine group), as it occurs naturally in organisms. However, to synthesize peptides, it is not as easy as mixing amino acids just like that. For example: mixing glutamine (E) and serine (S) can produce E-S, S-E, S-S, E-E, and even polypeptides such as E-S-S-E-E. In order to avoid amino acids from binding uncontrollably, it is necessary to carry out protection and control of peptide bonds that will occur so that the bonds formed are as desired. The steps of peptide synthesis are as follows: amino acids are added protective groups. Then the protected amino acids are dissolved in a solvent such as dimetyhlformamide (DMF) which is coupled with coupling reagents pumped through a synthesis column. The protection group is removed from amino acids through a deprotection reaction. Then the deprotection reagent is removed to create a clean combining atmosphere. Coupling reagents, e.g. N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCI), help the formation of peptide bonds. After the coupling reaction is formed, the coupling reagents are washed to create a clean deprotection atmosphere. ", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "E is the fifth Latin letter.

The definitions of Kabbalah vary according to their respective traditions and indicate who followed them, from their mid-Jewish origins to later adaptations in Western Esotericism (Christian Kabbalah and Hermetic Kabbalah). The Jewish Kabbalah is a set of teachings that seek to expose mystical notions veiled in the Tanakh (Hebrew Scriptures). Kabala offers a mystical understanding into the Immutable, Forever, and Mysterious Divine essence of Ein Sof (\u05d0\u05b5\u05d9\u05df \u05e1\u05d5\u05b9\u05e3, \"The Infinite One\") and living beings (who can die), the finite universe (Genesis narrative of creation). This formed the main foundation of the mystical interpretation of religion in the Jewish religion. The Kabbalah Jews actually created their own transmission of the Scriptures that are within the Jewish tradition and demonstrate from its mystical teachings. These teachings are firmly held by the Kabbalists or Mequbbal to define from the deepest intentions between the Hebrew Gospels and traditional rabbinic literature and the previously hidden dimension, just as it explains the importance of obedience from the Jewish religion. Traditional practitioners believe from the origins of the earliest world religions, the formation of primordial planning for the Creator's philosophy, religions, science, art, and political systems. Historically, Kabbalah emerged from early forms of Jewish mysticism, in the 12th to 13th centuries in Spain and Southern France, and reinterpreted during the renaissance of Jewish mysticism in the 16th century Usmaniyah Palestine. Zohar, the central foundation of the text of Kabbalah, was conceived in the last 13th century.

In the 20th century, academic interest in Kabbalah texts was led primarily by the Jewish historian Gershom Scholem who had inspired the formation of historical research in Kabbalah in the field of Jewish studies. The term \"Kabala\" was originally used in Talmudic texts, among the Geonyms (early medieval rabbis) and by the Rishonim (later medieval rabbis) as a reference to a complete collection of oral traditions of Jewish teachings, which are publicly available. Even the works of the prophets were referred to as Kabala, before they were canonized as part of the oral tradition. In this sense Kabala is used in referring to all the oral laws of Judaism. After a while, this oral law was recorded, but its esoteric teachings remained as an oral tradition. Thus, esoteric teachings remain an oral tradition. Thus, the term is then related to the doctrines of esoteric knowledge of God, the creation of God's universe and the laws of nature, the reasons for the commandments in the Torah and the ways in which God governs the existence of the universe. Today even the esoteric teachings of the Torah are recorded, but they are still known as Kabala. According to Jewish tradition Kabala dates back to Adam, although modern liberal rabbis take into account its origins in the 13th century. This knowledge is passed down as a revelation to select saints from the distant past, and for the most part, is preserved only by a handful of lucky people. The proper protocol for teaching this wisdom, as well as many of its concepts, is recorded in the Talmud (the second chapter of the Hagggiga tract). It is considered part of Jewish oral law by most pious Jews in modern times, although this is not approved by many modern liberal rabbis and a minority of Orthodox rabbis.

The company has a number of patents that are important for 5G, 4G, CDMA2000, TD-SCDMA, and WCDMA mobile communication standards. Qualcomm was founded in 1985 by Irwin M. Jacobs and six others. Qualcomm's initial research into CDMA wireless phone technology was funded by selling a two-way digital satellite communication system called Omnitracs. After a number of heated debates in the wireless industry, the 2G standard was finally adopted with a CDMA patent from Qualcomm included. Then there was a series of legal disputes over the price of the patent license required by the standard. Gradually, Qualcomm expanded to sell semiconductor products, especially with a nonfabricated manufacturing model. The company also develops semiconductor components or software for vehicles, watches, laptops, Wi-Fi, smartphones and other devices. Qualcomm was formed in July 1985 by seven former Linkabit employees led by Irwin Jacobs. The company is named Qualcomm which stands for \"QUALity COMMunications.\" The company began its history as a contract-based research and development center, primarily for government and defense projects. In 1988, Qualcomm merged with Omninet and secured $3.5 million in funding to manufacture the Omnitracs satellite communications system for truck operators. Qualcomm grew from employing only 8 people in 1986 to 620 in 1991, in order to meet the demand for Omnitracs.

In addition, kebaya is also worn in areas outside Southeast Asia, namely the use by Javanese, Malays and Portuguese Eurasians in the Cocos Islands, Natal Island, coastal India and Sri Lanka, Macau and South Africa. Kebaya is an upper garment that has the characteristic of being exposed on the front and is traditionally made from light fabrics such as brocade, cotton, gauze, lace, or voile, and is sometimes decorated with embroidery. The front is secured with buttons, pins or brooches. While the bottom garment for this garment is usually known as a sarong, kemben or a long piece of cloth wrapped around the waist and can be batik, ikat, songket or weaving Kebaya is officially recognized as a national garment and also an icon of Indonesian fashion, although the use of kebaya is only worn by Javanese, Sundanese and Balinese people periodically.

", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "The term was later introduced to the Archipelago through the Portuguese word cabaya. It is very likely that the origin of kebaya originated in the Middle East due to the composition of its cultural roots. This is evidenced by the connection of kebaya with qaba from Arabia which is a kind of long slack robe proposed by orientalists Henry Yule and Arthur Burnell in 1886. Clothes from Arab lands have indeed been known since the 7th century AD, some historical traces even show that the Islamic Prophet Muhammad received a gift in the form of aqbiya (which is the plural of qaba) in some instances. Many experts argue that the Persians are the main origins of qaba. In addition, with the spread of Islam through the process of trade and so on, this kind of fashion is no longer found only in Arab lands, but also in Persian, Turkish, and Urdu lands. Due to its physical form, many sources state that kebaya comes from Muslim clothing named as qaba, habaya, al akibiya al turkiyya and djubba. The claim that kebaya probably originated in the Arab World is very likely, as Islam penetrated into the Malay World in the 15th century AD and Malay women began to follow Islamic dress norms. Before the existence of Islam, the female population did wear clothes with fewer strands due to humidity and the hot climate and the pre-Islamic religion in the Malay lands did not forbid such a thing. A detailed description of the cabaya can be seen in the 19th century Hobson-Jobson dictionary. In addition, in the Anglo-Indian dictionary, cabaya is a word with Asian origins and means a covering strand of a long tunic worn by upper-class Indians.

Philological and linguistic evidence suggests that most of the Samhita Regweda was made in the northwest of the Indian subcontinent likely between ca. 1500 and 1000 BC, although there are broader estimates, ca. 1900 \u2013 1200 BC.note 1] The Regweda consists of Samhita, Brahmins, Aranyaka, and Upanisads.note 3] Samhita is the core of the text, and consists of 10 books (mandalas) with 1,028 s\u016bktas in the sum of 10,600 verses (called \u1e5bc, eponymous of the name Regweda).

The later books 1 and 10 are made to contain philosophical questions and speculations, d\u0101na in society, questions about the origin of gods and the universe, and metaphysical issues. Its verses are still used in ceremonies (such as weddings) and pujas, thus becoming one of the oldest scriptures in the world still in use. According to Jamison and Brereton, in a 2014 translation of the Rigveda manuscript, the dating of the Regweda manuscript \"has been and is likely to continue to be debated and reconsidered\". Proposals about this dating are much inferred from the style and content of the chant itself. Philological estimates tend to strip away most texts in the second half of the 2nd millennium BC.note 1] Written in ancient Indo-Aryan languages, these chants are thought to date from the Indo-Iranian separation period, roughly 2000 BC.

Other evidence also points to 1400 BC. The core of the Regweda manuscript is thought to date back to the Bronze Age, making it one of the few examples with unbroken tradition. The composition is thought to be made between kr. 1500 \u2013 1000 BC.note 1] According to Michael Witzel, the codification of the Regweda manuscript appeared in the late Regweda period between 1200 and 1000 BC, during the time of the early Kuru Kingdom. Asko Parpola argues that this scripture was set around 1000 BC, during the reign of the Kuru Kingdom. Regweda is much more ancient than other Indo-Aryan books. This has been the center of attention of Western scholars from Max M\u00fcller and Rudolf Roth onwards. Regveda became an early milestone of Vedic religion. There are linguistic and cultural similarities to the book of Avesta, the Majusi religious scripture, descended from the Proto-Indo-Iranian period, often associated with the Andronovo culture (or perhaps the Sintashta culture at the time of Andronovo's time) around 2000 BC. Regveda shows no direct evidence of the sociopolitical system of the Vedic times, whether ordinary people or elites. Clues such as cattle herds and horse racing appear on the manuscript, and the text contains an overview of ancient Indian society. There is no evidence, according to Jamison and Brereton, that color (caste system) is quite complicated, profound, or structured. Social stratification is still embryonic, then it turns into a goal rather than a social reality. The society is semi-nomadic and pastoral with evidence of the existence of agriculture because this Vedic chant calls the term plowing and worshipping the god of agriculture. There is a division of labor, and a complementary relationship between the king and the poet-brahmin but there is no discussion of status and social class.

Reservoirs are usually built in river valleys. Reservoirs are built by building a dam, digging the ground, or applying conventional construction techniques such as making walls or pouring concrete. The term 'reservoir' can also be used to describe underground storage such as underground water sources, oil wells or water wells. Dams are also built in the valley by utilizing its topography and obtaining water for reservoirs. The edge of the valley is used as a wall and the location of the dam is built on the narrowest part, which will provide greater pressure force at a lower cost. In many places, the construction of valley reservoirs involves the removal of residents and historical artifacts, such as for example the removal of the Abu Simbel temple during the construction of the Aswan Dam. The construction of valley reservoirs also involves breaking down rivers during the process, usually by building special tunnels or channels. In hilly territories, dams are usually built by expanding existing lakes. When the topographic location is less suitable for large reservoirs, some small reservoirs are usually built to resemble chains such as the Taff River valley when three reservoirs, Llwyn-on Reservoir, Cantref Reservoir, and Beacons Reservoir. The riverside reservoir is built by pumping water from the river. Such reservoirs are usually built through excavation and construction on sections of embankments that usually cover more than 6 km. Water stored in reservoirs like this is usually precipitated for several months so that the contamination and turbidity levels are naturally reduced. Service reservoirs are reservoirs built close to distribution points, with cleaned water.

Some others are built underground, mainly for service reservoirs in countries filled with hills or mountains. The Arabian peninsular area, five thousand years ago a defunct volcanic crater was used as a reservoir by farmers for their irrigation water reservoirs. The dry climate and water scarcity in India gave rise to water resource management innovations such as the construction of a reservoir in Girnar in 3000 BC. The construction of homemade reservoirs is generally carried out on land that is free from the reach of residents or far from crowded areas. However, after completion, the function of this reservoir can be used to attract tourists or become a tourist attraction. This reservoir is usually built using heap material on the side of the reservoir. The dry climate and water scarcity in India led to the early development of water management techniques, including the construction of a reservoir in Girnar in 3000 BC. Artificial lakes created in the 5th century BC have been discovered in ancient Greece. Many of the sides of the reservoir are used to provide raw materials for water treatment plants that send drinking water through water pipes. Reservoirs not only hold water to the required level, but can be the main place in the water treatment process. The time when water is retained before being removed is known as retention time, is one of the design features that makes it easier for particles and sludge deposits to settle as when performing natural biological treatments using algae, bacteria, and zooplankton that live naturally with water. But the natural process of limnology in temperate lakes results in temperature stratification within water bodies that tend to divide into elements such as manganese and phosphorus into cold anoxic water during the summer months.

Albigensis teaches dualism. This school was condemned by the Roman Catholic Church. Albigensis belongs to the group of Catharism. They believe in dualism, that is, from the beginning of the world there are two opposing principles. The opposite principle is the principle of good (light) and evil (dark). In the end, according to this school the principle of light will be able to defeat the principle of darkness. The world was created by the principle of darkness so that the world is inherently evil. The human beings in this world are composed of elements of evil and good. What is good and eternal in man is his soul. Meanwhile, the evil thing is his body. This good and eternal human soul, imprisoned in the body. Therefore, salvation is defined as the detachment of the soul from the body that imprisons it. They also believe that there is dualism in the Creator. First, there is the Creator who creates invisible things, who is referred to as the good God. Second, there is the Creator who creates visible things. This Creator is referred to as the Wicked God. According to the Albigensis school, the creator in the Old Testament is the Wicked God. The Creator in the New Testament is the Good God. They received only part of God's power in the Old Testament that relates to the good things of the New Testament. Jesus Christ is called a quasi-angel. Thus, Jesus did not actually die and died. Jesus only taught people about true doctrine. Albigensis opposes the sacrament.

The term was introduced by John Lubbock in his paper \"Prehistoric Times\" published in 1865. But the term was not used very often until V. Gordon Childe popularized it in his book The Dawn of Europe (1947). In this age, human life went from a hunter-gatherer pattern to a way of life producing food. The existence of the ability to produce food shows that ancient humans had settled permanently. The places where ancient humans lived were found near rivers, lakes, hills and forests and places close to water. They no longer live in caves but already inhabit modestly built stilt houses. The stilt houses were erected to avoid the attack of wild beasts. At this time, hunting activities are still carried out, although the frequency is not as frequent as in the past. This shifting system is also called bergumah. Activities like this are still often found in Indonesia such as in the interior of Papua and Kalimantan. The social structure of ancient societies was still simple with a very high uniformity (homogeneity). The uniformity concerns various aspects such as aspects of the pattern and shape of the dwelling. The forms of residence are related to the structure of the farming period society. In general, the forms of dwellings (houses) from the farming period are small, round houses and roofs attached to the ground. At this time, the forms of houses left over from the prehistoric era can be found on the islands of Timor and West Kalimantan. In the population aspect, there began to be symptoms of rapid population growth. ", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "This is because at that time there began to be an assumption in society that a large number of family members would be very profitable because of the availability of labor that was used to help work in agriculture. Due to the increase in population that caused the number of labor to increase, the agricultural sphere developed rapidly. In agriculture, people began to plant agricultural land with types of crops such as tubers and fruits. From the types of plants, other types of plants developed such as grains, grains and vegetables, but in addition to farming, ancient humans also raised livestock. In their spare time while waiting for the harvest, the ancient people also filled it with various household handicraft businesses, such as weaving, making pottery and sharpening agricultural tools. The existence of ancient human skills in making handicrafts that began to be pioneered during the farming period gave rise to a specialization of work in the mining sector which was a prerequisite for the birth of procrastination. During the farming period, the ancient people were also good at making boats from large trees that were cut into pieces and used to catch fish. The boat building process is carried out by hollowing out large pieces of wood with fire and then the hole is deepened with a pickaxe so that it resembles the shape of a mortar. At that time there were also trade activities in the barter trade, namely by exchanging goods to meet the needs of daily life. The living utensils that can still be found today from mesolithic life are as follows: A square pickaxe shaped like a hoe with a size of 4\u201325 cm. The tool is made from chalcedony, agat, chert, and juspis rocks. A common type of square pickaxe is a pickaxe with variations in the form of shoulder pickaxes, ladder pickaxes, roof pickaxes, violin pickaxes and directional pickaxes. The area of discovery of square pickaxes covers almost all of Indonesia, especially in the western part.

Chelicerata in a broad sense is one of the faunal groups consisting of Arachnids, Xiphosura, extinct groups Eurypterides and Chasmataspidides and also Pycnogonides. So Chelicerata is a kind of large group that feeds on types of spiders, scorpions, pseudo-scorpions, kalavineas and even mimi and mintuno. The Chelicerata group is known for its members having a mouth apparatus in the form of chelicera consisting of two segments. In contrast to the group of insects, millipedes, and centipedes that use oral devices in the form of mandibles and maxillas consisting of more than two internodes. Today, the number of known breeds living and already found more than 100,000 types has been named. This includes very mega-diverse types, namely Acari and spiders (Araneae) which from year to year the number of new types of findings continues to increase drastically. Currently, it is known that there are about 2000 types of Chelicerata fossils and almost more than 3/4 of their number are the Arachnid group. Chelicerata is thought to have ancestors who lived in the water. However, types of chelicerata from both marine and freshwater are currently very rarely found and are limited only to sea spiders and mimi and mintuno (horseshoe crabs) as well as some aquatic Acari from the Hydracari group. That said, the group that was first believed to live on the mainland was scorpions. The fossils found in several locations are very useful to know the oldest age of a single taxon group in the Chelicerata group, or broadly all living things on this earth. For example, scorpion fossils were discovered about 430 million years ago although these finds could be older than what is known today.

Either a taxon is younger or at least as old as the group of taxons known to be fossilized. With the current development of phylogeny studies, both molecular and traditional approaches through morphology, a superimposed approach can be made to the resulting phylogeny tree. From these results, it can be estimated the age of a taxon based on the fossil record of taxons and taxons that are not yet known fossils. The result of the combination of the evolutionary tree and the fossil record can be used as a molecular clock calibration method that is plurally used in molecular approaches. Apart from being a calibration tool, from this combination can be used to estimate the divergence time obtained from molecular markers. However, the conflict between the findings of fossils in a stratigraphic layer and the results of the position of a taxon in a phylogeny tree is inevitable. For example, scorpions are one of the oldest taxons ever discovered without a doubt. In some studies of the evolution of Chelicerata, scorpions constitute the most primitive basic taxon and ancestors of all the descendants present in the chelicerata group. But in different studies, the scorpion group, which is believed to be the oldest group ever found, actually became a more advanced group or derived taxon. It is this kind of conflicting results that are still widely found that it requires more exploration of other data that can solve the problem. Although many fossils have been found and are conclusively one of the groups of Chelicerata, the findings of these fossils \u2013 not only in Chelicerata, but also other groups \u2013 in phylogeny studies continue to cause controversy that requires more explanation.

The movement was declared by the military and civilian leaders of eastern Indonesia on March 2, 1957. The center of this movement was originally in Makassar, which at that time was the capital of Sulawesi. However, slowly support in southern Sulawesi began to disappear so that in 1957 the Permesta headquarters was moved to Manado in the northern part of Sulawesi. Here came arms contact with central government forces until it reached a ceasefire in 1961. The PRRI rebellions in the west and Permesta in the east fostered a wide variety of reasons. Mainly that certain ethnic groups in Sulawesi and Central Sumatra at that time felt that the government's policies from Jakarta were stagnant on fulfilling their local economy only, which in turn limited any opportunities for the development of other regional areas. There is also a sense of hatred towards the Javanese ethnic group, which is the most numerous and influential tribe in the newly formed unitary state of Indonesia. The imbalance occurred because Indonesia's political events were concentrated on the island of Java, while the country's economic resources came more from other islands. The effect of this conflict is less about the idea of secession from the Indonesian state, but rather emphasizes the fairer division of political and economic power in Indonesia.

Demeter controls harvest, soil fertility, seasonality (denoted by Horai), and wheat. Demeter is the daughter of Kronos and Rhea. After birth, Demeter and his siblings were swallowed up by Kronos, who feared that one day his throne would be overthrown by his children. Demeter was saved by Zeus and is sometimes referred to as one of the Olympian gods in place of Hades because Hades was more often in the underworld. Demeter is a goddess who teaches humans to grow crops so that humans abandon the hunting way of life and concoct it into farming. Demeter's hair symbolizes the grains of wheat which is its symbol. Demeter is also depicted wearing a plain, circular crown worn by the goddesses. Demeter had a child named Persefone who became the wife of Hades. It is said that the story of Persefone is the origin of the four seasons. As Persefone lives with Hades, Demeter grieves and the earth experiences winter.

The literal translation of the word Theotokos into Indonesian is more or less \"The One Who Carries God\", or \"Who Gave Birth to God\"; another less literal translation is the Mother of God (English: Mother of God, Latin: Mater Dei). The earliest use of this title is affirmed in the Eastern Churches with Syrian tradition, which have used the title Theotokos in their liturgy since the early centuries: the Liturgy of Mari and Addai (3rd century), and the Liturgy of Saint James (AD 60).

While trends themselves often connote as a bizarre aesthetic expression and often last shorter than the seasons, fashion is also a distinctive expression and is supported by the industry traditionally associated with the fashion and collection seasons. Style is an expression that lasts for many seasons and is often also associated with cultural movements and social markers, emblems, classes, and cultures (eg. Baroque, Rococo, etc. ). According to sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, fashion connotes \"the latest fashion, the latest difference.\" Although they are often used simultaneously, yet the term fashion differs from clothing and costumes. The first describes technical materials and garments, while the latter has been relegated to special senses such as costumes or mask clothing. Instead, fashion itself describes a social and temporal system that \"activates\" clothing as a social marker in a particular time and context. The philosopher Giorgio Agamben attributed fashion to the current intensity from the qualitative moment, to the temporal aspect called the Greek Kairos, while clothing is the quantitative one called the Greek Chronos. Exclusive brands aspire to haute couture labels, but the term is technically limited to members of the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture in Paris. It is more aspirational and inspired by art, culture, and a movement. This is a very exclusive thing in nature.

In the mid-16th century, the church in England split into two forces; Anglicans who had power and puritans who became rivals. In those days, Queen Elizabeth I of England as Queen of England had a dislike for Puritans. Queen Elizabeth was Protestant, she changed the teachings and ceremonies of Protestant teachings. This was met with protests from Protestants, they wanted the purification of protestant teachings that Queen Elizabeth had changed a lot. These people who wanted to re-purify Protestant teachings were called Puritans. Despite the protests, Queen Elizabeth did not care and continued to practice the religious principles she professed. These protestants demanded a return to biblical teachings only, without boasting too grandiosely and holding ceremonies. When Queen Elizabeth died in 1603, she was succeeded by her cousin, King James VI of Scotland. Later King James became king of England in place of Queen Elizabeth and became known as James I. Like Queen Elizabeth, this King James I also had a dislike for the Puritans. And so the state of the Puritans in England became worse and worse. Because they received bad treatment from King James I, the puritans felt that they had to go out of England. In 1607, the separatists - a radical puritanical sect that did not believe that the State Church could be reformed - broke away to Leiden, The Netherlands, where they received asylum from the rulers there.

The stola is a sling of fabric with embroidery, formerly silk-based, about seven and a half to nine feet long and three to four inches wide, getting wider to the end. The Latin word stola comes from the Greek word \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03b7 (stol\u0113), \"clothing\", the original meaning of which is \"order\" or \"completeness\". The initial stola was a kind of scarf worn over the shoulders and dangling at the front of the body; The scarves worn by women are indeed very large in size. After being converted by the Church of Rome around the 7th century (stola had also been used by other local Churches before), the shape of the stola became narrower and more ornate as the stola developed into a kind of mark of honor. Now stola is usually wider and can be made from various types of materials. There are many theories regarding the \"ancestors\" of stola. Some argue that the stola originated from the tallit (Jewish prayer coat), due to its resemblance to the current ordinance of tallit use (Jewish worship leaders veiled their heads with tallites at the time of leading prayers) but this theory is no longer used today. The more popular theory is that the stola comes from a kind of liturgical washcloth called orarium and is very similar to sudarium. In fact, in many places stola is called orarium. Therefore the stola is connected to the rag that Jesus used when washing the feet of His disciples, and is an apt symbol of the yoke of Christ, the yoke of ministry. After all, the \"ancestor\" of the stola who was probably the closest was the scarf of office worn by the officials of the Roman Empire. When the clergy became members of the Roman administrative body, they also received the same mark of honor, which was a marker of the level of office in the hierarchy of the empire (and the Church).

Its original intention was as a mark of identification of a person in a particular organization and to indicate the rank of the person in his group, this function is what the stola still continues to this day. Thus, unlike other liturgical garments originally worn by both clergy and laymen, stola is a garment devoted to being worn by a certain class of society based on its occupation. In the Roman Catholic Church, a stola is a vestimentum that marks the reception of the sacrament of the priesthood. Stola is given in ordination to deacon, with which a person becomes a member of the clergy (the ordained). Bishops and priests wear stola by draped it over the nape of the neck and allowing its two ends to dangle at the front, while the deacon draped it over the left shoulder and crossed both ends on the right hip. In a time when Tridentina Mass was still in use, priests who were not bishops crossed stola on the chest (see lower right picture), but in Mass or other ceremonies whenever a cassula or hood was also worn. Now the stola is worn by letting both ends dangle straight (General Instructions of the Roman Mass, 340). On special occasions, the Pope wears, as part of his uniform attire, a special kind of stola that is ornate and given his personal emblem. Similarly, in the Anglican Communion Churches, stola is given when a person is ordained a deacon and draped over the shoulders. In priestly ordination, the newly ordained priest draped the stola on the nape of the neck with both ends dangling in front, either dangling straight or in the traditional way of being crossed. Evangelical clergy who objected to wearing stola for reasons of conscience, followed the reformed practice of wearing a preaching scarf.

Cholesterol is a special type of lipid called steroids, a lipid that has a chemical structure of four rings of carbon atoms. Other steroids include steroid hormones like cortisol, estrogen, and testosterone; All of these steroid hormones are made from changes in the basic chemical structure of cholesterol. In addition to being important for animal cell structure, cholesterol also serves as a precursor to the biosynthesis of steroid hormones, bile acids and vitamin D. Cholesterol is the main sterol synthesized by all animals. In vertebrates, liver cells usually produce the greatest number. Prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea), do not produce cholestetil, although there are some exceptions, such as Mycoplasma, which need cholesterol for growth. Fran\u00e7ois Poulletier de la Salle first identified cholesterol in solid form in gallstones in 1769. However, it was not until 1815 that chemist Michel Eug\u00e8ne Chevreul named the compound \"cholesterol\". Cholesterol is necessary to build and maintain and modulate membrane fluidity at physiological temperature ranges. The hydroxyl group of each cholesterol molecule interacts with the water molecules surrounding the membrane as does the polar head of the phospholipid and sphingolipid membranes, while large steroid and hydrocarbon chains are embedded in the membrane, in addition to other nonpolar lipid fatty acid chains. Through interaction with phospholipid fatty acid chains, cholesterol improves membrane packing, both of which alter the fluidity of the membrane. All animal cells process cholesterol, whether for membrane structure or other uses, with relative production rates varying between cells and organ function. Approximately 80% of total daily cholesterol production occurs in the liver and small intestine; While other places with high synthesis speed are the adrenal glands and reproductive organs. ", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "Cholesterol synthesis inside uses the mevalonate pathway, in which two acetyl CoA molecules condense to form acetoacetyl-CoA. Followed by a second condensation between acetyl CoA and acetoacetyl-CoA forming 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarate CoA (MHG-KoA). This molecule is then reduced to mevalonate by the enzyme HMG-KoA reductase. The production of mevalonate is a determinant of the reaction rate and irreversible stage in cholesterol synthesis and this becomes the catch point for the action of statin drugs (a class of cholesterol-lowering drugs). Mevalonate is eventually converted to isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) through two phosphorylation steps and one decarboxylation step that requires ATP. Three molecules of isopentenyl pyrophosphate are infiltrated to form farnesyl pyrophosphate through the action of geranyl transferase. Two molecules of farnesyl phosphatase then condense to form a squaalene with a squaline synthase catalyst inside the endoplasmic reticulum. Cyclase oxydosqualena then converts the squaalene into a circumferential form called lanosterol. Finally, lanosterol is converted into cholesterol through 19 stages of reaction. The last step consists of NADPH and oxygen which helps the oxidation of the methyl group to remove carbon, mutase to move the alkene group, and NADH to help reduce ketones. Konrad Bloch and Feodor Lynen shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1964 for their discoveries regarding several mechanisms and methods of cholesterol regulation and fatty acid metabolism. The biosynthesis of cholesterol is directly regulated by the existing cholesterol levels, although the homeostatic mechanisms involved are only partially understood. Higher intake of food leads to a net decrease in endogenous production, while lower intake of food has the opposite effect. The main regulatory mechanism is the sensing of intracellular cholesterol in the endoplasmic reticulum by SREBP proteins (sterol regulatory element-binding proteins 1 and 2).

However, historical events began to occur when the troops commanded by Mbah Kerto defended the place from the Dutch colony known as the \"Treteg Tosono\" war which was on the Brantas river bridge. The Dutch soldiers themselves built bridges as a connecting route while making it easier for the Dutch to colonize the place, but with the persistence of Mbah Kerto's troops bloodshed was inevitable. The silent witness of the war \"Treteg Tosono\" is now still stoutly standing in the throes of time and the flow of the Brantas river. To commemorate the Treteg Tosono war, usually the residents around the time of Eid al-Fitr (bodo) come directly to Treteg Tosono which is now called the old bridge, they recall and pray for the heroes who died during the Treteg Tosono war in the past.

HDMI provides an interface between multiple matching digital audio/video sources, such as a set-top box, DVD player or AV receiver as well as matching digital audio and/or video monitors, such as digital television (DTV). HDMI supports standard, higher, or high definition video, coupled with multi-channel digital audio on a single cable. This is independent of DTV standards such as ATSC, and DVB(-T,-S,-C), because they are all encapsulated MPEG data streams, passed on set-top boxes, and come out as uncompressed video data, which can be high-definition. This video data is then encoded into TMDS for digital transmission via HDMI. HDMI also supports 8 uncompressed digital audio channels. Starting with version 1.2, HDMI currently supports up to 8 one-bit audio channels. One-bit audio is used on Super Audio CDs. The standard Type A HDMI connector has 19 pins, while a higher resolution version called Type B has been defined, although it has not been used in general use. Type B has 29 pins, which are capable of carrying expanded video channels for use with high-resolution displays. Type B is designed to support resolutions higher than 1080p. HDMI Type A is also compatible with the single-link Digital Visual Interface (DVI-D) used on modern computer monitors and graphics cards. This means that the DVI source can drive the HDMI monitor, or vice versa, with the appropriate adapter or cable, but its HDMI audio and remote control features will be unavailable.

The lowest temperature limit is absolute zero, which is defined as 0.00 K on the Kelvin scale, an absolute thermodynamic temperature scale. This temperature is equivalent to \u2212273.15 \u00b0C on the Celsius scale, \u2212459.67 \u00b0F on the Fahrenheit scale, and 0.00 \u00b0R on the Rankine scale. Since temperature corresponds to the thermal energy possessed by an object or sample of matter, which is the kinetic energy of the random motion of the constituent particles of matter, an object will have less thermal energy when it is colder and more when it is hotter. If it were possible to cool a system to absolute zero, all the movement of particles in a sample of matter would stop and they would stand still completely in the sense of classical physics. Objects can be described as having zero thermal energy. Microscopically in the description of quantum mechanics, however, matter still has zero-point energy even at absolute zero, due to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Cooling refers to the process of cooling down, or lowering the temperature. This can be achieved by removing heat from the system, or exposing the system to an environment with a lower temperature. Coolant is a liquid used to cool objects, prevent freezing and prevent erosion of the engine. Air cooling is the process of cooling an object by exposing it to air. It will only work if the air temperature is lower than that of the object, and the process can be improved by increasing the surface area, increasing the flow rate of the coolant, or reducing the mass of the object. Another common cooling method is to expose objects to ice, dry ice, or liquid nitrogen. It works by conduction; heat is transferred from a relatively warm object to a relatively cold cooler.

In ancient times, ice was not adopted for food preservation but was used to cool wine which was also done by the Romans. According to Pliny, Emperor Nero invented an ice bucket to cool the wine rather than add it to the wine to make it cold because it would dilute it. Some time around 1700 BC Zimri-Lim, king of the Mari Kingdom in northwestern Iraq had created an \"ice house\" called the shurpin bit in a location close to his capital on the banks of the Euphrates river. In the 7th century BC the Chinese had used ice houses to preserve vegetables and fruits. During the reign of the Tang dynasty in China (618 -907 AD) a document refers to the practice of using ice popular during the Eastern Chou Dynasty (770 -256 BC) by 94 workers employed for the \"Ice Service\" to freeze everything from wine to corpses. Shachtman says that in the 4th century AD, the brother of the Japanese emperor Nintoku gave him a gift of ice from the mountain. The emperor was so pleased with the gift that he named June 1 as \"Ice Day\" and with the ceremony of giving ice blocks to his officials. Even in ancient times, Shachtman said, in Egypt and India, night cooling with evaporation of water and heat radiation, and the ability of salt to lower the freezing temperature of water were practiced. The ancients of Rome and Greece realized that boiled water cools faster than ordinary water;  the reason is that by boiling water, carbon dioxide and other gases, which block cooling, are removed;  But this fact was not known until the 17th century.

Torture and genocide are carried out in several stages.

There is a difference of opinion as to how much the German civilian population knows about the government's conspiracy against Jews. Most historians claim that the civilian population was unaware of the atrocities committed by the government, in particular those that occurred in concentration camps, located outside Germany in Nazi-occupied Europe. However, historian Robert Gellately claims that the government publicly announced the conspiracy through the media, and that civilians knew every aspect of it except the use of gas chambers. Significant historical evidence points to the idea that most victims of the Holocaust, before being sent to concentration camps, did not know the fate that awaited them, or did not believe it.

In Indonesian read ye. In different languages, Y has different sound values. The International Phonetic Alphabet uses a small Y as a symbol of the closed front round vowel sound. The original ancestor of the letter Y was the Greek letter upsilon. The use of the letter Y in the Latin alphabet dates back to the first century BC. The letter was used to write loanwords from Greek, so Y is not a letter to write the original Latin vocabulary and is usually pronounced /u/ or /i/. The second pronunciation became common in classical times and was used by many people except the educated circles. Claudius, Roman Emperor introduced new letters into the Latin alphabet to symbolize the so-called sonus medius (short vowels before lip consonants), but sometimes in inscriptions it is written as upsilon letters from Greece. In ancient Greece, the letter \u03a5 (Upsilon) symbolized u], before switching to y] (info) (rounded closed front vowel). Originally the Ancient Romans adapted this letter into the letter V, to signify the sound of the vowel /u/ and the consonant /w/, but not long after, because the term Ypsilon in Greek moved to the vowel /y/, the Romans borrowed the Greek letter according to its original form including the vertical line below it, specifically to mark greek names and loanwords. Y is named Y Graeca, 'Greek Y'. There is no doubt that the pronunciation is I Graeca, 'Greek I', because Latin speakers find it difficult to pronounce the front vowel y] (info), which is not found in the original vocabulary of Latin. In the Romance language family, the pronunciation becomes a common name: i griega in Spanish, i grec in French, etc. ", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "The letter Y was used in Old English and Latin to symbolize the phoneme /y/; however, there are those who analyze this use as a creation in itself in England by combining V and above I, without linking the use of this letter in Latin. It is also possible that the letter Y, although named Y Gr\u00e6ca (pronounced u gre:ka]) or 'Greek u' to be distinguished from /u/ in Latin, is still analyzed as the letter V (called /u\u02d0/) above the letter I (called /i\u02d0/). Then the letter Y is called u\u02d0 i\u02d0]; after /u\u02d0/ becomes /w/ and after a massive vowel shift in English then the designation becomes /wa\u026a/. In Middle English times, the vowel roundness /y/ (closed front vowel \"round\") faded so that the sound was similar to the vowels /i\u02d0/ (closed front vowel \"not round\") and /\u026a/. Therefore, many words are originally spelled with I then spelled with Y, and vice versa. A similar replacement occurs in Latin vocabulary: the original word silva (\"wood\") is spelled with Y in the Pennsylvanian word. Similarly, the vowel Y in Modern English is pronounced similar to I, but modern English uses it only in certain words, unlike Middle and Early Modern English. The letter has three uses: a substitute for upsilon in the Greek word (system; Greek: \u03c3\u03cd\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1), at the end of a word (rye, city; compare cities, whose final letter is S), and in a monosyllabic base word one with the end of the vowel (dy-ing).

According to Pararaton, Anusapati or also called Panji Anusapati is the son of Stump Ametung and Ken Dedes. Her father was killed by Ken Arok while she was still in the womb. Ken Arok later married Ken Dedes and took over the post of Stump Ametung as akuwu Tumapel. Then in 1222 Ken Arok announced the founding of the Kingdom of Tumapel. He even managed to tear down the Kadiri Kingdom under Kertajaya's rule. When Ken Arok appointed Mahisa Wong Ateleng as the ruler of Kediri. This causes Anusapati to feel astonished at Ken Arok's attitude, even though he is Ken Arok's eldest son. He also feels less loved by Ken Arok than his other siblings. After urging his mother (Ken Dedes), he finally finds out that he is actually the biological son of Stump Ametung who was killed by Ken Arok. Anusapati also managed to get a dagger made by Mpu Gandring that Ken Arok used to kill his father. Using the dagger, Anusapati's helper from Batil Village managed to kill Ken Arok while having dinner, in 1168 (1247 AD). Anusapati instead killed his maid to remove traces. To everyone he announced that his maid had gone crazy and went on a rampage to the point of killing the king. After the death of Ken Arok, Anusapati ascended the throne in 1170 (1248 AD). His administration was stricken with anxiety over the threat of revenge by Ken Arok's children. The castle where Anusapati lived was given a tight escort, even surrounded by a deep moat.

Anusapati obeyed unsuspectingly because it was indeed his favorite. When Anusapati was engrossed in watching the chicken fight, Tohjaya suddenly stabbed him using Mpu Gandring's dagger. Anusapati was killed instantly. The event occurred in 1171 (1249 AD). After Anusapati's death, Tohjaya ascended the throne. However, his reign lasted only a short time because he was later killed in 1172 (in 1250 AD) due to the rebellion of Ranggawuni son of Anusapati and Mahisa Campaka son of Mahisa Wong Ateleng. According to Nagarakretagama, Anusapati whose title is Bhatara Anusapati is the son of \"Sri Ranggah Rajasa Sang Girinathaputra\", which is the name of the founder of the Tumapel Kingdom. In other words, he is the son of Ken Arok, because Nagarakretagama never mentioned the existence of the figure of Stump Ametung. It is also said that Bhatara Anusapati ruled since 1227 in place of his father. His reign went quietly. The whole land of Java is safe and submissive to it. Anusapati died in 1248 and was succeeded by his son Vishnuwardhana. In honor of Anusapati, Kidal Temple was established in Kidal Village, Tumpang District, about 20 km east of Malang City - East Java, where he was worshipped as Shiva. The name Anusapati is found only in Pararaton and Nagarakretagama. The Pararaton manuscript was written hundreds of years after the time of Tumapel and Majapahit. Meanwhile, Nagarakretagama was written in the middle of the heyday of Majapahit (1365). In some ways, Nagarakretagama's descriptions tend to be more believable than Pararaton's, as the writing time is much earlier. If in Pararaton it is mentioned Anusapati died because he was killed by Tohjaya, then Nagarakretagama wrote Anusapati died a natural death. There are two allegations as to why Nagarakretagama did not recount Anusapati's murder.

This weapon is sometimes found in FPS games like Valorant, CSGO, Call of Duty, etc. Karambit originated from Minangkabau which spread throughout the archipelago Based on written history, kerambit originated from Minangkabau. Later, this object was brought by the Minangkabau nomads centuries ago and spread to various regions, such as Java, the Malay Peninsula and others. According to folklore, the shape of the kerambit was inspired by tiger claws that roamed a lot in the forests of Sumatra at that time. Weapons in most parts of the archipelago, were originally agricultural tools designed to sweep roots, collect rice stalks and rice threshing tools. But unlike kerambit, he deliberately designed to be more curved like a tiger's hoof, after seeing tigers fighting using their claws, this is in line with the Minangkabau philosophy which reads Alam takambang became a teacher. Kerambit eventually spread through Southeast Asian trade networks to countries, Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines and Thailand. History books in Europe say that soldiers in Indonesia were armed with daggers at the waist and spears in their hands, while the kerambit was used as a last resort when other weapons ran out or were lost in battle.

At its peak in 2005, several large US companies such as Emerson Knives and Strider Knives made kerambit knives in large quantities. The pioneer of the use of kerambit is Steve Tarani who has a kerambit base from Silat Cimande Sunda. Currently kerambit has been developed western side with many variants. In Indonesia, kerambit is used by Sumatran Silat such as Silat Harimau / Silek Harimau Minangkabau with the name kurambiak / karambiak. For kerambit of Sumatran origin, the oldest record found is the use of kerambit written in the British Asian Journal, July \u2013 Dec 1827. Although kerambit is a mandatory weapon of US Marshal personnel, but in Indonesia itself it is less popular. This is because this weapon is a deadly secret weapon and there is no effort by the Indonesian government or military in this case the TNI to use or preserve it. The weapon is held by inserting the first or index finger into the hole at the top of the handle so that the curvature of the knife points forward from the bottom of the fist. It is mainly used in cutting by turning the hand when the kerambit has entered or hit the target so that the inside of the target, such as veins, intestines and others become severed. The wound from the kerambit looks small from the outside, but inside, the veins or intestines have broken off. With the entry of the index finger into the hole of the kerambit handle, it makes it difficult for the opponent to disarm the weapon and allows the kerambit to maneuver in the fingers without losing the grip.

Rape by foreigners is usually less common than rape by people known to the victim, and rape in prison between a man and a woman with a woman is common and is probably the least reported form of rape. Widespread and systematic rape (for example, war rape) and sexual slavery can occur during international conflicts. These practices constitute crimes against humanity and war crimes.

Serious injuries can occur along with the risk of pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. A person who experiences rape may face violence or threats from the rapist, and sometimes also from the victim's family and relatives. The term rape (rape) comes from the Latin rapere (supine word of raptum) which means \"to seize, grab, take away\". In Roman law, taking away a woman by force, with or without sexual intercourse, was a \"raptus\". In Middle English, the same term can refer to kidnapping or rape in the modern sense meaning \"sexual misconduct\". The original meaning of \"carrying by force\" is still found in some phrases, such as \"rape and looting\", or in the title, as in the story Sabine Woman Rape and Europa Rape or the poem The Rape of the Lock about the theft of a lock of hair. Rape is defined in most jurisdictions as sexual intercourse, or other forms of sexual penetration, committed by the perpetrator against the victim without consent (consensual). The definition of rape itself is inconsistent between government health organizations, law enforcement, health care providers, and the legal profession. The definition of rape varies historically and culturally. Initially, rape had no sexual connotations and is still used in other contexts in the English language. In Roman law, the definition of rape or raptus was classified as a form of crime (crimen vis) i.e. \"crime of assault\". Raptus refers to the abduction of a woman against the wishes of a man who is under her power, and sexual intercourse is not a necessary element. Other definitions of rape have changed over time.

In Indonesia, the term \"college\" is commonly used as a designation for educational institutions established, owned, and managed by Jesuit padri-padri (Catholic clergy of the Society of Jesus). The purpose of establishing the college was to prepare/educate young people to have intellectual skills and live in harmony with God, thus being ready to become religious and community leaders. In Ancient Rome, a collegium was a group or association, that is, a group of people who lived together according to a certain set of rules (from the word con- = \"together\" + leg- = \"law\" or lego = \"I choose\" or \"I read\"). The term collegium also means council, assembly, or professional office (collegium), which derives the terms \"collegial\" (peers), and \"colleagues\" (peers).

Some time after the birth of the Society of Jesus, Ignatius and his companions faced a major problem in seeking new adult energies who were as capable, educated, and called as they were. This young union was asked to carry out increasingly arduous tasks. The only recourse is to set up several educational centers for young people who are called to serve like them. These educational centers were so successful and famous that many parents wanted to entrust their children into Jesuit educational centers that were later called collegiums or colleges. The literal meaning of college is a place of study together or boarding school (in Latin the word means 'together' while legere means 'to read' or 'to learn'). The college is renowned for its humanism education and its alumni. At that time, humanism or humanity was developing. Humanism focuses attention on human dignity (in Latin the word \"homo\" means \"man\"). One branch of humanism sees man as totally autonomous and therefore must develop all his potential without heeding faith and religion and even rejecting God. The educational source of humanism is Greco-Roman literary and cultural works that are much of higher quality than contemporary cultural literature that are too influenced by religion and scripture. The College developed religious humanism, which is a humanism that on the one hand recognizes human autonomy and potential and on the other hand recognizes that its dignity, autonomy, and potential are rooted in the essence of man as the children of God whom He loves. Thus for intellectual development, the college was able to make optimal use of educational resources of Greco-Roman literary and cultural works.

The scope of the biome includes several ecosystems with large regional elements and different from the biosphere. A biome is characterized by the presence of a typical plant and animal community. On Earth, biomes can be grouped into seven main types of biomes, namely tropical rainforests, savannas, grasslands, deserts, deciduous forests, tundra, and taiga. The vegetation that occurs in each environment has its own uniqueness. The uniqueness of plant vegetation is a form of plant adaptation to a unique growth environment. Desert biomes are abundant in North America, North Africa, Australia, and Western Asia. The main characteristics of the desert biome are very low rainfall and faster evaporation of water than precipitation. Precipitation is capable of reaching only 25 cm per year. In addition, the humidity of the air is very low and the daytime and nighttime temperatures have a very high difference. The ambient temperature during the day can reach 40oC and the nighttime temperature can reach 0oC. The soil properties of the desert biome are not capable of storing water so it is very barren. In the desert biome, plants are generally xerophytic and able to adapt to arid areas. Meanwhile, the fauna characteristic of the desert biome is that animals are large in size. The only types of animals in the desert biome that are active all the time are capable of storing water reserves, for example, camels. Meanwhile, rodents, reptiles, and seranggga are only active in the morning and hide in holes during the day due to the scorching heat of the sun. Plants living in the desert have thorns and are leafless. Xerophytic plants have a surface area smaller than their volume which causes the cell size to shrink and the cell wall to thicken. ", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "In addition, the vascular and stomata network systems increase densely and the number of pole tissues increases, while the sponge network decreases. Xerophytic plants also have long roots so that they can draw water from deep places. Ang timbuh plants in the desert include succulent plants whose leaves are often covered by feathers and organ tissues capable of water storage. Leaf size reduction is a form of adaptation of a barren place. Small leaves cause the transpiration speed to decrease so that the water in the sponge tissue can be stored longer. The grassland biome covers the tropics up to areas that have a temperate climate. This type of meadow biome can be found in Hungary, South Russia, Central Asia, South America and Australia. The meadow biome has its rainfall that ranges from 25\u201350 cm per year. While in some other areas, rainfall can reach 100 cm per year. The decrease in rainfall levels occurs irregularly so that porosity and drainage are not good. The impact of this rainfall irregularity is that plants are difficult to absorb water. On pastures almost no trees are found. The meadow biome consists only of terna plants and grasses. Plants that grow in the grassy biome grow by relying on moisture. In meadows, the most commonly found vegetation is grass. In wet meadow areas, the size of a living grass can reach three meters, for example, Bluestem grass and Sorghastrum beans. In dry steppe areas, the size of the grass is very short, for example, blue Grama grass and buffalo grass. The height of the rumbuke is fully affected by the amount of precipitation in direct proportional. The savanna biome is a grassland located in a tropical and sub-tropical climate.

Asymptomatic is also common in the transmission of TORCH by the mother to the fetus with a high risk of congenital abnormalities or newborn death. Asymptomatic conditions also occur in zoonoses, in particular toxoplasmosis. A condition that appears to be the same as humans is an asymptomatic infection. This asymptomatic condition is commonly found in sheep, cats, goats, pigs, and dogs. Dengue fever is one type of tropical disease that is difficult to distinguish from other types of fever. The diagnosis of dengue fever can be erroneous because dengue virus infection can be asymptomatic or have unclear symptoms. Symptoms in the form of fever only appear suddenly after the incubation period. Acute rheumatic fever is always preceded by an asymptomatic condition. Before clinical symptoms appear, the patient will have acute pharyngitis for about 20 days. Asymptomatic conditions occur in type 2 diabetes mellitus. The cause of delayed diagnosis in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus is the presence of an asymptomatic period that lasts for a long period of time. Asymptomatic conditions are generally known by chance. Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome that appears in people with diabetes mellitus is the result of an asymptomatic condition.

Asymptomatic conditions generally occur in patients with hepatiti genetic markers who have only slightly increased. In hepatitis C, the asymptomatic condition ends after the prodromal phase begins. Asymptomatic conditions are also experienced by people with chronic hepatitis who only experience an increase in genetic markers after being examined regularly in the laboratory. Asymptomatic conditions can occur in hypoglycemia with blood sugar levels when less than 70 mg/dl. Asymptomatic hypoglycemia can be noticed by independent monitoring of blood glucose.

On everyday issues (and only for flow substances), viscosity is \"thickness\" or \"internal friction\". Therefore, water that is \"thin\", has a lower viscosity, while honey that is \"thick\", has a higher viscosity. Simply put, the lower the viscosity of a flow substance, the greater the movement of the flow. Viscosity explains the internal resistance of the flow substance to flow and can probably be thought of as a measurement of the shift of the flow. For example, the high viscosity of the magma will create a high and steep statovolcano, since it cannot flow too far before cooling, while the lower viscosity of the lava will create a low and wide volcano. All flow substances (except superfluides) have resistance from pressure and are therefore called viscous, but flow substances that do not have pressure and stress resistance are called ideal flows. The study of flowing material is called Rheology, which includes viscosity and related concepts. The word \"viscosity\" comes from the Latin \"viscum alba\", meaning white mistletoe. A thick glue called \"birdlime\" is made from mistletoe fruit and used on lemon twigs to catch birds. In general, at each flow, the layers move at different speeds and the viscosity of the fluid increases from the shear pressure between the layers that definitively counteracts each exerted force. The relationship between shear pressure and speed gradient can be obtained by considering that two plates are closely separated by a distance y, and separated by homogeneous elements. Assume that the plate is very large with a cross-sectional area of A, and the side effects are negligible, and the lower plate remains, assuming the F force can be applied to the upper plate. ", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "If this force causes the element between the plates to undergo a shear flow with a gradient of u/y velocity, the element is called fluid. When a shear pressure is applied to a solid object, the body will be deformed resulting in the opposite force to compensate, an equilibrium. However, when a shear pressure is applied to a fluid, such as a wind blowing over the surface of an ocean, the fluid flows, and continues to flow when pressure is applied. When the pressure is removed, generally the flow decreases due to internal changes in energy. Viscosity can be measured by different types of viscometers and rheometers. Rheometers are used for fluids that cannot be determined by a single viscosity value and therefore require more parameters to be established and measured. Close temperature control of the fluid is essential for obtaining accurate measurements, especially in materials such as lubricants, whose viscosity can double with a change of only 5 \u00b0 C. One of the most common instruments for measuring kinematic viscosity is a glass capillary viscometer. In the coating industry, viscosity can be measured by a bowl in which efflux time is measured. There are several types of cups - such as Zahn cups and Ford viscosity cups - with the use of each type varying mainly according to the industry. Efflux time can also be converted into kinematic viscosity (centistoke, cSt) via conversion equations. Also used in coatings, the Stormer viscometer uses load-based rotation to determine viscosity. Viscosity is reported in Krebs (KU) units, which is unique to Stormer viscomemeters. Extensional viscosity can be measured by various rheometers applying extensional stress. The volume of viscosity can be measured with an acoustic rheometer. Pseudo-viscosity is a calculation obtained from tests carried out on drilling fluids used in the development of oil or gas wells.

To this day donkeys and carts are still the main means of transportation. In 2007, Changchun would host the 2007 Winter Asian Games. Changchun is a fledgling city and has about 200 years of history. In 1800, Emperor Jiaqing of the Qing dynasty chose a small village on the east bank of the Yitong River and named the area \"Changchun Ting\", and in 1889, it was changed to \"Changchun Fu\". In 1930, Japanese colonists invaded the northeastern regions of China, and established the state of Manchuria with Changchun as the capital of the country. Later, Changchun's name was changed to \"Xinjing\". After the founding of the People's Republic of China, particularly since reforms and open-door politics were made, drastic changes took place in Changchun. By this time, Changchun had turned into a city of industry, agriculture and commerce. Changchun became an influential city in China with an openness to the fields of science and education. The city is also known as the automotive city, the forest city, the film city, and the city of science, technology and culture. As an industrial city, Changchun is one of the centers of the automotive industry. Cars, buses, tires, medicines, and textiles are also produced in Changchun.

Thukidides is called the father of \"scientific history\" because of his strict standards for collecting evidence as well as his analysis of causation without reference to the interference of the gods, as mentioned in the introduction to his work. He is also called the father of the school of political realism, who sees the relationship of antabangsa based on who is strong, rather than who is right. Her work was studied in military colleges around the world, and Melia's dialogue remains a seminal work in the theory of international relations. More generally, Thukidides showed interest in developing human understanding to explain behavior in crises, for example in plagues, massacres, and civil wars. Thukidides is one of those figures who views history as an example of life. He establishes a form of decline or progress from a history based on philosophical values. The benchmark is the good value and the bad value of a goal. Thukidides is a historian who wrote the Peloponnesos War. He became the first historian known to think critically.

Suzuki produces cars, four-wheel drive vehicles, motorcycles, all-terrain vehicles (ATVs), outboard engines, wheelchairs, and a wide variety of other small internal combustion engines. In 2016, Suzuki was the 11th largest automotive manufacturer in the world. Suzuki employs more than 45,000 people and has 35 production facilities in 23 countries, as well as 133 distributors in 192 countries. Suzuki's car sales volume is the 10th largest in the world, while Suzuki's domestic sales volume is the third largest in Japan. Suzuki's domestic motorcycle sales volume is the third largest in Japan. In 1909, Michio Suzuki (1887\u20131982) founded the Suzuki Loom Works in Hamamatsu, Japan. Suzuki Loom Works also grew rapidly by producing looms for the silk processing industry in Japan. In 1929, Michio Suzuki created a new type of weaving machine, which was then exported outside Japan. For the first 30 years, Suzuki Loom Works focused on the development and production of the engine.citation needed] Although the loom was a success, Suzuki believed that his company would be more successful if it diversified. Based on consumer demand, Suzuki then decided to produce a small car. The project began in 1937, and in just over two years, Suzuki managed to produce a number of small prototype cars powered by four-cylinder, four-stroke, liquid-cooled engines. The engine is equipped with a crankcase and gearbox made of cast aluminum, and can produce 13 horsepower (9.7 kW) with an engine capacity of less than 800cc.citation needed] As a result of the outbreak of World War II, Suzuki's plans to produce new vehicles were halted, as the government declared that civilian cars were a \"non-essential commodity\".

After the war, Japanese society was in dire need of a reliable and affordable mode of private transportation. A number of companies have also begun to offer gas engines that can be installed on bicycles.

The new double sprocket gear system allows riders to pedal with engine assistance, pedal without engine assistance, or use the engine only.citation needed] The patent office then gave Suzuki a financial subsidy to continue research in motorcycle engineering. In 1954, Suzuki produced 6,000 units of motorcycles per month and the company's name was changed to Suzuki Motor Co., Ltd. After the success of its first motorcycle, Suzuki began to produce an even more successful car, the Suzuki Suzulight in 1955.

Ephedrine and pseudoephedrine increase blood pressure and serve as bronchodilators, with pseudoephedrine providing a weaker effect. Ephedrine can trigger light weight loss, and short-term, especially in fat, but the effects of its long-term use are unknown . In mice, Ephedrine is known to stimulate thermogenesis in brown fat tissue, but because adult humans only have small amounts of brown fat, thermogenesis is thought to occur primarily in skeletal muscle. Ephedrine also lowers gastric emptying time. Methylxanthine compounds such as caffeine and theophylline have weight loss effects that work synergistically with Ephedrine. This condition led to the creation and marketing of products containing such compounds. One such product, known as the ECA stack, contains Ephedrine with caffeine and aspirin. This product is a popular supplement used by bodybuilding athletes who try to reduce fat loss before undergoing a competition. As a phenethylamine compound, Ephedrine has a chemical structure similar to amphetamines and is also an analogue of methamphetamine because it has a methamphetamine structure with a hydroxyl group at the \u00df position. Because of the similarity in chemical structure, ephedrine can be used to make methamphetamine using a reduction process, namely removing hydroxyl groups in Ephedrine; this process causes Ephedrine to become one of the most sought-after precursor compounds in the illegal production of methamphetamine. The most popular method of converting Ephedrine into methamphetamine is similar to the Birch reduction reaction, which uses anhydrous ammonia and metal lithium in the reaction. The second most widely used method is the reaction of red phosphorus, iodine, and Ephedrine. Through the oxidation process, ephedrine can be synthesized easily into methcathinone.

Originally this letter symbolized the u] sound, the back vowel was closed round, but the vowel became a separate letter (U), while V became the symbol of the sound v] (info) (a voiced lip-tooth hissing consonant). In Indonesian is often pronounced like f] (info) (voiceless lip-tooth hissing consonant). The letter V comes from the Semitic letter Waw, as do the modern letters F, U, W, and Y. Semitic letters later influenced the Phoenician, Greek, and Etruscan letters. Latin letters are influenced by Greek letters, with changes as necessary for reasons of phonological adjustment and so on. In Greek, the letter upsilon (\u03a5) was adapted from the letter waw, originally to symbolize the vowel sound /u/ as in the word \"moon\", later changed to /y/ (the front vowel closed round), which is the same as the pronunciation of the letter \u00fc in German. In Latin, this upsilon letter is borrowed in the form of the letter V (without a bar) to signify the same /u/ sound, and also the consonant sound /w/. Therefore, the word num\u2014or its origin spelled NVM\u2014is called \"noom\" (/num/) while the word via/VIA is called \"wi-a\" (/wia/). Starting in the first century AD, depending on the local dialect, the /w/ consonant changed to /\u03b2/, and finally to /v/. At the end of the Middle Ages, there were two forms of the letter v or u, both of which were used for the sounds /u/ and /v/. The angular v-shape is written at the beginning of the word, while the round u shape is used in the middle or end of the word regardless of the sound. Therefore, words like valour and excuse are the same as spellings today, but the words have and upon are written haue and vpon. Finally in the 1700s, in order for consonant and vowel sounds to be alienated, the v-shape signified a consonant while the u-shape was for vowels, so the modern letter u was born. ", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "It was during this time that the uppercase U was created; previously it was always used uppercase V. Initially, since the letters you and v were made into different letters, v preceded you in alphabetical order, but now the opposite happens. In the Roman numeral system, the letter V symbolizes the number 5 or year 5, because it resembles the custom of counting notches carved on wood, that is, each fifth notch is circumcised two to form a \"V\". In the International Phonetic Alphabet system, /v/ signifies the sound of a voiced lip-tooth hissing consonant. In Irish, the letter \u2039v\u203a is mostly used in absorption words, such as veidhl\u00edn from English violin. But the sound v] appears naturally in Irish when the /b/ sound is lenitized or \"softened\", written according to orthography with \u2039bh\u203a, so that bh\u00ed is pronounced vji\u02d0], an bhean is pronounced \u0259n\u032a\u0263 \u02c8vjan\u032a\u0263], etc. Polish does not use the letter V, nor do Q and X. However, their language contains the sound /v/, which is denoted by the letter W, following the rules in German. In the Chinese pinyin system, all Latin letters are used except the letter V, because there is no v] sound in Chinese, but the letter \"v\" is used by most typing rules in place of the letter \"\u00fc\" which is generally not available on regular keyboards. Romanization is a widely practiced rule for typing Chinese phonetically. In Sanskrit or IAST, the letter V is used as a symbol of the \u028b] (info) sound (lip-tooth consonant), which in the Dewanagari script is written \u0935. In other Brahmi-derived scripts (e.g. Thai, Javanese, Balinese, etc.) that preserve the word absorption from Sanskrit, if in phonology the language does not contain consonant sounds almost lip-tooth, then the symbols of those consonants in their script are often replaced by near-palate consonants (IPA symbol: /w/), written in Latin letters as W.

Freedom, can also be interpreted as having the ability to act or change without restrictions. Something is \"free\" if it can change easily and is not restricted under the present circumstances. In philosophy and religion, freedom is associated with having free will and existence without undue or unjust restrictions, or slavery, and is an idea closely related to the concept of freedom. Freedom in general is included in the concept of political philosophy and recognizes the conditions in which the individual has the ability to act according to his wishes. In modern politics, freedom is a state of freedom in society from control or restriction in the form of oppression imposed by authorities on various aspects of life, including one's way of life, behavior, or political views. The individualist and liberal conception of freedom relates to the freedom of the individual from beyond the will; A socialist perspective, on the other hand, considers freedom as an equal distribution of power, arguing that freedom without equal numbers to the domination of the most powerful. In philosophy, freedom involves free will, in contrast to determinism. In theology, freedom is freedom from the influence of \"sin, spiritual slavery, or worldly ties\". Sometimes freedom is differentiated into two meanings. First, freedom means the ability to do what is desired and what has the power to do. While liberty means the absence of arbitrary restrictions, taking into account the rights of all involved. In this sense, the exercise of freedom is subject to ability and is limited by the rights of others. Thus, in liberty, it is necessary to have a sense of responsibility that is limited to the rules of law that apply without depriving others of their freedom.

The word \"freedom\" is often used in slogans, such as \"Life, Freedom, and the Search for Happiness\" or \"Freedom, Equality, Fraternity\" From the very beginning, many philosophers considered the concept of freedom. The Emperor of Rome, Marcus Aurelius had the following ideas: \"A government in which there are just laws for all people, a government run with due regard to equal rights and freedom of speech, and the idea of a king's government that respects almost all the freedoms of his people.\" According to Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679): \"A free man is one who in many ways uses his power and intelligence, capable of doing what he wants to do without being hindered by anything.\u2014 Leviathan, Part 2, Chapter.

According to Locke: \"Under natural circumstances, freedom means being free from any superior force that exists on Earth. People who are not under the will or law-making authority of others but only have natural laws for their rule. In a political society, freedom means not being under the power of other lawmakers except those established by consent in the commonwealth.

The history of Saipem is closely related to the era of Enrico Mattei's leadership in Eni during the Italian economic miracle. In the early 1950s, Mattei reorganized the Italian oil industry through a series of direct acquisitions and government investments, to ensure Italy's independence in the energy sector. At first, Mattei focused on natural gas, the only widely available energy source in Italy, through Snam, a newly established gas pipeline company. In the late 1950s, Eni's subsidiary, Snam, was in charge of two subholdings: Snam Montaggi, which was formed in 1955 to build pipelines and drilling platforms, and Snam Progetti, which was formed in 1956 to focus on tankers.

The cigarette is burned at one end and allowed to smolder so that the smoke can be inhaled through the mouth at the other end. Cigarettes are usually sold in box-shaped packages or paper packaging that can be easily put in a pocket. Since recent years, the packages have also generally been accompanied by health messages warning smokers of the health hazards that can result from smoking, such as lung cancer or heart attack (although in reality those messages are often ignored). The humans of the world who smoked for the first time were an ethnic group of Indians in America, for ritual purposes such as worshipping gods or spirits. In the 16th century, when Europeans discovered the Americas, some of those European explorers dabbled in smoking cigarettes and then brought tobacco to Europe. Then the habit of smoking began to appear among the European nobility. But unlike the Indians who smoked for ritual purposes, in Europe people smoked only for sheer pleasure. In the 17th century Spanish traders entered Turkiye and at that time the habit of smoking began to enter Islamic countries. According to research, 51.1% of Indonesians are active smokers and are the highest in ASEAN. This is very different from neighboring countries, for example: Brunei Darusallam 0.06% and Cambodia 1.15%. In 2013, 43.8% of smokers were from the weak class; 37.7% of smokers only have an elementary school diploma; farmers, fishermen and laborers make up 44.5% of active smokers. 33.4% of active smokers are between the ages of 30 to 34.

There have been many studies that prove that cigarettes cause dependence very much, in addition to causing many types of cancer, heart disease, respiratory diseases, gastrointestinal diseases, adverse effects on birth, and emphysema. Cigarettes are distinguished into several types. This distinction is based on cigarette wrapping materials, cigarette raw materials or contents, the process of making cigarettes, and the use of filters on cigarettes. The type of cigarette is also seen from its nicotine and tar levels. Cigarettes based on packaging materials. Cigarettes based on raw materials or contents. Cigarettes based on the manufacturing process. Machine Kretek cigarettes themselves can be categorized into 2 parts: Cigarettes based on the use of filters.

Cigarettes can make addicts suffer from a variety of diseases. Based on the book written by Teddie Sukmana, A.md entitled Knowing Cigarettes and their Dangers (2019), cigarettes can cause respiratory problems, dry coughs, and pain in the lungs. In addition, cigarettes can also cause lung pain, heart attack, stroke, cancer, impotence, and pregnancy disorders. It is common understanding that cigarettes are one of the main causes of cancer, especially lung cancer. One of the causes is because cigarette burning produces TAR. TAR is a toxic substance that results from a wide variety of incomplete combustion, such as waste incineration, foods such as satay or barbecue meat, and tobacco burning. Research at the Faculty of Medicine, Gadjah Mada University shows that active smoking mothers have the lightest and shortest babies compared to passive smoker mothers, especially when compared to non-smoker mothers with non-smoking families.

She married Udayana, king of Bali from the Warmadeva dynasty, who later had several sons, namely Airlangga who later became king in Java (Kahuripan Kingdom). His younger sons were Marakata Pangkaja (later king of Bali after Udayana's death) and Anak Wungsu (ascended to the Balinese throne after Marakata's death). In Bali, Mahendradatta is associated with the legendary creature rangda. Gunapriyadharmapatni was born in 961 AD and grew up in the palace of Watugaluh, East Java. She was the Javanese princess of the Isyana Dynasty in East Java, the daughter of king Sri Makutawangsawarddhana of the late Medang Kingdom period. She was also the sister of King Dharmawangsa of Medang. She was later betrothed to the Balinese king Udayana, and moved to the island as empress and took the name Mahendradatta. Her strong position as the daughter of the ruling Medang Kingdom has led historians to state that in fact Mahendradatta was the ruling queen on the island of Bali. Her marriage to Medang followers, the Warmadewa family of Bali was a political arrangement to seal Bali as part of the Medang Kingdom in East Java. Her position as a powerful foreign queen has caused the Balinese court to respect or even fear her. She conceived her first son, Airlangga, in her 30s, quite late for women in ancient Java and Bali. However, there is speculation that Mahendradatta may have been married before Udayana. Thus Airlangga was not the biological son of king Udayana, he was conceived from a previous union with an unknown man, that after his separation (either by death or divorce) he was later betrothed to the king of Bali, and he brought the baby Airlangga to Bali. ", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "Historical sources seem to be omitted over Mahendradatta's previous alleged marriage, that it may or may not have happened. This suspicion is because although Airlangga was Mahendradatta's eldest son, strangely he was not elected crown prince of Bali, his younger brother Marakata and later Son of Wung\u00e7u ascended to the throne of Bali instead. In addition, Mahendradatta sent Airlangga back to Java during his teenage years. Mahendradatta was known to promote the cult of Durga in Bali, and strangely later attributed to the legend of the evil witch Rangda Bali, which translates to \"widow\". Balinese folklore more or less mentions Mahendradatta's life story related to Balinese mythology about Rangda. The story continues that the queen was cursed and exiled by the king for allegedly practicing magic and black magic. After she became a widow, hurt and humiliated, she took revenge on her ex-husband's palace and his entire kingdom. He summoned all the evil spirits in the forest, leyak and the demons that caused plague and death in the kingdom. He proceeds to take revenge by killing half the kingdom with a plague before being overcome by the saints. The seemingly bad image in Balinese folklore may reflect her actual life that her marriage went badly, or be motivated by Balinese court politics to discredit the ruling Javanese foreign queen. Her marriage may not have been smooth, that the queen defied the Bali Warmadewa court and her own husband. Mahendradatta is known for his devotion to Durga. He is believed to have brought the Durga sect to Bali from Java. Although Durga is known as a companion of Shiva, in ancient Javanese and Balinese traditions, Durga is described as having a fierce nature, in contrast to other shakti and deities; good empress Vishnu Lakshmi. The cult of Durga is traditionally associated with sacrifice, black magic and magic.

The magnitude of the Earth's magnetic field varies between 25 to 65 microtesla (0.25 to 0.65 gauss). The poles of Earth's magnetic field are estimated to be tilted ten degrees towards the Earth's axis, and continue to move all the time due to the movement of molten alloyed iron within the Earth's outer core. Earth's magnetic poles move so slowly that the compass can still function properly since it was first used (11th century AD). But once every few hundred thousand years, Earth's magnetic poles turn between north and south. This inversion is recorded in the pattern of Earth's ancient rocks containing ferromagnetic elements. The movement of continental plates is also affected by the magnetic field. The layer above the ionosphere is also called the magnetosphere, which is the layer where the Earth's magnetic field protects the Earth from cosmic radiation that can ionize any particle in the atmosphere and make it detached from the gravitational field. Without the magnetosphere, the Earth's atmosphere including the ozone layer would be lost and make life on Earth unable to develop as complex as it is now. Earth's magnetic field reflects most of the solar wind, that is, a current of charged particles from the sun capable of ionizing the layers of the Earth's atmosphere. Gases exposed to the solar wind can be trapped in magnetic field bubbles that can be carried away by solar wind currents, a process that may have occurred on the planet Mars.

The word \"telegraph\" that is often heard today, is generally an electric telegraph. The telegraph was created by an American named Samuel F.B. Morse along with his assistant Alexander Bain. Messages on the telegraph are transmitted by telegraphers using morse code known as \"telegram\" or \"kabelgram\", and are often abbreviated as cable or wire messages. Before long-distance (interlocal) telephones were introduced and used, telegram was very well known for its use. Telegram is usually used for business purposes, and is not the same as email. Telegram is often used for the delivery of official documents in business agreements. The electric telegraph was first invented by Samuel Thomas von S\u00f6mmering in 1809. Then in 1832, Baron Schilling created the first electric telegraph. Carl Friedrich Gauss and Wilhelm Weber were the first to use the electric telegraph for fixed means of communication in 1833 in G\u00f6ttingen. The first commercial telegraph was created by William Fothergill Cooke and marketed on the Great Western Railway in England. This telegraph was patented in England in 1837. This telegram was sent at a distance of 13 miles/21 km from Paddington station to West Drayton and began operations on 9 April 1839. In 1843, a Scottish inventor, Alexander Bain, invented a device that was arguably the first facsimile machine. He called his invention the \"recording telegraph.\" The telegraph that Bain invented was able to transmit images using electric wire. In 1855, an Italian monk, Giovanni Caselli, also created an electric telegraph that could transmit messages.

The telegraph has been successfully used and accepted as a telegraph line between the cities of Paris and Lyon. An electric telegraph, first freely invented and patented in the United States in 1837 by Samuel F. B. Morse. His assistant, Alfred Vail, created a morse code that symbolizes letters with Morse. The first American telegraph was delivered by Morse on January 6, 1838 via 2 miles/3 km of wire at Speedwell Ironworks near Morristown, New Jersey. His message read \"A patient waiter is no loser\" and on May 24, 1844, he sent a \"What hath God wrought\" message from the Old Supreme Court Chamber at the Capitol in Washington to Mt. Clare Depot in Baltimore. The Morse/Vail telegraph was quickly deployed in the next 2 decades. Cross-atlantic cables began to be tried for use in 1857, 1858, and 1865. The cable in 1957 was operated only a few times. The first commercial telegraph cable capable of crossing the atlantic ocean was successfully completed on July 18, 1866. Australia was the world's first link in October 1872 via the underwater telegraph at Darwin. This has caused new news for the world. Further advances in telegraph technology occurred as early as 1870, when Thomas Edison invented the \"full duplex two-way telegraph\" and doubled its capacity by discovering the guadruplex in 1874. Edison registered it with the U.S. patentizer and the telegraph duplex was successfully patented on September 1, 1874. In early 1830, the electric telegraph developed with the use of electrical voltage to control electromagnets listened to at the ends of the transmission. The limitation of technology at that time was that the results of sending codes via cable could not be printed.

The condition can also make a person unable to taste food. So it can trigger loss of appetite, weight loss, malnutrition, and even depression. Anosmia is usually temporary, but there are also permanent ones. Anosmia is the loss of a person's ability to smell, either partially or completely. Another definition of anosmia is a disorder that occurs in the sense of smell. The term anosmia relates to hyposmia and hyperosmia. Hyposmia refers to a decrease in the sense of smell or a decrease in the ability to detect odors through the nose. While hyperosmiais the increased ability of the sense of smell. The main symptom of people who experience anosmia is the loss of their sense of smell. This can happen due to age or other factors. With age, a person's sense of smell will decrease. This can be the cause of anosmia in a person. Here are the possible reasons some people experience anosmia due to age factors: There are also cases of anosmia that occur due to genetic disorders (such as kallmann syndrome or congenital insensitivity to pain), the disorder is called congenital anosmia (congenital anosmia). Congenital anosmia usually occurs sporadically, although in some cases it can occur in a family or offspring. Until now the exact cause of congenital anosmia is still unknown, and also the way of treatment is still absent. The causes of irritation of the mucous membranes lining the nose include the following: Here are some of the conditions that cause blockage of the respiratory tract, including: In the human nose, there is a stinging nerve that functions as an excitatory receiver in the form of odor.

These types of diseases include Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and amiotrophic lateral sclerosis. Idiopathic anosmia is an anosmia that occurs in a person, but the cause of the occurrence of such anosmia is unknown. Anosmia or loss of sense of smell is one of the earliest and most commonly reported symptoms of COVID-19. In addition, in May 2020, anosmia was recognized as a symptom of COVID-19 based on the accumulation of existing evidence. This is supported by a meta-analysis that shows loss of sense of smell in 55% (with a confidence interval of 95%, 38%, up to 70%) of COVID-19 patients. However, the presence of symptoms of anosmia cannot be immediately diagnosed as COVID-19 without being accompanied by other diagnostic tests. In addition to experiencing anosmia, the symptoms of COVID-19 are also often accompanied by a disturbance of the taste buds (dysgeusia). Examples of taste buds disorders (dysgeusia) include salty, bitter mouth, or the presence of a metallic taste. Nonetheless, initially anosmia and dysgeusia were thought to be unrelated to COVID-19. This is because these symptoms only occur in 5% of the total COVID-19 patients from the first study by Mao et al conducted in China. However, studies conducted in North America, the Middle East, and the north have seen an increase in the prevalence of anosmia symptoms. The recommended treatment for COVID-19 patients who have olfactory disorders (anosmia) is to carry out corticosteroid therapy treatment.

The difference in concentration present in the two solutions is called the concentration gradient. Diffusion will continue to occur until all particles are evenly dispersed or reach a state of equilibrium in which the transfer of molecules persists even if there is no difference in concentration. A simple example is the administration of sugar to fresh tea liquid. Gradually the liquid becomes sweet. Another example is water vapor from kettles that diffuse in the air. The most frequent diffusion is molecular diffusion. This diffusion occurs if a displacement is formed from a layer of molecules that are stationary from a solid or fluid. There are several factors that affect the speed of diffusion, namely: In taking essential nutrient substances and excreting unnecessary substances, the cell performs various types of activities, and one of them is diffusion. There are two types of diffusion performed, namely ordinary diffusion and special diffusion. Diffusion usually occurs when cells want to take nutrients or molecules that are hydrophobic (non-polar / polarized). Molecules can directly diffuse into plasma membranes made of phospholipids. Such diffusion does not require energy or ATP (Adenosine Tri-Phosphate). Special diffusion occurs when a cell wants to take nutrients or molecules that are hydrophilic or polarized and ions. This kind of diffusion requires special proteins that provide pathways to these particles or assist in the transfer of particles. This is done because the particles cannot pass through the plasma membrane easily. These proteins that intervene in this particular diffusion usually serve for specific particles.

Baptism also symbolizes death with Jesus. By entering the water, the baptized person is symbolized as dead. When he came out of the water again, it was described as his resurrection. The Apostle Paul in the Epistle of Romans puts it this way: \"Or do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ have been baptized into His death? Thus we have been buried with him by baptism into death, that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, so shall we live in newness of life.\" (Romans 6:3-4) The word Baptism (derived from the Greek: \u03b2\u03b1\u03c0\u03c4\u03af\u03b6\u03c9, translit. baptizo) the origin of the word is the word \u03b2\u03ac\u03c0\u03c4\u03c9 - bapto, which means to drown.

Phospholipids consist of four components: Phospholipids have a glycerol skeleton and two acyl groups. In the third position of the glycerol skeleton is occupied by a phosphate group bound to the amino alcohol. The phospholipid molecule can be viewed as consisting of two parts, namely the head and the tail. The head part has a positive and negative charge and the tail part without a charge. The head part has a charge and is hydrophilic or soluble in water, while the tail part is hydrophobic or insoluble in water. Phospholipids are classified as amphipathic lipids and are neutral surfactants. The function of phospholipids includes as a constituent material for cell membranes. The cell membranes are composed of embedded proteins and fused with a double layer of phospholipid molecules. Lecithin and cephaline are types of phospholipids found in several parts of the body, such as the brain, nerve cells, and liver. The substance is also found in wheat sprouts, yeast and soybeans. Some of the biological functions of phospholipids include as a lung surfactant that prevents the attachment of the alveolus wall of the lungs during expiration. Phospholipids are one of the good emulsifying agents. In the food industry, for example mayonnaise, a phosphoglyceride from the yolk serves to keep vegetable oils emulsified with vinegar. Natural and synthetic phospholipids are also used in the manufacture of medicines, lubricants, liposome stabilizers, as well as in ingredients from cosmetics.

By definition, when a drug is administered intravenously, its bioavailability is 100%. However, when a drug is administered through another route of administration (e.g. peroral), in general its bioavailabilityTH\"] will decrease (since the drug is not fully absorbed and the metabolism is cross-first) or may vary from patient to patient. Bioavailability is very important in pharmacokinetics, one of the important things is that bioavailability must be taken into account in the calculation of doses for drug administration in addition to the intravenous route. For dietary supplements, herbs, and other nutrients whose general route of administration is almost all through peroral, bioavailability is only defined as the amount or fraction of the absorbed dose (not the one that enters the systemic circulation). The definition of bioavailability differs slightly between medicines and dietary supplements due to differences in the methods of administration and regulations of the Food and Drug Administration. Bioaccessibility is a concept related to bioavailability in the context of biodegradation and environmental pollution. A molecule (often a persistent organic pollutant) is said to be bioaccessible when \"the molecule can penetrate the cell membrane from the external environment, if the organism has access to the molecule.\" In pharmacology, bioavailability indicates a measurement of the rate and active ingredients or active parts that are absorbed from a medicinal product and available at the site of action. Bioavailability is denoted with the letter \"f\" (or, if in the form of percent, with F). The concept of bioavailability in nutrition science does not have standards related to the pharmaceutical industry. The definition of bioavailability from pharmacology does not apply to nutritional substances, because the absorption of these substances is influenced by the state of the body and the nutrients present in the patient's body, so there is a greater difference in values between one individual and another (variations between individuals). ", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "Therefore, bioavailability for dietary supplements can be defined as part of a given substance that is capable of being absorbed and can be used or stored. In both of these areas, bioavailability is measured by calculating the area under curve AUC of the drug concentration versus time graph. Absolute bioavailability is a comparison of the bioavailability of the active substance of the drug in systemic circulation in non-intravenous drug administration (such as oral, rectal, transdermal, subcutaneous, or sublingual administration), to the bioavailability of the same drug in intravenous or fractional administration of drugs absorbed in non-intravenous administration compared to drugs absorbed in intravenous administration. To make a comparison, should use the normal dosage. Therefore, the amount of absorbed drug is corrected in advance by dividing the value by the administered dose. In pharmacology, in order to be able to determine the absolute bioavailability of the drug, pharmacokinetic studies must be carried out to obtain a graph plot of drug consenstration in plasma vs time of the drug after administration via intravenous (iv) and extravascular (not intravenous, e.g. orally). To calculate absolute bioavailability can use the equation below. Therefore, drugs administered intravenously will have an absolute bioavailability of 100% (f=1), while drugs administered through other routes usually have an absolute bioavailability of less than one. If we want to compare two different doses with the same active substance and compare the bioavailability of the two drugs, then that comparison is called comparative bioavailability (comparative bioavailability). Although knowing the absolute bioavailability of a drug is very useful, the reality of this study is not often carried out. The reason is that to assess bioavailability requires data from intravenous administration which is the route of administration with the entire drug can go to systemic circulation.

Gorgonops are typical representatives of the Gorgonopsia group, the predators that dominated at the time, whose longest size could reach three meters. Gorgonops are medium-sized representatives of the group, with a skull length of 22 to 35 centimeters, depending on the species. Their length ranges from 1.2 to 2 meters from the muzzle to the tail. Gorgonops may have been one of the key predators that crossed southern Africa during the Late Permian, having large canines, perhaps they would have a bit of a problem when sticking their canines in the skin of some thick herbivorous animals at the time, particularly Pareiasauria such as Pareiasaurus. In addition to teeth, one of the key advantages of predators that Gorgonops has when preying on animals is that their legs support the body from below rather than the dilated posture of the legs like the animal that was its prey at the time. In addition to allowing for more energy-efficient movement, his legs also allow him to move much faster. The animals hunted also depend on the size of the Gorgonops individuals, and there are some differences in size between the existing species. Relative to body size, Gorgonops has a deep skull that has a triangular-shaped face when viewed from above. Perhaps the most distinguishing feature is two very large canines (12 cm long), almost protruding beyond the lower jaw.

The formation of the BKR was a change from the results of the PPKI session on August 19, 1945, which had previously planned the formation of a national army. The change was finally decided on August 22, 1945 not to form a national army. This decision was based on various political considerations. The leaders of the time chose to go the way of diplomacy to gain recognition of the newly proclaimed depravity. The Japanese occupation army, which was still heavily armed with a fallen mentality due to losing the war, became one of the considerations, too, to avoid clashes if a national army was directly formed. BKR members at that time were Indonesian youths who had previously received military education as Heiho soldiers, Defenders of the Fatherland (PETA), KNIL and so on. The central-level BKR headquartered in Jakarta is led by Moefreni Moekmin. Through a Government Proclamation dated October 5, 1945, BKR was changed to the People's Security Army (TKR) and after undergoing several name changes finally became the Indonesian National Army. On August 19, 1945, in the PPKI session, two PPKI members, Abikoesno Tjokrosoejoso and Otto Iskandardinata, proposed to establish a state defense agency. However, the proposal was rejected on the grounds that it could provoke clashes with the Japanese occupation army which was still fully armed and invited the intervention of allied soldiers who would disarm the Japanese army.

Around 1878, the Japanese government encouraged the development of cotton spinning as a prelude to the development of modern industry in Japan after the Meiji Restoration. Japan then experienced a shortage of raw cotton supplies, but at that time there was only one importer of raw cotton in Japan, so the industry was heavily dependent on foreign traders.

This process begins with hormonal signals from the brain to the gonads: ovaries in girls, testicles in boys. In response to such signals, the gonads produce hormones that stimulate libido and the growth, function, and transformation of the brain, bones, muscles, blood, skin, hair, breasts, and sex organs. Physical growth (height and weight) increases in the first half of puberty and is completed as the adult body has developed. Before puberty, the external sex organ known as the primary sexual trait is a sex feature that distinguishes men and women. Puberty leads to sexual dimorphism through the development of secondary sex characteristics, which further distinguish the sexes. On average, girls begin puberty at the age of 10-11 and end at the age of 15-17; Boys generally begin puberty at ages 11-12 and end at ages 16-17. The main marker of puberty for women is menarche, the first menstruation, which occurs on average between the ages of 12-13 years. In males, the first ejaculation on average occurs at the age of 13 years. In the 21st century, the average puberty age of children, especially girls, is lower than that of the 19th century, which is 15 years for girls and 16 years for boys. This can be caused by a number of factors, including increased nutrition resulting in rapid body growth, increased weight and fat buildup, or as a result of exposure to endocrine-disrupting substances such as xenoestrogens, which can sometimes be caused by the consumption of food or other environmental factors. Puberty that begins earlier than is usually known as early puberty, and puberty that begins later than is usually called delayed puberty. ", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "The most prominent characteristic among morphological changes in the size, shape, composition and functioning of the body of puberty, is the development of secondary sex characteristics, the \"replenishment\" of the child's body; from female to adult female, from male to adult male. The term puberty comes from the Latin puberatum (age of maturity), the word puberty describes the physical change towards sexual maturity, not the psychosocial and cultural maturity denoted by the term adolescent development in Western culture. Adolescence is a period of mental transition from childhood to adulthood, which overlaps with most periods of physical puberty. The two most significant differences between puberty in girls and puberty in boys are the age of onset, and the main sex steroids that affect it, androgens and estrogens. Although there are various normal age ranges, girls usually begin puberty around the age of 10\u201311 and end puberty around 15\u201317; Boys start around ages 11-12 and end around 16-17. Girls reach reproductive maturity about four years after the first physical changes appear. On the contrary, in boys it is precisely slower, but it continues to grow for about six years after the first visible change of puberty. Any increase in height beyond post-puberty age is rare. In boys, testosterone androgen is the primary sex hormone; While testosterone is produced, all male changes are characterized as virilization. A substantial product of testosterone metabolism in men is estradiol. The conversion of testosterone into estradiol depends on the amount of body fat and estradiol levels in boys are usually much lower than in girls. The male \"growth spurt\" also begins later, accelerates more slowly, and lasts longer before the epiphysis coalesces. Although boys are on average 2 cm (0.8 inches) shorter than girls before puberty begins, adult males are on average 13 cm (5.1 inches) taller than females.

In the era of the Mataram kingdom kingdom (Amangkurat II) this area was called Limbarawa. In the past, Ambarawa was once the capital of Semarang Regency. Ambarawa is also known for the historical events of Palagan Ambarawa. In this district there are several historical sites, including the Palagan Ambarawa Monument, the Ambarawa Railway Museum and Willem I Fort which is a famous historical tour. Ambarawa has a jagged railway line that connects the entire Central Java region to Yogyakarta through Magelang. The Semarang-Ambarawa-Magelang line operated until 1977. Now this line is the site of the Ambarawa Railway Museum. After the Proclamation of Indonesian Independence, fighting broke out in Ambarawa on 20 November 1945 between NICA and British forces and the army of the Republic of Indonesia. This event is known as Palagan Ambarawa. In the middle of Ambarawa there is a swamp known as Rawa Pening. The origin of the swamp according to geologist J. Van Bemellen, Rawa Pening is a tectonic lake basin, which occurs due to gravitational tectonic events, namely shifts due to heavy forces, which resulted in Mount Telomoyo Purba, known as Mount Soropati, being torn and producing the Klegung fault which is now no longer active. In prehistoric times, the east side of Mount Soropati shifted to the northeast, so the area between Mount Telomoyo and the Umbrellarong Mountains was depressed. As a result, part of the base leg is broken and folded, thus forming a basin filled with rainwater and producing many springs from the aquifer fault. This basin is known as the Pening Swamp. This swamp is the main source of water for the Tuntang River, which empties into the Java Sea. Ambarawa developed as a tourist city where various tours are available such as Kampung Rawa, Train Museum, Eling Bening and others.

He reigned in 1248 - 1268 entitled Sri Jayawisnuwarddhana Sang Mapanji Seminingrat Sri Sakala Kalana Kulama Dhumardana Kamaleksana (according to Maribong inscription, 1248). According to Pararaton, Vishnuwardhana's real name is Ranggawuni son of Anusapati son of Stump Ametung. In 1249 Anusapati was killed by a coup d'\u00e9tat by his younger half-brother, Tohjaya the son of Ken Arok of Ken Umang's concubine. In 1250 Tohjaya was instigated by his maid, Pranaraja, to remove his two nephews, Ranggawuni and Mahisa Campaka, who were considered dangerous enemies. Tohjaya then ordered his bodyguard, named Lembu Ampal to carry out the execution. The Ampal ox failed to carry out their duties because the two princes were protected by a palace employee named Panji Patipati. For fear of getting punishment from Tohjaya, Lembu Ampal chose to join Ranggawuni's group. The Ampal ox then carried out a fight in the body of the Singhasari army so as to create chaos. Unable to reconcile the riots, Tohjaya intended to sentence his army leaders to death. Hearing the decision, the officers immediately joined ranggawuni's group, of course at the invitation of Lembu Ampal. After receiving support from the army, Ranggawuni and Mahisa Campaka rebelled against Tohjaya's rule. Tohjaya was seriously injured and eventually died on the run in Katang Lumbang village. After the rebellion, Ranggawuni ascended the throne to become king of Tumapel (king of Singhasari) with the title of Vishnuwardhana, while Mahisa Campaka became Queen of Angabhaya (king of Kadiri) with the title Narasinghamurti. Mahisa Campaka is the son of Mahisa Wonga Teleng, or the grandson of Ken Arok. The joint rule between Vishnuwardhana and Narasingamurti was likened to two serpents in one burrow, and was intended to create peace between the Ametung Stump family and the Ken Arok family.

Nagarakretagama written in 1365 also mentions a joint government between Vishnuwardhana and Narasingamurti likened to Vishnu and Indra. But the difference is that Vishnuwardhana ascended the throne in place of Anusapati in 1248, not in place of Tohjaya in 1250. The news in Nagarakretagama that Vishnuwardhana ascended the throne in 1248 is evidenced by the discovery of the Maribong inscription. This inscription was issued by Vishnuwardhana on September 23, 1248. In 1250, after defeating Tohjaya, according to the inscription of Mula Malurung, Vishnuwardhana and Narasinghamurti son of Parameswara, reunited the Kingdom of Tumapel with Kadiri. This news is never mentioned in Pararaton or Nagarakretagama. Presumably after Ken Arok's death there was a split that caused Kadiri to separate from Tumapel. In addition, the Mula Malurung inscription (1255) also mentions that Tohjaya was not the king of Tumapel or Singhasari, but the king of Kadiri. In 1252, according to Nagarakretagama or Pararaton, Vishnuwardhana destroyed the \"Linggapati rebellion\" in Mahibit. In 1254 Vishnuwardhana inaugurated Singhasari as the capital of the Kingdom of Tumapel. Previously, the name of the capital of this kingdom was Kutaraja. Over time, the name of the Singhasari Kingdom was actually more popular than the Tumapel Kingdom. In 1254 Vishnuwardhana also appointed his son Kertanagara as viceroy (yuwaraja) in Kediri. In 1268, Vishnuwardhana abdicated, then succeeded by his son, Kertanagara. The news in Nagarakretagama that Kertanagara son of Vishnuwardhana ascended the throne in 1254 is proven to be false, because in the Mula Malurung inscription in 1255 Kertanagara was still serving as viceroy in Kadiri, while Tumapel or Singhasari remained led by Vishnuwardhana. Perhaps what Kertanagara meant to ascend to the throne in 1254 was as a yuwaraja (viceroy), not as a maharaja.

Tayt was the goddess of the Ancient Egyptian religion who dealt with weaving, textiles, as well as in a lower capacity, mummification. His role is similar to that of Hedjhotep. The name Taytet comes from a word meaning \"garment\". Other goddesses of Ancient Egyptian religion that dealt with weaving were Isis and Nephthys. Ancient Egyptians most often used linen cloth and thus Tayt often sewed or gave head cloth made from linen to gods or dignitaries. The statues of gods and goddesses were given high-quality linen clothing; and the linen is also considered sacred because of its quality and properties. Linen is created from the roots of the flax plant; The younger the plant from origin, the higher the quality of the linen product produced. Linen was able to protect the wearer and Tayt was later also considered a protective maternal figure. In the Pyramid Text, spell 738a, Tayt guards the pharaoh's head, and helps him to be favored by other gods. Working women and nobles in Ancient Egyptian society enjoyed sewing as a commercial activity. Cotton only later reached Egypt through the Roman Empire. Tayt was later associated with the burial of the remains because of his role in the use of gauze for mummification. Tayt was known as a goddess who \"woke up in peace\", and was associated with the gift of textiles to please the gods. As the goddess of burial of the remains, Tayt is featured in Part Five in the Book of Goa, which describes Ra's journey through the lower realms and his dealings with the cursed people.

The thing to know is that there is also the use of literary and literary terms. Literary segmentation refers more to its definition as merely a text. Meanwhile, literature is more about literature that has a strong poetic or abstract feel. The term literati is one example, defined as a person who is involved in literature, not literature. Because, a literati is a person who likes its poetic and abstract nuances, not just texts. In addition, in the literary sense, literature can be divided into written literature or oral literature (oral literature). Here literature has little to do with writing, but with language that is used as a vehicle for expressing certain experiences or thoughts. Sugiantomas, stated that literature is the result of human creative activities that are poured into the medium of language, both oral and written. A work of art can be said to be a work of literary value not only because the language is beautiful, square, full of rhythms and parables, but rather must be seen as a whole; from the aesthetic values, moral values, and conception values contained in the literary work.

The term \"documentary\" was first used in the film review Moana (1926) by Robert Flaherty, written by The Moviegoer, a pseudonym of John Grierson, in the New York Sun on February 8, 1926. In France, the term documentary is used for all non-fiction films, including films about travel and educational films. Based on this definition, the first films were all documentaries. They record everyday things, such as trains coming into stations.basically, documentaries represent reality. This means that documentary means re-showing the facts that exist in life. Box Office analysts have noted that this genre of films has become increasingly successful in theaters through films such as Super Size Me, March of the Penguins and An Inconvenient Truth. When compared to dramatic narrative films, documentaries are usually made on a much cheaper budget. This is quite attractive to film companies because only with a limited theatrical release can generate considerable profits. The development of documentary films has been quite rapid since the era of cinema verit\u00e9. Notable films such as Errol Morris's The Thin Blue Line stylized re-enactments, and Michael Moore's The Moore: Roger & Me put the director's much more interpretive control. In reality, the commercial success of these documentaries is probably due to a shift in narrative style in documentaries. This raises the debate over whether a film like this can really be referred to as a documentary; Critics sometimes refer to these kinds of films as Mondo Films or Docu-Ganda. After all, the manipulation of directing on documentary subjects has existed since the Flaherty era, and has become a kind of endemic to the genre.

Also emerging is the production of the documentary the making-of which presents the production process of a film or video game. Documentaries created with this promotional purpose are closer to advertising than classic documentaries. Modern lightweight digital video cameras and computerized editing have contributed greatly to documentary filmmakers, comparable to the low price of equipment. The first film made with the convenience of this facility was a documentary by Martin Kunert and Eric Manes: Voices of Iraq, in which 150 DV cameras were sent to Iraq throughout the war and distributed to Iraqis to record themselves.

In this sense, heresy is a view or doctrine in philosophy, politics, science, art, etc., that is different from what is generally recognized as an authoritative one.\" The word \"heresy\" comes from the Greek \u03b1\u03b9\u03c1\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2, hairesis (from \u03b1\u03b9\u03c1\u03b5\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9, haireomai, \"to choose\"), which means the choice of beliefs or factions of the resisting believers. This word was widely used by Ireneus in his chronicle Contra Haereses (Against Persecutors). He described his own position as orthodox (from ortho- \"straight\" + doxa \"thought\") and his position eventually evolved into the position of the inaugural Christian Church, from which the orthodox words came from. So, there is a presumption that \"heresy\" does not have a fully objective meaning. This category exists only as opposed to the position of a sect that has previously been defined as \"orthodox\". Thus, any non-conformist view in any field can also be considered \"heretical\" by others in that field who are convinced that their views are the \"right\" (orthodox). The heretics usually do not consider their beliefs heretical. Calling a teaching \"heretical\" is a judgment that is not value-free, because it is done from within an established belief system. For example, Roman Catholics consider Protestant teachings heretical, while non-Catholics consider Catholic teachings to be \"Great Apostasies.\" In order for a heretical ajarah to exist, there must first be an authoritative system of dogmas established as orthodox dogmas, as for example proposed by the Roman Catholic Church.

The variant view of orthodox Marxism-Leninism is described as a \"right faction\" or \"left deviation\". The Church of Scientology uses the term \"squirelling\" to refer to unauthorized changes to its teachings or methods. The use of the term heresy in the context of Christianity is rarely used today, with a few exceptions: for example Rudolf Bultmann and the debate over the ordination of female priests and gay priests. The popular view passed down \"heresy\" to the Middle Ages, at the height of church power in Europe, but the case of the scholar and humanist Giordano Bruno was not the last execution for heresy. Heresy is reminiscent of an official punishment in Roman Catholic countries until the end of the 18th century. In Spain, cases of heresy have been indicted and convicted throughout the Contra Enlightenment after the Napoleonic Era. Misdirection within the church actually has as old an age as the church itself. Since the days of Paul and John, after Christ ascended into heaven, various heretics have sprung up. The young early church had been confronted with various misleading doctrinal influences, and it will continue until the end of time. In the following centuries, the church faced various traditions such as: Marsionism, Montanism, Novatianis, Donatis, and so on. And so on. Thus, the church need not be surprised by the emergence of confusing and misleading teachings and traditions, but rather must be vigilant, and strengthen faith, the investigation of biblical truth and strengthen the relationship with God, the Head of the Church. Before looking at some of the starting points that are the basis for measuring the extent to which a teaching is of heretical value, Christians sometimes have misconceptions, including: A teaching is an understanding (which usually concerns the concept of life) that is conveyed to the wider party deliberately and planned.

When sad, human beings often become more silent, less excited, and withdrawn. Sadness can also be viewed as a temporary decrease in mood, while depression is often characterized by a persistent and large decrease in mood that is sometimes accompanied by a disturbance in one's ability to carry out one's daily activities. Crying is one indication of sadness. Sadness is the opposite of happiness or joy and is similar to sorrow or misery. Sadness is also one of the \"six basic emotions\" described by Paul Ekman, along with happiness, anger, surprise, fear, and disgust. Sadness can also be interpreted as a feeling or feeling where the inability to face existing problems and problems experienced. Prolonged sadness is bad for health, namely moist eyes and also dizziness when crying. Grief is a common experience in childhood. Sometimes, sadness can lead to depression. Some families may have a rule (consciously or unconsciously) that grief is not allowed, but Robin Skynner has suggested that this can cause problems, arguing that with grief \"filtered\", people can become superficial and manic. Pediatrician T. Berry Brazelton posits that acknowledging grief can make it easier for families to cope with more serious emotional problems. Grief is part of the normal process of the child being separated from the initial symbiosis with the mother and becoming more independent. Every time a child separates less, he has to face a small loss. If the mother cannot allow small hardships to be involved, the child may never learn how to deal with grief on his own. Brazelton argues that encouraging too much of a child disparages the emotion of grief for them and Selma Fraiberg suggests that it is important to respect a child's right to experience complete and deep loss.

Klenik is also associated with many things that cannot be digested with reason but are believed by many. Magical or klenic is a part that does not escape the traits and characteristics of Indonesian society. Since ancient times, in many Dutch records, Javanese people have been known for their belief in magical, occult, and clerical things. Launching O'Keefe in his theory, his book entitled Stolen Lightning: The Social Theory of Magic, published in New York in 1982, explains the social belief in magical things that develop in society. \"People's belief in magical or clerical things, can not only be found in the stone age, but even in every age, humans will always be closely related to things that are magical,\" writes Daniel O'Keefe. \"God not only created a universe inhabited by humans, animals, and plants, but also created spirits or jinns that cannot be captured with the naked eye,\" he added. This is what then underlies the collective thinking of the Indonesian people about the presence of magical and klenic.

The city was founded by residents of the greater Veneto region as a refuge from the Barbarian invasion, when the Western Roman Empire fell. During the Middle Ages, Venice slowly developed into an important commercial city. Around 1000 AD the Republic of Venice began to establish a kingdom in the eastern Mediterranean Sea that lasted until 1797, when it was annexed by Napoleon France. It then changed hands several times, becoming part of Austria twice, before becoming part of Italy during the unification of Italy. Venice greatly influenced the Venetian, Istrian, and Dalmatian coasts for a thousand years. Venice began to degenerate and lose population after the defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte, but with the unification of Italy the city regained its importance. In addition, Venice is also one of the most visited places by tourists from all over the world. The Sestieri is the main traditional division of Venice.

Its adherents are also referred to as Zoroastrians. It has a dualistic cosmology that separates good and evil, and an eschatology that predicts the ultimate conquest of evil by good. Zoroastrianism regards Ahura Mazda ('The Wise God') as a God who no longer begins as all-wise. Historically, the unique features of Zoroastrianism, such as monotheism, messianism, belief in free will, judgment by God after death, the concepts of heaven, hell, angels, and demons may have influenced systems from other religions and philosophies, including the Samawi Religions and Gnosticism, Northern Buddhism, and Greek philosophy. With possibly its roots in the 2nd millennia BC, Zoroastrianism entered written history as early as the 5th century BC. It served as the state religion in the Kingdoms of Ancient Iran for more than a millennium, from about 600 BC to 650 AD, but declined from the 7th century AD onwards as a direct result of the Muslim conquest of Persia (633-654 AD) leading to large-scale persecution of Zoroastrianism.

Zoroastrian religious philosophy separated the Gods from the early Iranian tradition into Ahura and Daeva, which Daeva considered unworthy of worship. Zoroaster states that Ahura Mazda is the supreme creator, the creative and sustaining energy of the universe through Asha, and that humanity is given the choice to choose whether to be on Ahura Mazda's side or not, making humanity responsible for the choices it makes. Although no one can fight Ahura Mazda in terms of strength, Angra Mainyu (destructive spirit), which was born from Aka Manah (evil mind), is considered the main enemy entity in religion, standing against Spenta Mainyu (creative spirit). Central Persian literature later further developed the character of Angra Mainyu into Ahriman, escalating him to become a major opponent of Ahura Mazda. In addition, the life energy derived from Ahura Mazda, known as Asha (truth, cosmic order), stands as opposed to Druj (lies, deceit). Ahura Mazda is considered the All-Good God with no hint of hatred or evil coming from him. Ahura Mazda is housed in G\u0113t\u012bg (visible material realm) and M\u0113n\u014dg (invisible mental and spiritual realm) through seven (six when without Spenta Mainyu) Amesha Spentas (direct emanation from Ahura Mazda).

Although the sea has been explored and explored since prehistoric times, modern scientific studies of the oceanographic sea only began during the expedition of HMS Challenger from Great Britain in the 1870s. The sea is generally divided into five large oceans covering the four oceans recognized by the International Hydrographic Organization (Atlantic, Pacific, Indian and Arctic Oceans) and the Southern Ocean. Due to continental drift, today the Northern Hemisphere has a more balanced ratio between land and sea area (about 2:3) than the Southern Hemisphere which is almost entirely oceanic (1:4,7). Salinity levels in the open ocean are generally worth about 3.5%, but variations can be found in waters more surrounded by land, near the mouths of large rivers, or at great depths. About 85% of the substances dissolved in the high seas are sodium chloride. Differences in salinity and temperature between sea areas give rise to thermohaline currents. The influence of the waves, produced by the wind and by the tides of the sea, gives rise to surface currents.

The fallopian tubes will carry the egg to the uterus. At this stage the hormone estrogen will provoke a thickening of the walls of the uterus. If fertilization does not occur (the meeting between the egg and the sperm cell), then the lining of the uterine wall will decay. Ovulation occurs during puberty and continues to take place every month during the fertile period of the female. Ovulation will stop temporarily at the time of pregnancy and will stop permanently during menopause. Each female has about 15-20 eggs on the ovary. The ready egg will be transferred into the fallopian tube and sent to the uterus to be fertilized. When the egg in this cycle is not fertilized, estrogen and progesterone levels will decrease. This causes the prepared lining of the uterine wall to decay. The decayed lining of the uterine wall will come out through the vagina in the form of blood, uterine tissue lumatan, and mucus. This phase lasts for 4 - 6 days, but some women can experience more than 6 days. In the follicular or preovulation phase that occurs on the first day of menstruation occurs the process of maturation of the follicles on the ovaries. In this stage, the ovary produces follicles containing ovum cells or eggs. The growth of mature follicles then triggers a spike in estrogen which causes the endometrium to get thicker. This phase occurs on the 10th day of 28 days of a menstrual cycle, and lasts for 11-27 days with an average of 16 days.

The cumulus-oocyte (coc) will leave a follicle rupture, move into the peritoneal cavity through the stigma, and be caught by the fimbriae at the end of the fallopian tube (also called oviduk). After entering the oviduk, the ovum-cumulus is pushed together by the cilia, and becomes the beginning of its journey in the direction of the uterus. After the oocyte completes the meiosis phase, it will produce two cells, namely the larger cell in the form of a secondary oocyte containing all the cytoplasmic material, and the smaller inactive cell first of the polar body. Then, the meiosis II stage will follow simultaneously, but will be stuck in the metaphase phase and left behind until fertilization. The spindle of the apparatus of the second division of meiosis appears at the time of ovulation. If fertilization does not occur, the oocyte will degenerate by 12 to 24 hours after ovulation. This phase represents the final phase of the living follicles. Without oocytes, the follicular fold enters itself and then transforms into the corpus luteum which is a steroidogenic cluster of cells that produce the hormones estrogen and progesterone. This hormone causes the endometrial glands to initiate proliferative endometrial production and then perform endometrial secretion, the embryo's growth site if implantation occurs. The action of progesterone increases basal body temperature to a quarter to 2.4 degrees Celsius (one-second to one degree Fahrenheit). The corpus luteum continues to perform this paracrine procedure for the rest of the menstrual cycle to maintain the endometrium before disintegration into scar tissue during menstruation.

This city is located about 130 km southwest of Surabaya City and is the third largest city in East Java province after Surabaya City and Malang City by population. Kediri City is the oldest city in East Java. Kediri City has an area of 63.40 km\u00b2 and its entire area is an enclave of Kediri Regency. Kediri City is divided by the Brantas River which extends from South to North for 7 kilometers. The population of this city is 287,962 people, based on data from the Central Statistics Agency for Kediri City in 2022. Kediri is known to be the main trading center for sugar and the largest cigarette industry in Indonesia. In this city too, the Gudang Garam kretek cigarette factory stood up and developed. In 2010, Kediri was named Indonesia's first rank, namely Most Recommended City for Investment based on a survey by SWA assisted by Business Digest, a research business unit of the SWA group. Archaeological artifacts discovered in 2007 show that the area around Kediri became the location of the Kadiri Kingdom, a Hindu-Buddhist kingdom in the 11th century. According to Serat Calon Arang, the beginning of the Kediri area as an urban settlement began when king Airlangga moved the center of his royal government from the Kahuripan palace to Dahanapura. (\"City of Fire\") hereinafter better known as Daha. located in the Kediri area. After Airlangga's death, the Panjalu area was divided into two, namely Kediri in the west and Jenggala in the east. Daha became the seat of government of the Kadiri Kingdom and Kahuripan became the seat of government of the Janggala Kingdom. Panjalu by later period writers is also referred to as the Kadiri / Kediri Kingdom, with an area approximately Kediri Regency until the present Madiun Regency.

Kediri fell to the VOC as a consequence of the Chinatown Geger. East Java at that time was controlled by Cakraningrat IV, the duke of Madura who sided with the VOC and wanted the freedom of Madura from Kasunanan Kartasura. Since Cakraningrat IV had his wishes rejected by the VOC, he rebelled. His rebellion was defeated by the VOC, assisted by Pakubuwana II, sunan Kartasura. As payment, Kediri became a part controlled by the VOC. Dutch rule over Kediri continued until the Indonesian War of Independence. The development of Kediri City into swapraja began when the Kediri Residency or Gemeente Kediri was inaugurated on April 1, 1906 based on Staasblad (State Gazette) no. 148 dated March 1, 1906. Gemeente is the seat of the Resident of Kediri with a limited autonomous government and has a Gemeente Raad (\"City Council\"/DPRD) of 13 people, consisting of eight European and equal groups (Europeanen), four Indigenous people (Inlanders) and one Foreign Easterner. In addition, under Staasblad No. 173 dated March 13, 1906, a financial budget of f. 15,240 was established in one year. It was not until November 1, 1928 that based on Stbl No. 498 of January 1, 1928, Kediri City became \"Zelfstanding Gemeenteschap\" (\"swapraja city\" with full autonomy). Kediri during the Independence Revolution of 1945-1949 became one of the guerrilla route points of the Commander-in-Chief General Sudirman. Kediri also recorded a dark history also during the era of the PKI G30S Uprising because many Kediri residents were also victims. The area of Kediri City is 63.40 km\u00b2 or (6,340 ha) and is a medium city in East Java Province.

Soewondo Air Base was previously an international airport under the name Polonia that served flights to major cities in Indonesia such as Jakarta, Batam, Malaysia (Kuala Lumpur, Penang, Ipoh), Singapore and Thailand (Bangkok). The renaming of Polonia International Airport to Soewondo Air Base was inaugurated on July 25, 2013, along with the transfer of civil aviation activities to Kuala Namu International Airport. Now as Soewondo Air Force Base, the airport is owned by the Air Force. The airport will be the headquarters of the Western Surveillance Wing, including eight CN-235 tactical surveillance aircraft. The name Polonia comes from the name of the country of origin of its builders, Poland (Polonia is a \"Polish\" name in Latin). Before it became an airport, the area was a plantation owned by a Polish named Michalski. In 1872 he received a concession from the Dutch Government to open a tobacco plantation on the East Coast of Sumatra, precisely the Medan area. Then he named the area after Polonia. In 1879 for some reason, the concession on the plantation land changed hands to Deli Maatschappij (Deli MIJ) or NV Deli Airlines. In 1924 there was news that a pioneering Dutch aviator named Thuessink van der Hoop]] would fly his small Fokker aircraft from Europe to the Dutch East Indies within 20 hours of flying. So Deli MIJ, which holds the concession on the land, provided a piece of land to be handed over as the first airfield in Medan.

After the first plane landed in Medan, the East Sumatra Resident Mr.CS. van Kempen urged the Dutch East Indies government in Batavia, to speed up the dropping of funds to complete the construction of the Polonia airfield. In 1928 the Polonia airfield was officially opened, marked by the landing of six aircraft belonging to KNILM, a subsidiary of KLM, on a still-emergency runway, in the form of hardened ground. Starting in 1930, the Dutch airline KLM and its subsidiary KNILM opened a regular flight network to Medan. In 1936 Polonia airfield for the first time made repairs, namely the creation of a 600-meter runway. In 1940, the Japanese bombarded the airport because it was used by the Dutch Air Force. After the bombing the airport was temporarily out of function. Only in 1946, the Dutch improved and rebuilt it with a number of changes. The runway is paved with concrete, fitted with iron, and extended from 800 meters to 1,200 meters. In 1950, Polonia Airfield was under the management of KLM and Garuda, the Public Works Service of the Airfield Section, and the General Engineering Service of the Republic of Indonesia Air Force. At that time, the Polonia runway was extended again to 1,800 meters and a width of 45 meters. Based on the provisions of the Government of the Republic of Indonesia, since 1959 the management of the airport has been handled by two agencies, namely AURI and the Civil Aviation Office. Since then, the runway has been extended to 2,455 meters to support the needs of the two agencies. Meanwhile, the management of the airfield management began to be controlled by graduates of the Indonesian Aviation Academy Curug. In 1963, the Civil Aviation Office was changed to the Directorate of Civil Aviation under the Ministry of Transportation.

The company has more than 12 stores in Japan and 4 outlets outside Japan. Takashimaya was a member of the International Association of Department Stores from 1962 to 1997. Takashimaya was ranked 1197th on the Forbes Global 2000 list in 2006. Takashimaya is a member of the Keiretsu Sanwa Group. Takashimaya's first movement opened in Kyoto in 1831 as a business owned by Shinshichi Iida, a merchant from an area that is now part of Fukui Prefecture. The outlet was originally only 3.6 square meters and mainly sold gofuku (formal kimono). A second store opened in Kyoto in 1893, followed by stores in Tokyo in 1897 and Osaka in 1898. In 1909, Takashimaya was registered as a gomei kaisha, and was later changed to kabushiki kaisha in 1919. After the Meiji Restoration, in 1876, Takashimaya began exporting its products outside Japan, and in 1887, Takashimaya established a trading unit. By 1903, Takashimaya had offices in Paris and London, as well as export offices in Yokohama. In 1913, the trading unit of Takashimaya was officially spun off into a separate company under the name Takashimaya-Iida (\u9ad8\u5cf6\u5c4b\u98ef\u7530\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e). Takashimaya-Iida then joined Marubeni. In the early 1930s, Takashimaya expanded massively. In 1931, Takashimaya opened a \"10, 20, and 50-cent store\" in Osaka, the predecessor of the current 100 yen store. In 1932, Takashimaya opened a flagship store in Namba, Osaka, and in 1933, Takashimaya opened a second-seeded store in Nihonbashi, Tokyo. ", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "In 1945, Takashimaya stores in Tokyo and Osaka were damaged by bombing, but were not destroyed, so they could still function as logistics centers during the Allied occupation of Japan. In accordance with post-war rules regarding new store sizes, a number of Takashimaya stores that opened starting in the 1950s, such as in Yokohama and Yonago, were established as a separate company. In 1958, Takashimaya opened a store in New York City, eventually occupying a 37,000-square-meter space at No. 693 Fifth Avenue. In 2010, the store in New York closed, as Takashimaya decided to focus on East Asia and Southeast Asia. In 1969, Takashimaya opened Japan's first American-style suburban shopping mall, at Futako-Tamagawa Station, southwest of Tokyo. In the 2000s, Japan's department store industry consolidated, due to declining revenues. Isetan Mitsukoshi Holdings (the parent of Mitsukoshi and Isetan) also became the largest player in the Japanese department store industry, followed by J. Front Retailing (the parent of Daimaru Matsuzakaya Department Stores). In 2008, Takashimaya announced plans to merge with H2O Retailing, the parent company of Hanshin Department Store and Hankyu Department Store. The merger will also form the largest department store operator in Japan. Takashimaya and H2O then entered into a cross-ownership relationship, acquiring 10% of the shares each. But in 2010, Takashimaya and H2O announced the cancellation of the merger between the two. In 2019, Takashimaya announced that it would close its Shanghai store on August 25, 2019, but the plan was later cancelled, as Takashimaya had the support of the local government.

", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "J is the tenth letter in the Latin alphabet, and the last letter to be supplemented in the 26-letter circle. His name in Indonesian is je. J is originally another form of the letter I, while the letter I comes from the Greek letter iota. The lowercase form j was used in the Middle Ages to end the Roman numeral in place of i. Different uses are prefixed in Upper Middle German. Peter Ramus (d. 1572) became the first person to clearly distinguish I and J as symbols of different sounds. Initially, the two letters I and J symbolized /i/, /i\u02d0/, and /j/; but the Romance language family developed new sounds (from /j/ and /g/) that became the symbolic sounds of I and J; therefore, the English J (from French J, and eventually used in Indonesian) is somewhat different in sound from j (info). All Germanic languages except English, Scottish and Luxembourg use J for /j/; as well as in Albanian, as well as Ural and Slavic language families that use the Roman alphabet, such as Hungarian, Finnish, Estonian, Polish, Czech, and Slovak. Some languages in this family, such as Serbian, also absorbed J into the Kiril alphabet for the same purpose. Therefore, its lowercase letter was chosen as the phonetic symbol of the IPA for j (info) (like the \"y\" in \"yes\"). The use of J as a symbol of the post-tooth friction consonant (/d\u0292/) is found in Igbo, Indonesian, Malay, Shona, Somali, Oromo and Zulu. English uses it on some words, for example the word jam (pronounced d\u0361\u0292\u00e6m]). In Basque, diaphonemes denoted by j are pronounced differently according to dialects: j], \u029d], \u025f], \u0292], \u0283], x] (the latter commonly used in Pa\u00eds Vasco). In Indonesian, J originally symbolized /j/, an almost palate consonant. ", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "Since 1972, the sound has been replaced with Y and the letter J is used to symbolize /d\u0292/. In the standard spelling of modern Italian, only words from Latin, self-names (such as Jesi, Letojanni, Juventus, etc.) or words from foreign languages used J. Until the 19th century, J tended to be used rather than I in diphthongs, in place of the suffix -ii, and in vowel groups (as in the word Savoja); This rule is quite strict in the official spelling guidelines. J is also used to absorb the sound /j/ in dialects, e.g. ajo in Romanesque becomes aglio (\u2013/\u028e/\u2013). Italian novelist Luigi Pirandello used J on vocal groups in his works written in Italian; he also wrote his mother tongue, Sicilian while retaining the use of J. In Spanish, J represents /x/ or /h/ (which evolved from the string consonant /d\u0292/), similar to the Indonesian \"h\" or \"kh\" sound. In French, Portuguese and Romanian, the letter J originally read /d\u0292/ but has now changed to /\u0292/ (as in the English word measure). In Turkish, Azerbaijani and Tatar, the letter J generally symbolizes the sound /\u0292/. \"J\" is the only letter not found in the periodic system of elements (but Jl was once used to represent joliotium, and J itself was once used for iodine).

colony located in New France in northeastern North America that included the territory of eastern Quebec, the Maritime Provinces, and the modern Maine region until it reached the Kennebec River. In the early 17th and early 18th centuries, Norridgewock on the Kennebec River and Castine at the end of the Penobscot River were the southernmost settlements in Acadia. For the French government, the Acadia region refers to the region bordering the Atlantic Ocean coast, more or less located between the 40th and 46th northern parallels. The population in Acadia includes members of the Wabanaki Confederation and descendants of immigrants from France. These two communities intermarried, so many people in Acadia became M\u00e9tis. The first capital of Acadia founded in 1605 was Port-Royal. British forces from Virginia attacked and burned the town in 1613, but it was later rebuilt nearby, where it stood as the capital of Acadia until the Siege of Port Royal in 1710. In its history, the Acadia region has experienced six colonial wars. Acadia was officially conquered by the British in 1710 during the War of Queen Anne, but the territory of New Brunswick and most of the Maine region is still contested. The islands of Prince Edward and Cape Breton remained controlled by France under Article XIII of the Treaty of Utrecht. The Maine region then fell to the British during the War of Father Rale. After the Romo Le Loutre War, the territory of New Brunswick was captured by the British. In the end, Prince Edward and Cape Breton Islands were controlled by the British in 1758 during the French and Indian Wars. Today the Acadian region refers to a region in North America that has historically been associated with the territory, ancestry, or culture of this former French colony.

Mass production of berets began in the 19th century in France and Spain, countries that remained related. Berets are commonly worn as part of many uniforms of military and police units around the world, as well as by other organizations. The practicality of the beret has long made it one of the items of clothing of military uniforms and other uniforms. Among some notable historical examples are the Scottish army, which wore blue hats in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the Volontaires Cantabres, a French army that grew up in the Basque country in the 1740s to 1760s, also wearing blue berets, and the Carlism rebels, with their red berets, in the 1830s in Spain. More recently, in the 1950s U.S. Army Special Forces units began wearing green berets as head coverings, which were officially adopted in 1961 with the unit becoming known as \"Green Berets\", and additional special forces in the Army, U.S. Air Force and other forces also adopted berets as typical headgear. Berets are also part of old stereotypes for scholars, film directors, artists, \"hipsters\", poets, and hippies. A beret was worn by artist Rembrandt and composer Richard Wagner. In the United States and England, in the mid-twentieth century there was an explosion in the use of berets in women's fashion. In the latter part of the twentieth century, the beret was adopted by the Chinese both as a fashion statement and for its political overtone. \"Guerrillero Heroico\", one of the most famous photos of the Argentine revolutionary figure, Che Guevara, shows him wearing a black beret with a brass star.

The expansion of the Jawa Pos group into the broadcasting industry has begun since 1999, when the government opened permits for the establishment of new national private television. In that year, Jawa Pos participated in the tender for the establishment of private television, under PT Jawa Media Televisi Mandiri (JMTV). Despite failing to obtain the permit, the group continued its efforts to enter the television business by in 2001 establishing JTV based in Surabaya, as a regional-based television network. The expansion then continues to be carried out so that the Jawa Pos Group has many local television stations in various regions, such as Riau TV, Batam TV, Padang TV, PJTV, PALTV, Fajar TV, TVTPI, and others. To consolidate all local television stations owned by this group, in 2007 Jawa Pos Multimedia Corporation / JPMC was established (under the company name PT Jawa Pos Multimedia), which at that time already had 15 local television stations in various regions. Initially, local televisions under Jawa Pos did not have shared/networked broadcasts (from the center), and were only united by the same parent. Only on August 17, 2015, the group launched its networked broadcasts under the name Jawa Pos TV, some of whose shows were relayed by local television stations owned by the Jawa Pos Group.

Nefertari means 'beautiful companion' and Meritmut means 'Lover of the goddess] Mut'. She was one of Egypt's most famous queens, alongside Kleopatra, Nefertiti, and Hatshepsut. He was highly educated and able to read and write hieroglyphs, a skill that was very rare at the time. He used this skill in his diplomatic work, in keeping with other prominent nobles of the time. His magnificent tomb, QV66, is one of the largest and most spectacular tombs in the Queen's Valley. Ramesses also built a temple for him in Abu Simbel next to his colossal monument there. Nefertari has many titles, including: Great of Praises (wrt-hzwt), Sweet of Love (bnrt-mrwt), Lady of Grace (nbt-im3t), Great King's Wife (hmt-niswt-wrt), His Beloved (hmt-niswt-wrt meryt.f), Lady of The Two Lands (nbt-t3wy), Lady of All Lands (hnwt-t3w-nbw), Wife of the Strong Bull (hmt-k3-nxt), God's Wife (hmt-ntr), Mistress of Upper and Lower Egypt (hnwt-Shm'w-mhw). Ramesses II also gave him the nickname 'The one who is illuminated by the sun'. Although Nefertari's family background is unknown, the discovery of the Pharaoh Ay coat of arms engraving on the knob found in his tomb raises the suspicion that Nefertari has a family relationship with him. The time between the leadership of Ay and Ramesses II shows that Nefertari cannot be Ay's daughter, and even if there is a blood relationship, Nefertari may be his great-granddaughter. There is no definitive evidence to suggest that Nefertari was related by blood to the royal family in the 18th dynasty. Nefertari married Ramesses II before she ascended the throne.

Other daughters named Bak(et)mut, Nefertari, and Nebettawy are also considered to be Nefertari's other daughters, but there is no definitive evidence to suggest they were related by blood. Nefertari first appears as Ramesses II's wife in a scene in the reliefs that tells of Ramesses II's first year enthroned. At the tomb at Nebwenenef, Nefertari is depicted as being behind her husband when Ramesses II appointed Nebwenenef to be High Priest of Amun while visiting Abydos. Nefertari also appears in the scene after 1 year stela. He is depicted shaking two sistras in the presence of Taweret, Thoth, and Nut. Nefertari appears twice as one of the royal women who is next to the giant statue of Ramesses II, which is in front of the temple.

This city includes 3 sub-districts, namely Atambua City District, West Atambua District, and South Atambua District. Atambua is the second largest city on the island of Timor in terms of economy, population, government and so on. Most of the people speak Tetun Belu and Bunaq and Kemak. Atambua is a multi-ethnic city of Timorese, Rote, Sabu, Flores, a small number of Chinese tribes and migrants from Ambon, Bugis Makassar and several other ethnic groups. But despite the diversity of ethnic groups, the residents of Atambua City still get along well living their social lives. The city, which is located in the West Timor area, was one of the refugee shelter centers from East Timor in 1999. The majority of the population of Atambua City is Catholic, of which Atambua is also a Diocese. The Diocese of Atambua is one of the dioceses in Indonesia whose percentage of Catholics is 95% of the total population. The territory of the Diocese of Atambua covers the entire territory of Belu Regency, Malacca Regency, and North Central Timor Regency. The total area of the diocese reached 5200 km2 and had a population of about 650,000 thousand inhabitants in 2008. Meanwhile, Belu, in Tetun language means friend or friend. The name \"Atambua\" comes from the word Ata which means servant and Buan which means suanggi. So Atambua means that the place of suanggi servants who are said to be in this area was used by the kings as a dumping ground for suanggi who disturbed the community. Later in its development the word Atabuan underwent the insertion of the phoneme \"M\". This could have happened accidentally because the phonemes \"B\" and \"M\" still have the same articulation point so as to maintain the smoothness of speech.citation needed] On 8 March 1942 the Dutch army command in Indonesia surrendered unconditionally to the Japanese.

Pathet gives the beauty and harmonization of gamelan punches. Each pathet has its own sequence of notes that are different from one another. In the puppetry performance pathet gives a sign of the time and the scene in progress. The restriction of tone and its setting contains philosophical meaning in Javanese culture, especially in wayang performance. In wayang performances in Surakarta, three pathets are generally known, namely, nem, sanga, and manyura. According to the type, there are generally several pathets for pelog and slendro barrels. The types of pathets in the slendro barrel are as follows: While the pathet for the pelog barrel is as follows : Each pathet becomes a time mark of a puppet show in progress. Pathet nem is used to open the puppet show which starts at 21:00. Pathet nem slices the palace scene up to the war scene at 24:00 After the war scene until the ascetic scene is used pathet sanga. Pathet sanga ends at 03:00. The puppet show ends with the pathet Manyura. The successive presentation of accompaniment and gamelan instruments from pathet nem, sanga, and manyura forms a dramatic groove of the musical uphill. Pathet nem occupies the lowest position, pathet sanga is in the middle, and pathet manyura is in the highest position. Pathet nem supports early scenes which are introductions. Then the scenes of the problem are accompanied by the music of the sanga pathet. Pathet manyura accompanies the climactic scenes to the resolution of the problem. So the connection between pathet and art is to build a dramatic plot of the story in puppetry. Pathet also adapts to the characters' conversations.

This activity of cleansing the scalp and hair is called shampooing. At the time of shampooing, individuals are considered to perform treatment by washing their hair and scalp to be clean of oil, dust, skin flakes, and other impurities that stick to the hair along with the activities they do. In its scientific sense, shampoo is defined as that is, a preparation that contains surfactants in a suitable and useful form to remove impurities and fats that adhere to the hair and scalp so as not to harm the hair, scalp and health of the wearer. Shampoos are generally used by mixing them with water with the aim of dissolving the natural oils secreted by the body to protect the hair and wash away the adhering impurities. However, not all shampoos are liquid or used with a mixture of water, there are also dry shampoos in the form of powders that do not use water. This dry shampoo, in addition to being used by humans, is more commonly used for pets such as cats that do not like to come into contact with water or dogs. Some industries that produce shampoo or hair care generally also release conditioner products with the aim of making it easier for shampoo users to rearrange their hair. In English, the term Shampoo was used in 1762 meaning \"massaging,\" from the Anglo-Indian shampoo, from Hindi champo, an imperative form of champna meaning \"pressing, squeezing muscles\". The shampoo that was later interpreted as \"washing hair\" was first recorded in 1860, and in 1866 it was first recorded as a \"cleaning with the use of shampoo\" activity; Then in 1954 the meaning was expanded to the use of carpets, furniture, and so on.

In Indonesia in ancient times, shampoo was made from merang which was burned to ashes and mixed with water. Shampoo for babies is made in such a way that it does not sting in the eyes. Shampoos for animals can also contain insecticides to kill fleas.citation needed] Some human shampoos cannot be used for animals because they contain zinc (e.g. anti-dandruff shampoos).citation needed] This metal is not toxic to humans, but is harmful to animals.citation needed]. In addition, there is also shampoo in solid form, which is more compact and easy to carry but less practical for long hair.citation needed] There are shampoos that are made specifically for hair that is dyed or colored or permed because the hair suffers enough with the introduction of chemical liquids to the roots of the hair and this can affect the health condition of the hair. This type of shampoo is softer so it is suitable for hair that has gone through a chemical process. Shampoos for thorough cleaning (English: clarifying shampoo) usually contain acids or acids obtained from apples, lemons or vinegar that serve to remove residues or residues of care products such as creambath, foam for hair (foam), hairspray, hair wax (wax), hair jelly (gel), and other products that remain on the scalp. This type of shampoo is very suitable for use when the hair is going through a chemical process so that the hair and scalp are completely clean with the aim that the chemical process used in curling or dyeing can be absorbed properly.

He built at least three pyramids before his successor built the Giza pyramids. He was famous during Ancient Egypt although in modern times, his pyramids were not visited by as many tourists as the pyramids in Giza. Snefru was the first king to mark the 4th dynasty of ancient Egypt, which Manetho said ruled for 29 years (2613-2589 BC). Manetho was an Egyptian priest, who lived in the third century BC, who grouped the kings of the Egyptian dynasty into 31 dynasties. Manetho's schematics also have defects, but, modern experts conventionally follow his method of grouping. The Prisse Papyrus, the source of the Middle Kingdom, supports the fact that King Huni was indeed the predecessor of Snefru. It says \"the king of Upper and Lower Egypt, Huni arrived at the resting place (died), and the paduka of the king of Upper and Lower Egypt, Snefru, rose as the most gracious king in all the pejuru of this land...\" Aside from Sneferu's successor, we learned from this paper that later people would still consider him a \"gracious\" ruler. This idea may just be the root word of the etymology of the king's name, which can be interpreted as infinitive \"making beautiful.\" It is doubtful whether Huni is Sneferu's father or not.

Born in Lugdunum in Gaul (now Lyon) to Drusus and Antonia Minor, he was the first Roman emperor born outside of Italy. In the era of his rule, there was a Roman conquest of Britain. Claudius was born in 10 BC in the city of Lugdunum in Gaul (Lyons, modern France). His mother was Antonia Minor, the youngest daughter of Marcus Antonius with Octavia, and his father was Drusus, the younger brother of Tiberius. Because his mother was the nephew of the emperor Augustus, Claudius was related to Augustus, and his uncle Tiberius would become emperor, so Claudius was already an important person even as a child. He had an older sister and an older brother, Germanicus (who later became Caligula's father). Claudius' father died suddenly when Claudius was 1 year old, so Claudius was eventually taken care of by his mother Antonia and his grandmother Livia. They hired the historian Livius to teach him history. Claudius had a disability, so his mother felt that he would not be able to become a politician. She stuttered, her head trembled, her knees weak, she moved haphazardly when she was ecstatic. He may suffer from a rare disease called \"Wilson's Disease\", which drives people crazy - Caligula may also suffer from the same disease. It could also be that Claudius suffered from cerebral palsy.

He often reads books, and writes historical and scientific works. So Augustus, Tiberius, and Caligula didn't pay much attention to him, and they didn't kill him when they killed most of their relatives. Claudius himself also admitted, that he often exaggerated his illness to save his life. But in 37 AD, when Claudius was 46 years old, Caligula decided to appoint him as consul. Perhaps he wanted to remind the people that they used to like Caligula's father, Germanicus who was Claudius' older brother. Caligula often made fun of and played tricks on Claudius, and made Claudius suffer. But the people became more attentive to Claudius. Four years later when Caligula was assassinated, the people realized that Claudius was the only surviving descendant of Augustus and a surviving member of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, so he was made emperor by the Praetorian Guard. Claudius was then 50 years old. He was found hiding behind a curtain at the time of Caligula and his family's murder. The people may not have had much hope for him, but it turned out that Claudius ruled well - his disability did not prevent him from being an intelligent man. Claudius made the Roman Empire wider by sending troops to conquer Britain (modern Britain), and by political takeovers in various places, namely: Thrace, Noricum, Pamphylia, Lycia and Judea (modern Israel). He also made the court system fairer, although he was easily persuaded and sometimes unable to be as fair as he would like. He also gave more rights to the slaves and women.

Hokusai is considered one of the important figures in the field of ukiyo-e (literally: \"painting today\") or paintings themed around everyday life. Hokusai is also famous for its erotic images in the shanga style. His \"Fukujus\u014d\", a series of 12 images celebrating the majesty of the body and passion, is considered one of the three best shunga works. His work served as a perceptive inspiration for European impressionists such as Claude Monet. Katsushika Hokusai is generally more valued in Western culture than in Japan. Many works of Japanese painters were imported to Europe in the 19th century and collected by artists such as Claude Monet, Edgar Degas, and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, whose works show influences from Japan.

Some people suspect that a strong-minded queen in unconventional politics and religion may not only be because she has a strong character, but rather because she is of foreign descent. Tiye also had a brother named Anen, who was the Second Prophet of Amun. Egyptian scientists speculate that Ay was the heir of Tutankhamen as pharaoh after the death of his predecessor who was also likely a descendant of Tiye. No clear date or monument can confirm the relationship between the two, but ancient Egypt considered the origin of Ay, who was also from Akhmin, and because he inherited part of Tiye's father's title Yuya, held during his lifetime, in the Amenhotep III court.

Compared to soap, detergents have the advantage of having better washing power and not being affected by water hardness. In general, detergents contain the following ingredients: Surfactants (surface active agents) are surface active substances that have different ends, namely hydrophiles (like water) and hydrophobia (like fat). This active ingredient functions to lower the surface tension of the water so that it can release dirt that sticks to the surface of the material. Basically, surfactants have ionic properties (electric charge) and are categorized into three types of surfactants, namely: 1.Anionic Surfactants Anionic surfactants carry negative charges so that they react with positively charged ions in hard water. To note, hard water contains magnesium and calcium compounds. Anionic surfactants react with compounds in hard water to then neutralize them. 2. Cationic Surfactants Anionic surfactants carry a negative charge so that they react with positively charged ions in hard water. To note, hard water contains magnesium and calcium compounds. Anionic surfactants react with compounds in hard water to then neutralize them. 3.Nonionic Surfactants Since nonionic surfactants have no charge, they do not undergo ionization in water. This type of surfactant helps to clean oily stains through an emulsification process. The builder is a key component that can help the surfactant work more optimally. This booster or builder works in reducing calcium and magnesium ions so that the detergent can clean properly. Sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP) is an example of a widely used booster. STTP is also able to maintain an alkaline condition when washing dirt grease, is able to protect the washing machine from rust, and helps hold dirt in the washing water so that it does not stick back to clothes.

The title can also refer to monarchical rulers whose ranks are subordinate to kings and sultans. In Indonesian, the title for women who are on an equal footing with the prince is princess, it can be used for female descendants of monarchical rulers or wives of princes. Prince comes from the Old Javanese language which means protector. This stems from Dewanata's belief that the nobles are the incarnations of God Almighty who descended on earth. The expression \"prince\" comes from the word ngher, which means to protect. In Indonesian, the title of prince is more synonymous with the title for the male descendants of the monarchical rulers. A prince has different duties in each country and culture. During the Chinese Empire, the position of the princes was equated with that of the court officials. In Korea during the Joseon Dynasty, only the crown prince was allowed to stay in the royal palace until adulthood, while the other princes would live outside the palace after marriage. In Europe, princes were usually appointed dukes and presided over a territory in the kingdom. In Ottoman Turkey, princes would be sent to lead a province accompanied by their mothers as training provisions to become potential heirs to the throne. The prince and his mother would only stay back in the capital when they had become sultans and queen mothers. But since the time of Sultan Ahmed I, this rule was abolished and the princes would remain in the palace until the accession to the throne.

Usually princesses are not given the power to preside as dukes as princes, except in some monarchies such as in Majapahit.

Through inter-dynastic marriage, it is hoped that there will be friendship between kingdoms and empires. The empresses of many European kings and emperors were princesses of other countries. Katherine of Aragon who was the wife of Henry VIII, King of England, was a Spanish princess. Marie Antoinette who was the wife of Louis XVI, King of France, was originally the daughter of the Holy Roman Empire. In some cases, inter-dynastic marriage will also lead to the unification of the two empires in the future. This is possible if the princess is the heir of the kingdom. This happened at the wedding of Princess Isabel, heir to the throne of Castile and Leon, to Prince Fernando, crown prince of the Kingdom of Aragon, who in his course would become the unification of Spain. In some cultures, marriages between members of the same dynasty are also performed to maintain blood purity. This happened during the time of Ancient Egypt. Pharaohs often marry their half-sisters. This was also done in Japan in the past. Emperor Bidatsu married his sister, Princess Nukatabe, who later also ascended the throne as Maharani Suiko after the death of her husband and brother. Emperor Jomei married his niece, Princess Takara. Like Suiko, Princess Takara also ascended the throne after the death of her husband under the name Maharani K\u014dgyoku. The title prince can also refer to monarchical rulers whose ranks are below those of kings and sultans, as in Praja Mangkunegara. His position in the form of a duchy was under Kasunanan and the Sultanate, so the leader of Mangkunegara was not entitled to bear the title of sultan, sunan, or king, but Prince Adipati Arya.

PT Bank Central Asia Tbk was established on August 10, 1955 under the name NV of the Semarang Knitting Factory Trading and Industrial Company. Initially, this company was not in the banking business, but a textile company in Semarang. Not long after, the textile company turned into a bank company on October 12, 1956 called NV Bank Asia. Its name was later changed to Central Bank Asia on February 13, 1957 and NV (later PT) Bank Centraal Asia on February 21, 1957. On the same day, the bank started operating, the date of which was later set as the anniversary of BCA. Bank Centraal Asia then received government permission to operate as a bank on March 14, 1957.

He improved the work system at the bank and tidied up the bank's archives, which at that time became cobwebs. Mochtar then realized that Liem as one of the strongest entrepreneurs in the New Order era was a potential for BCA's growth. Liem's business in the form of a monopoly on cloves, Bogasari flour and Indocement cement, was used by Mochtar as a \"key\" to attracting as many customers as possible. For this reason, the BCA logo used until now (since 1977) has a clove pattern. Strategies such as branch expansion and interest rate cuts were carried out.

Tin is the 49th most abundant element on earth, having 10 stable isotopes, the largest number in the periodic table. It is a silvery poor metal (post-transition metal), malleable, not easily oxidized in air making it rust-resistant, found in many aloys, and is used to coat other metals to prevent rust. Tin is obtained mainly from the mineral cassiterite formed as an oxide. Tin ore mined in Indonesia is generally of the alluvial type of tin deposits and is often referred to as secondary tin deposits or called placer tin. This type of tin ore has been detached from its parent deposit, primary tin, and by water is re-deposited elsewhere lower. Economically, the white lead-producing mineral is cassiterite with the chemical formula SnO2, although there is a small percentage of tin produced from sulfides such as stanite, cylindrite, frankeite, kanfieldite and theathylic.

The reductor used as a reducer is CO gas. The reactions that occur during the smelting process are: SnO2 + CO = SnO + CO2 SnO + CO = Sn + CO2 In the smelting process, a slag and tin melt will be formed that does not dissolve each other. The slag will bind the impurities contained in the concentrate. The most abundant impurity found in tin concentrate is the element Fe. This smelting process consists of two stages. The first stage of smelting is the smelting of tin concentrate which produces crude tin and slag. The lead content in this slag I is about 20 percent. This stage is also known as tin concentrate smelting because the smelted bait is tin ore concentrate. Slag I is then re-melted in the second stage of smelting. This fusion at stage two produces Fe-Sn compounds called hardheads and slag II with a Sn content of less than one percent. Hardheads become the raw material for stage one smelting. Crude tin from the first stage of smelting process is then taken to the next process, namely the refining process.

As a member of the Arab League, the Comoros is the only country in the Arab world that is entirely in the southern hemisphere. The country is also a member state of the African Union, the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie (International Organization of French-Speaking States), the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, and the Indian Ocean Commission. The Comoros has three official languages: Comoros, French, and Arabic. The name Comoros is taken from the Arabic vocabulary of qamar (\u0642\u0645\u0631) which means \"moon\".

Officially the country of Comoros consists of four islands in the Comoros volcanic archipelago, namely: Mayotte, the Great Comoros, Anjouan and Moheli, and also many small islands. Its capital is Moroni which is located on the island of the Great Comoros. The entire Comoros archipelago was a French colony until 1975 when a referendum for independence organized by France in 1974 was announced.

When the liquid is diluted, it melts away from its source forming a river-like flow through the valley and freezes into rocks such as lava ropi or lava blocks. If it is slightly viscous, it will flow not far from the source and form a lava dome and at the edges of it freezes to form lava blocks whose temperatures are still high. If the position is unstable, it will flow to form a hot cloud of fall from the lava. The composition of almost all lava from the Earth's crust is dominated by silicate minerals: felspar, olivine, pyroxene, amphibole, mica and quartz. By and large, the composition of lava determines its properties more than the temperature at which it erupts. The viscosity of lava is also very influential in its movement. Very viscous lava includes riolite, dacite, andesite, and tracyte. Cold basalt lava is also quite viscous. Diluted lava includes new basalt from eruptions, carbonate lava, and sometimes andesite. Viscous lava has the following properties: Viscous lava does not usually flow like a liquid and is usually either explosive ash or tepra deposits. However, viscous lava or those derived from eruptions that are hotter than usual can form lava flows. Dilute lava has the following properties: Lava can also consist of many components, sometimes including solid crystals of various minerals, pieces of xenolite, and pieces of previous frozen lava. The lava flow rate depends on the viscosity and slope. In general, lava flows slowly (0.4 km/h) with a maximum speed of about 9\u201348 km/h at steep places.

This Hawaiian term was introduced as a technical term in geology by Clarence Dutton. The sharp, angular texture makes it a powerful radar reflector and can be easily seen by satellites (bright in Magellan imagery). \u02bba\u02bb\u0101 lava usually comes out when erupting with temperatures between 1,000 and 1,100 \u00b0C.

The acronym is essentially the company's internal goal of creating a new video game experience for its players that will go beyond the experience felt when playing video games created by other companies that have also evolved over time. The first video game that Capcom created was Vulgus which was released in 1984. Since then, Capcom has published many video games that in those days were generally intended to be played in arcade machines. In 1987, Capcom released Street Fighter, the first of one of the most popular fighting video game series. 4 years later, Capcom released its sequel, Street Fighter II. Street Fighter II became a very popular video game and developed into one of the causes of the proliferation of fighting genre video games of that period, such as Mortal Kombat and Killer Instinct. In 1987 they also released the video game Mega Man which also became one of their most popular and popular video games. Since the mid-1990s, Capcom has released video games based on characters from the popular comic publisher Marvel Comics. The games they make in collaboration with Marvel are generally fighting and side-scrolling genres.

In 1994, Capcom released the video game Breath of Fire for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). The video game was their first video game in the RPG genre and received a positive response from video game lovers. In 1996, Capcom released the video game Resident Evil. This game that tells the story of a zombie attack is very popular and has a great influence in the later development of the video game world. Millions of copies of this video game sold well in the market and were cited as the cause of the best-selling PlayStation console sales at that time. Resident Evil is also considered successful in orbiting a new genre in the world of video games that never existed before, the survival horror genre. The mascots of Capcom come from popular characters from their video games. The character touted as Capcom's main mascot is Captain Commando.

In the literary sciences, paradoxes fall into the category of imcontinuity of expression that takes the form of deviations of meaning. Generally, the word paradox is often used with contradiction, but a contradiction by an incorrect definition. There are so many paradoxes that have an answer, although they are still unsolvable or can only be solved by debate. The word paradox comes from the Greek paradoxon. The term has the meaning of contrary to expectations, existing belief or perceived opinion. Paradox is to be an interesting style of language because it invites the reader to think more broadly and critically about the expressions conveyed. Paradox is used as a medium to convey rhetorical statements that imply opposition but actually contain truth. Paradoxes can grab the reader's attention because they have to examine explicit or implicit conflicting propositions. Paradoxes can encapsulate imagination, reality and polemics. Thus, if summarized as a whole, paradox has a unique characteristic because it differs from other majas in terms of presenting opposition which can give a shock effect because of the prepositions and meanings behind the conflicts described. This theory explains the passage of time to the past to meet and kill a grandfather. If the grandfather is killed in the period before the father or mother is born or before the grandfather meets the grandmother, then the father or mother is never born into the world. The impact is that it will never be born and will never time travel to the past to kill grandpa. Then, if you never carry out time travel to the past to kill the grandfather, the grandfather lives, the father or mother must be born and a child will be born.

In the predestination paradox, it can create change in the past but it cannot change something that is destined to happen in the future. Bootstrap is a paradox that results in the obscurity of an object or the effect of an object as a time travel. For example in the present there is a scientist reading the idea of the idea regarding Einstein's theory of relativity. Then try to time travel so that he can go back in time and teach the theory to Einstein long before he discovered the theory. So there is a question, who is the inventor of the theory? If that's the answer, it's certainly impossible to read the idea created by Einstein. But if Einstein was the inventor of this, it would also be impossible because he was taught back in time. Kidnapper paradox is likened to a guess that the kidnapper made to the kidnapped father. The kidnapper said to the Father whose child was abducted, \"If you can guess what was done, it will be returned.\" Dad replied, \"I guess, sudau there will be no process of returning the child.\" The kidnapper is very sorry about his guessing game, because a Father manages to guess what will be done. That is, the child must still be returned. However, if it is returned then Dad's guess is already wrong. Butterfly Effect Paradox is a paradoxical effect created from a passage of time. The consequences of time travel and actions taken in the past may cause large-scale effects in the future. For example, there is a fan of the films \"Star Wars\" and \"Indiana Jones\". Then fans traveled back in time to meet aGeorge Lucas. However, it made him stop studying at a film school until it had an impact on the future.

Humans drink by swallowing and utilizing peristalsis in the esophagus. The physiological process of drinking varies greatly among various other animals besides humans. Most animals drink water to maintain body hydration, although many can survive on water obtained from their diet. Water is needed for many physiological processes. Inadequate or excessive water intake can result in health problems. When a liquid enters the human mouth, the swallowing process is then assisted by peristalsis that deliver the fluid through the esophagus to the stomach; Most of human drinking activities are aided by gravity. Liquid can be poured from the hands or drinking utensils can be used as containers. Drinking can also be done by inhalation, usually when inhaling a hot liquid or drinking from a spoon. Human babies use a suction method in which the lips are pressed tightly around a water source, such as when breastfeeding: the combination of breath and tongue movements then creates a vacuum that draws fluid from the source. Every day, humans need 1-2 liters of water to help the physiological processes in their bodies.

When conditions prompt them to drink from water bodies, methods and movements are very different among animal species. Cats, dogs, and ruminants all lowered their necks and lay in the water with their strong tongues. Cats and dogs lick the water with a tongue shaped like a spoon. The dog licks the water by scooping it into its mouth with a spoon-shaped tongue. However, in cats, only the tip of its tongue (which is smooth) touches the water, then the cat quickly pulls its tongue back into its mouth which immediately closes; This action results in a column of liquid being attracted into the cat's mouth, which is then secured by closing its mouth.

Many desert animals never drink water, even if water is available, they rely more on water intake by eating succulent plants. In the cold and frozen environment, some animals such as rabbits, tree squirrels, and big horned sheep usually also eat snow and ice. In savannas, the way giraffes drink has become a source of speculation because it appears to defy gravity; The latest theory assumes that a giraffe's long neck functions like a pusher pump. Elephants have a unique way of drinking by sucking water into their trunks and spraying it into the mouth.

Fruit is an organ in flowering plants which is the continued development of the fruit ovary (ovary). The fruit usually wraps and protects the seeds. The various shapes and shapes of the fruit are inseparable from the main function of the fruit, namely as a target for plant seeds. Fruits in agriculture (horticulture) or food are usually referred to as fruits. Fruit in this sense is not limited to the fruit ovule, but can also come from the development of other organs. Therefore, to distinguish them, the fruit according to the botanical sense is commonly called the true fruit.. Fruit often has economic value as a food and industrial raw material because it stores a variety of plant metabolic products, ranging from carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals, alkaloids, to terpenes and terpenoids. The science that studies everything about fruit is called pomology. The gap in the notion of \"fruit\" botanically and food (fruits) can be seen from the following table: In the botanical view, fruit is as listed in the first paragraph above. In many plant species, the so-called fruit includes fruit ovules that have developed further along with the tissues that surround it. For flowering plants, fruit is a tool for spreading its seeds; The presence of seeds inside may indicate that the organ is a fruit, although there are also seeds that do not come from the fruit. Within these limits, the variety of fruits can be very large, including mangoes, apples, tomatoes, chilies, and others. But also grains (kariopsis) of rice, seeds (grains) of corn, or peanut pods.

Fruits are any part of a plant on the surface of the soil that grows enlarged and (usually) fleshy or contains a lot of water. True fruits in the botanical sense can be classified as vegetables in the horticultural sense, such as tomatoes, chili fruits, string bean pods, and cucumber fruits. However, it can also be found that untrue fruits (pseudo-fruits) are classified as fruits, such as monkey guava fruit (which is actually the enlargement of the flower base; the true fruit is the tip shaped like a bent monkey), jackfruit fruit (i.e. enlargement of the flower cob; the true fruit is the white (Jw. concrete), gummy part of the 'flesh' that people eat is the flower tent),  or pineapple fruit. Fruit is the perfect growth of the ovary (ovary). Each fruit will contain one or more ovulums, each of which contains an egg. The seeds are fertilized through a process initiated by pollination, namely the transfer of pollen from the anthers to the pistil head. After the pollen is attached to the pistil head, the pollen germinates and its contents grow into a pollen reed containing sperm. This reed continues to grow through the pistil stalk to the ovule, where there is a union between the sperm derived from pollen and the egg that dwells in the ovule, forming a diploid zygote. Fertilization in flowering plants involves both plasmogamy, namely the protoplasmic union of the egg and sperm, and karyogamy, which is the union of the cell nuclei of the two. After that, the formed zygote begins to grow into an embryo (institution), the ovule grows into a seed, and the walls of the fruit ovary, called the pericarp, grow fleshy (on stone fruit or drupa) or form a dry, hard protective layer (on the fruit of the geluk or nux).

The term was coined, succinctly and a bit of a joke, by reporter Melody Maker. Although it had been rejected by the musicians themselves and soon taken down, German media then began to use it as a term for all skirt bands in Germany, from the late 1960s and 1970s, while abroad the term was resurrected specifically to refer to experimental artists who often used synthesizers and other electronic instruments. The term is the result of how people who spoke English, accepted the music at that time, and did not refer to a specific musical scene, or a specific movement, like many krautrock musicians who were not familiar with each other. Many consider that a DJ from the BBC, John Peel, was a man who was instrumental in spreading krautrock's reputation to non-German-speaking people.citation needed] Despite the influence of traditional blues music and British and American rock and roll music at the time, this act contributed to the evolution of electronic music and ambient music, as was the birth of post-punk,  alternative rock and new-age music.

The Subaru brand was first used in 1955 after FHI entered the automotive industry with the production of its first car in the form of a Subaru 1500 sedan. Fuji Heavy Industries is now working with Toyota Motor Corporation, which owns 16.5% of FHI's shares. Subaru is the Japanese name for a star cluster in the Pleiades in the constellation Taurus. The six stars that can be seen with the naked eye in the Pleiades are made into the Subaru logo which symbolizes the six companies that merged to form Fuji Heavy Industries. The six-star logo now used as Fuji Heavy Industries' corporate identity was first used on the 1958 Subaru 360 car. The creator of the Subaru logo is industrial designer Tatsuz\u014d Sasaki who is also responsible for the basic design of the Subaru 360. The logo after that was repaired several times. Although the position of the stars on the logo no longer follows the actual arrangement of stars in the Pleiades, the Subaru logo still uses 6 stars (1 large and 5 small). Subaru cars with engines of 1500 cc or more use boxer engines that have a lower center of gravity. Subaru is the only car brand that uses the symmetrical All-Wheel Drive system for all its product range. which provides better traction so that it is safer to drive in all road conditions, wet, slippery, muddy, and sharp turns.

But in 1918, they managed to build the first aircraft, a Nakajima Type 1 with an engine made in the United States that crashed after takeoff. The number two Type 1 aircraft also crashed. The third plane managed to take off safely, but crashed at the time of landing. At that time, the company was used as a mockery by the locals, \"There are too many banknotes, the price of rice is rising, everything is rising, the only ones who can't fly] are just Nakajima's plane.\" The Nakajima Type 4 was finally completed in 1919, and successfully flew over Ojima City, Gunma Prefecture. In 1919, the government held a postal aircraft flying speed race between Tokyo and Osaka. The Nakajima Type 4 completed the race in 3 hours and 18 minutes, and managed to beat foreign-made aircraft. The race was awarded 9,500 yen, and was an opportunity for Nakajima to publicly demonstrate their technological superiority. The Japanese military saw drastic advances in aircraft technology during World War I in Europe. A team of experts was brought to Japan from France, and the Japanese began to seriously study the possibility of licensing production of airframes and aircraft engines. Nakajima sent Kimikei Nakajima to France to study aircraft technology. In 1922, the Nakajima Type B-6 was completed, and was an all-metal aircraft. The model was imitated from the French-made Breguet 14 double-wing bomber.

This head covering consists of eight panels sewn together, with a piece of rope strands on top.

Its appearance is very similar to the Jewish head covering, kippah, although its importance is very different. All members of the Roman Catholic Church who have been ordained are entitled to wear zucchetto.

Priests and deacons wore black zucchetto although its use among priests was very rare (except among the priests of the abbey), and even rarer among deacons. A brown piece of Zucchetto-like cloth and a similar black head covering were sometimes worn by Franciscan and Benedictine friars, but these were usually more of an important head covering to warm the head than just a ceremonial fixture.

Around 1600 BC letters in the Phoenician alphabet had linear shapes that became the basis for subsequent forms. His name seems to be very closely related to the alef in the Hebrew alphabet. When the ancient Greeks adopted the alphabet, they did not use the sound gap consonants (hamzah sounds) that this letter contained in Phoenician and other Semitic languages, therefore they used this sign for the vowel /a/, and retained its name with minor changes (alpha). In the earliest Greek inscriptions after the Greek Dark Age, which occurred in the 8th century BC, this letter was written lying down, but in the later Greek alphabet, this letter is generally similar to the modern uppercase A, although various local variations can be distinguished by shortening one of its legs, or by the angle at which the transverse line is placed. The Etruscans brought the Greek alphabet into their civilization in the Italian Peninsula and left this letter unchanged. Then the Romans adopted the Etruscan alphabet to write Latin, and the resulting letters were later preserved in the modern Latin alphabet used to write many languages, including English.

The company's name was conceived as a portmanteau of the words integrated and electronics, with co-founder Noyce having been the key inventor of the integrated circuit (microchip). The fact that \"intel\" is a term for intelligence information also makes the name appropriate. Intel was an early developer of SRAM and DRAM memory chips, representing most of its business until 1981. Although Intel created the world's first commercial microprocessor chip in 1971, it was not until the success of the personal computer (PC) that became its main business. the purpose of Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore founding Intel was to reap profits because at the time microprocessors were very expensive Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce originally proposed a combination of their names to be made into company names: Moore Noyce.

With molar masses of 22.99 and 35.45 g/mol, respectively, 100 g of NaCl contains 39.34 g of Na and 60.66 g of Cl. These compounds are the salts that most affect ocean salinity and extracellular fluids in many multicellular organisms. As the main component in table salt, sodium chloride is often used as a seasoning and food preservative. A large amount of sodium chloride is used in many industrial processes, and is the main source of sodium and chlorine compounds used as raw materials for further chemical synthesis. The second main application of sodium chloride is to remove the road layer in sub-freezing weather. In addition to the familiar use of sodium chloride salts in households, the more dominant application of about 250 megatons of sodium chloride production per year (2008 data) is included in the production of chemicals and as defrosting. Sodium chloride salts are used, directly or indirectly, in the production of many chemicals, which consume most of the world's sodium chloride production. This compound is a starting material for the chloralkali process, which produces chlorine and sodium hydroxide according to the chemical equation This electrolysis is carried out either in mercury cells, diaphragm cells, or membrane cells. Each uses a different method to separate chlorine from sodium hydroxide. Other technologies are being developed due to the high energy consumption of electrolysis, where small improvements in efficiency can have a large economic return.

These methods listed provide a procedure for analyzing sodium chloride to determine whether it is suitable for its intended use and application. Hard water contains calcium and magnesium ions that interfere with the action of soap and contribute to the buildup of scale or layers of alkaline mineral deposits in household and industrial appliances and pipes. Commercial and residential water softener units use ion exchange resins to remove the ions that cause such hardness. This resin is produced and regenerated using sodium chloride.

It can also be interpreted as reason which is the capacity to consciously apply logic by drawing a conclusion in the methodology of new or pre-existing information using various diverse patterns aimed at seeking truth. Reasoning is also a thought process that departs from positive empirical science (or with empirical observation) by generating a number of concepts and elaborations. Thus, based on that observation, the same propositions or a number of propositions that are encountered and considered correct will be formed, so people conclude a new proposition that was not known before. This process of observation is called reasoning. Reasoning is carried out using a syllogism device. In reasoning, the proposition on which the inference is based is called the premise and the conclusion is called a conclusion. The relationship between premise and conclusion is called consequence.. According to the Ministry of National Education, reasoning is a way of using reason; logical thinking or way of thinking, mental processes in developing the mind from some fact or principle. Meanwhile, Scientific argues that reasoning is a specific way of thinking to draw conclusions from some existing premises. So not all thinking is reasoning. Thinking activities that are not reasoning such as remembering things and daydreaming. From some of these statements, it can be interpreted that reasoning is a thought process using logical foundations to draw conclusions based on facts (premises) that have been considered correct. The basic concept of reasoning is a statement. This statement is then used in processing and comparison. Etymologically, reasoning based on KKBI comes from the basic word \"reason\" meaning considerations about good and bad and so on and or reason in every decision must be based on healthy things.

Given that the essence of man is a being who thinks, feels, behaves, and acts, reasoning is also an abstract activity of the mind with the embodiment symptom of symbols (symbols). The symbol proposition used in reasoning is in the form of a statement sentence with the embodiment of reasoning in the form of an argument which can determine the correctness of the conclusion of the premise. Based on the above explanation, it is clear that the three forms of human thought are interrelated thinking activities so reasoning requires propositions and propositions to presuppose an understanding which is if \"there is no proposition without understanding and no reasoning without proposition\". Together with the formation of the definition of expansion will also be formed proposition and from the proposition will be used as a premise for reasoning. Or it can also be said that to reason requires a proposition while a proposition is the result of a series of understandings. The definition of the concept of reasoning according to experts, namely the Collins Dictionary, means that reasoning, known as reasoning, is the process by which we reach a conclusion after thinking about all the facts. Galloti (1989) interprets that reasoning is a series of transformations of information given to examine conclusions. It can be said that Reasoning is the thinking power of a person in attracting and inferring something. The basic principle of reasoning in Aristotle's opinion is categorized into 3 parts, namely the principle of identity that says something is the same as its own, the principle of contradiction reads something cannot be at once and that and not that at the same time or something a statement cannot have true and untrue values at the same time. In the sense of other words that something is not possible simultaneously such as \"w\" and \"non w\", the principle of exclusion reads the principle of middle ground allowance or the principle of absence of a third possibility.

In biphobia, there is a rejection of bisexuality and a negative view of people who have a bisexual orientation. Everyone can experience biphobia and is a source of social discrimination against bisexual people. Biphobia is a portmanteau term following the term homophobia. It comes from the prefix bi- (meaning \"two\") in bisexual and -phobia (from the Greek word: \u03c6\u03cc\u03b2\u03bf\u03c2, ph\u00f3bos meaning \"fear\") in homophobia. Biphobia, homophobia, and transphobia are the main terms that describe the intolerance and discrimination that LGBT people face. Biphobic is an adjective that describes something related to biphobia, while in English it is also known as the word biphobe which means a person who is suspected of storing biphobia. Biphobia does not mean phobia in the sense of clinical psychology, but like the meaning of phobia in xenophobic terms. Biphobia can result in people perceiving that bisexuality is \"not real\", emphasizing that people who claim to be bisexual are not purely bisexual, or that the phenomenon of bisexuality is rarer than existing claims. One form of this denial is based on the heterosexist view that heterosexuality is the only natural sexual orientation. Deviance is considered a psychological pathology or an antisocial behavior. Thus, homophobia and biphobia are not much different in substance. Another form of denial is based on a binary view of sexuality : that all people are considered monosexual, or in other words just gay/lesbian or heterosexual. In the 1980s, modern studies of sexuality dominated the idea that legitimate sexual orientations were simply heterosexuality and homosexuality, while bisexuality was considered a \"second homosexuality\". Bisexuals are perceived as homosexual people who are not overt about their identity or someone (whether gay/lesbian or heterosexual) who wants to experiment sexually outside of their \"usual\" sexuality.

Others accept the theoretical existence of bisexuality but with limited understanding as equal attraction to men and women. Bisexuals who do not share an interest in both genders are considered homosexuals or heterosexuals, depending on which level of preference is higher. Others simply admit that it is women who can be bisexual, and deny the existence of bisexual men. Some denial asserts that bisexual behavior or identity is merely a social trend \u2013 as exemplified by \"bisexual chic\" or gender bending \u2013 and not an intrinsic personality trait. Same-gender sexual activity is dismissed as merely a substitute for sex with members of the opposite sex, or as a more accessible source of sexual gratification. Situational homosexuality in sex-segregated environments is presented as an example of this behavior. Biphobia is common from the heterosexual community, but is frequently exhibited by gay and lesbian people as well, usually with the notion that bisexuals are able to escape oppression from heterosexuals by conforming to social expectations of opposite-gender sex and romance. This leaves some that identify as bisexual to be perceived as \"not enough of either\" or \"not real.\" An Australian study conducted by Roffee and Waling in 2016 established that bisexual people faced microaggressions, bullying, and other anti-social behaviors from people within the lesbian and gay community. Bisexual erasure (also referred to as bisexual invisibility) is a phenomenon that tends to omit, falsify, or re-explain evidence of bisexuality in history, academia, the news media, and other primary sources, sometimes to the point of denying that bisexuality exists.

This is reflected in the doctrine of his army such as \"Whoever controls the heights then rules the world\". This shows that mastery over heights must be achieved by technology. But the word war no longer acts as a verb, but has already shifted to adjectives. Those who popularized this were journalists, so gradually this shift gained its position, but in general war meant \"opposition\".

Commonly used in everyday life such as \"worn car tires\" which means that the tires of the car become shrinking because they are scratched by the road. 1. Overload Every car produced by the manufacturer is always designed to have the ability to carry the maximum load up to a certain weight. Generally, manufacturers have listed the empty weight and the weight of the contents of the car in question that was purchased. Empty weight, meaning the weight of the car when it does not carry goods or passengers and is not driven. While the weight of the contents is the weight of the car after transporting passengers and compartment goods The weight and carrying capacity or weight of the contents are informed by the manufacturer through a manual or brochure about the specifications of the car. The weight has taken into account all aspects, including the basic material of the body frame, suspension, and of course tires. Thus, if the load carried by the car exceeds the recommended standards, the pressure on the tires will also be higher and heavier. On the other hand, with heavy pressure and continuous friction with the road surface along the way it becomes a tread and the tire tread quickly thins. Even the possibility of tires popping is also very large. Therefore it is highly recommended, do not transport loads that exceed the limit. 2.

This means that the tires are not balanced, when the car is run the direction of movement of the tires is not aligned. There is a deviating slope of 3\u20135 degrees. In fact, the direction of each tire is different. Some are left or right. If the car is driven, the tires feel like they are forced to run or drag.

Problematic suspension system device Another contributing factor to tire damage is the problematic suspension component. The reason is, if the component has a problem, it causes unstable car control. If the car is unstable, then the direction of moving the tires when the car is driving is also unstable. Move the tires sometimes left or right, even when crossing bumpy roads or with tire holes such as being blown away and dragged. Thus, the surface of the tire is quickly thin, the structure of the tire frame in the form of wire and thread also wears out quickly. 4. The size of the rim and tires that do not match The facts that exist prove, tires that do not match the size of the rim (the size of the rim is larger or smaller) and are forced will make the load supported by the tire wall too heavy. As a result, the tire seems to be pulled so that it is easy to crack, break, or bump. Therefore use rims of the size corresponding to the tires. 5. Insufficient or excessive tire pressure Tire manufacturers design their production tires by having the ability to support car loads both heavy and fill (maximum) with a certain agin pressure. It is intended to provide comfort and safety for car users, as well as so that the tire life lasts according to the standards set. Therefore, if the tire pressure is less than the set standard, the pressure on the tire is also heavier. As a result, the friction between the tire surface and the road surface is also getting harder. As a result, the surface of the tire is quickly thin, the structure of the tire frame made of wire and thread is also quickly damaged.

After World War II Japan became poor, so cigarettes were valuable, and the invention became a success. After seeing an electrical calculator at the first Business Show in Ginza, Tokyo in 1949, Kashio and his younger siblings used their profits from yubiwa pipes to create their own calculators.

Salatiga during the colonial period is recorded as the place where the treaty was signed between Prince Sambernyawa or Raden Mas Said (later to become K.G.P.A.A. Mangkunegara I) on the one hand and Kasunanan Surakarta and VOC on the other. This agreement became the legal basis for the establishment of the Duchy of Mangkunegaran. During the Dutch colonial era, the boundaries and status of Salatiga City were quite clear, based on the Staatsblad 1917 No. 266 from July 1, 1917, Stadsgemeente Salatiga was established whose area consisted of 8 villages. Due to the support of geographical factors, cool air and a very strategic location, as well as luxurious Indist architecture buildings, Salatiga City was quite known for its beauty during the Dutch colonial period, even gaining the nickname De Schoonste Stad van Midden-Java (the Most Beautiful City in Central Java). The Salatiga area occupies a very strategic position because it is located at the crossroads of five majors, namely Semarang, Bringin, Surakarta, Magelang, and Ambarawa.

And was one of the divisional kingdoms that Airlangga also founded. This kingdom led by the Isyana dynasty and centered on Dahanapura, was the name of an ancient city in the past that is now part of Kediri City. Indeed, the city of Daha existed before the event of the division of the kingdom by Airlangga. Daha stands for Dahanapura, which means city of fire. This name is found in the Pamwatan inscription issued by Airlangga in 1042.

Lines, and Mitsui Fudosan. It was founded by Mitsui Takatoshi (1622\u20131694) in Matsusaka, which now belongs to Mie Prefecture. From his shop, called Echigoya (\u8d8a\u5f8c\u5c4b), Mitsui Takatoshi's father originally sold miso and ran a pawnhouse business. Later, the family opened a second store in Edo (now called Tokyo). Takatoshi moved to Edo when he was 14 years old, and then his brother came with him. Takatoshi was later repatriated to Matsutaka by his brother, After the death of his brother 24 years later, he took over the family store. Takatoshi then opened a new branch in 1673; namely a large gofukuya (kimono shop) in Nihonbashi, a district in downtown Edo. The beginning of Mitsui's business history dates back to the Enp\u014d era, which was a neng\u014d meaning \"Prolonged Prosperity\". Later, the gofukuya division was separated from Mitsui, and is now called Mitsukoshi. Usually, gofukuya provides products according to order, by going to the buyer's home (usually a person with a high position or a person who is successful in business), then an order is made, and then a new order is produced. Mitsui didn't use this way, they produced the goods first, and then displayed them in the store. To buy the product, each person must come directly to the store, and pay with cash. At the time, this kind of business model was still unknown in Japan.

At about the same time, the Edo government struck a deal with Osaka. Osaka will sell plants and other materials to pay her land tax. Money is sent to Edo\u2014but sending money during feudal Japan is very dangerous. In 1683, the shogunate allowed the establishment of a money exchange (ry\u014dgaeten) in Edo. Mitsui's \"money changer\" also facilitates remittances and mitigates the risks of these remittances. After the Meiji Restoration, Mitsui was one of the companies that could develop into zaibatsu, as they had grown and wealthy at the beginning of the development of this modern industry. Companies such as Mitsui and Sumitomo are also led by people from outside the owner's family, such as Minomura Rizaemon, who can ultimately foresee the future political and economic situation, by making friends with government officials, politicians, and large investors. Mitsui's main business was originally textiles, finance, and commerce. Textiles and finance are businesses that have been passed down since the Tokugawa Era. Mitsui then expanded into the mining business, because the original owner of the mine defaulted on the loan that had been given by Mitsui, and also because it could buy the mine cheaply from the government. Mitsui also managed to become the largest business in Japan before the outbreak of world war. Diversification is also carried out into businesses related to the business that Mitsui has been in, in order to create vertical or horizontal integration. On July 1, 1876, Mitsui Bank, Japan's first private bank, was founded with Takashi Masuda (1848\u20131938) as its president.

Narrowly speaking, Urartu is the Assyrian term for geographical area, while \"kingdom of Urartu\" or \"lands of Biainili\" is the term used by modern historiography for the Hurro-Urartian-language Proto-Armenian lands of the Iron Age that emerged in the region. The name Urartu comes from Assyrian sources that use the Akkadian language: the Assyrian king Salmaneser I (1263\u20131234 BC) recorded an attack on this region by conquering the entire territory of \"Uruatri.\" Salmaneser's text uses the name \"Urartu\" for a geographical area, not a kingdom, and mentions the names of the eight \"lands\" that were within the Urartu area (which had not been unified at the time of the military attack). \"Urartu\" is a cognate with the biblical terms \"Ararat,\" Akkadian \"Urashtu,\" and Armenian \"Ayrarat.\" The name used by the locals as a toponym was Biainili (or Biaineli), which formed the Armenian root word \u054e\u0561\u0576 (\"Van\"), thus appearing the name \"Kingdom of Van (Bianili)\" or \"Vannic Kingdom.\" Urartu was spoken by the royal elite, but the population was likely multiethnic, and by the end of urartu was mostly (pre-Proto-)Armenian. According to this theory, the Armenian-speaking population is descended from proto-Armenians who migrated to the Armenian highlands around the 7th century BC, mixed with the Hurrian-speaking locals (this is called the \"Phrygian theory\"), first proposed by Herodotus).

They usually live in dense colonies of many identical individual polyps. Corals include coral reef builders who inhabit tropical oceans and emit calcium carbonate to form a hard skeleton. A coral \"group\" is a colony of many genetically identical polyps. Each polyp is a sac-like animal that is usually only a few millimeters in diameter and a few centimeters long. A pair of tentacles surrounds the mouth opening in the middle. The exoskeleton is excreted near the base of the polyp. For several generations, the colony created a huge skeleton that characterizes each coral species. The head of the individual grows with asexual reproduction of polyps. Corals also breed sexually by spawning: polyps of the same species release gametes simultaneously over a period of one to several nights around the time of the full moon. Although some corals are capable of catching small fish and plankton using stinging cells on their tentacles, most corals get most of their energy and nutrients from unicellular photosynthetic dinoflagellates of the genus Symbiodinium that live within their tissues. These dinoflagellates are commonly known as zooxanthellae. Such corals require sunlight and grow in clear, shallow water, usually at depths of less than 60 metres (200 ft). Corals are a major contributor to the physical structure of coral reefs that thrive in tropical and subtropical waters, such as the Great Barrier Reef off the coast of Queensland, Australia. Other corals do not rely on zooxanthellae and can live in much deeper water, with the cold-water genus Lophelia living at depths of 3,300 metres (10,800 ft).

In Afrikaans it is called Rooikat, the \"red cat\" although it has traditionally had alternative names such as Persian Lynx, and Egyptian Lynx (but not considered an actual lynx). Instead, this animal is now believed to be closely related to the golden and serval cats. This karakal is classified as a small cat, but the heaviest of all small cats, as well as the fastest, becomes almost as fast as Serval. Caracal slender but muscular, cat, with long legs and a short tail. Males typically weigh 13 to 18 kilograms (29 to 40 lb), while females weigh about 11 kilograms (24 pounds). Caracal resembles the Eurasian Lynx, and for a long time it was considered a close relative of lynxes. It has a tail almost one-third the length of its body, and both sexes look the same. Caracal is 65 to 90 centimeters long (26 to 35 in), with 30 cm (12 in) tail length. Compared with lynxes, it has longer legs, shorter fur and a slimmer appearance. The color of its fur varies between burgundy, gray, or sand-colored. Melanistic (black) also occurs in caracals. Young caracals have a reddish spot on the underside. Adult caracals have no markings except for black spots above the eyes and small white patches around the eyes and nose.

The most striking feature of the caracal is, tufted black ears, which also explains the origin of its name, karakulak, Turkish for \"black ear\". Young caracals have a black color on the outside of the ears, which disappears as they become adults. The ears, which are used to search for prey, are controlled by 29 different muscles. The legs of the caracal have stiff hairs that grow a lot between the paw pads. This makes it possible for him to walk on soft sand. Jaws are short and equipped with powerful teeth. About 92 percent of caracals do not have a second upper premolar. Caracal is spread in Africa, the Middle East, Pakistan and India. Its main habitat is dry steppes and semi-deserts, but also inhabits forests, savannas and forest thickets. They generally choose open areas, so that as long as there is enough cover, in the form of bushes and rocks, it becomes a place to ambush prey. Life expectancy in the wild is 12 years, and 17 years in captivity. Caracal can survive without drinking for a long time - the need for water is met with the body fluids of its prey. As it is also surprising that it turned out to be easy to tame, it has been used as a hunting cat in Iran and India. Adult karakals live either alone or rarely in pairs. Females inhabit a relatively small range of territory, ranging from 5 to 57 square kilometers (1.9-22 sq mi), depending on the availability of local prey .

In its use in the mass media, the mention of this title can reflect a tribute to a learned man in the field of religion (usage in the Islamic world); or tends to impress as a bigoted (usage in some Western mass media). Ideally, an educated Mullah should study Islamic traditions (hadith) and Islamic law (fiqh). The image that is often shown is as a memorizer of the Qur'an. Less educated villagers may often be classified as educated Muslims, but they are not fully regarded as \"Mullahs\" or religious leaders.

The ushul case is the things of worship whose arguments are agreed upon by the scholars of the 4 schools for example the pillars of Islam which are 5 ,the pillars of faith which are 6.while on the matter of furu (branch) then can add or subtract as long as it does not contradict the Quran and sunnah, and the difference in furu we can see in the 4 schools in carrying out their fiqh. An example of heresy practice is for example increasing the number of rakaat of dawn prayers which was originally set at 2 raka'at, then adding another 1 raka'at so that it becomes 3 raka. Another example that is interpreted as heresy is like a person who is breaking the fast and then increasing the time of contentment when in fact, the time of breaking the maghrib call to prayer, plus the iftar himself must wait for the call to prayer'. In fiqh, heresy can be categorized into 5 (five), namely: compulsory, haram, sunnah, makruh, and mubah. This categorization is based on the information of Sheikh Izzuddin Abdul Aziz bin Abdussalam As-Salami, in the book of Al-Qawa\u00eddu Al-Kubra, Al-Mausum bi Qawaidil Ahkam fi Ishlahil Anam, Darul Qalam, Damascus, Print I, Year 2000, Juz II, Page 337, as follows: \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0628\u0650\u062f\u0652\u0639\u064e\u0629\u064f \u0641\u0650\u0639\u0652\u0644\u064f \u0645\u064e\u0627 \u0644\u064e\u0645\u064f \u0644\u064e\u0645\u064f \u0645\u064e\u0645\u064f \ufffd \u064a\u064f\u0639\u0652\u0647\u064e\u062f\u0652 \u0641\u0650\u064a \u0639\u064e\u0635\u0652\u0631\u0650 \u0631\u064e\u0633\u064f\u0648\u0644\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0647\u0650 - \u0635\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0647\u064f \u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0647\u0650 \u0648\u064e\u0633\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0645\u064e -.

A bad and heretical heresy is to increase or subtract the share of the ushul of religion (ushul is a command and prohibition that scholars have agreed upon because the qur'an and hadith arguments are clear and there is no ikhtilaf in understanding) ushul i.e. the 5th pillar of Islam and the 6th pillar of faith.

This letter usually symbolizes the hissing consonant of the voiceless sound gap. The Semitic letter \u05d7 (\u1e25\u00ea\u1e6f) most likely symbolizes the voiceless upstream-esophageal hissing Consonant (/\u0127/). The shape of this letter probably means fence. The early Greek alphabet H read /h/, but over time it became the vowel letter eta (\u0397, \u03b7) which reads /\u025b\u02d0/ (in modern Greek, this phoneme joins /i/.) Etruscan and Latin once had the phoneme /h/, but almost all Romance language families lost that sound. Later Romanian borrowed the phoneme /h/ from nearby Slavic languages, and Spanish developed a secondary /h/ sound from /f/ before losing that sound again, while some dialects of Spanish used /h/ as the /s/ allophone in some regions that used the language.

\u02c8\u0283o\u028af\u0259r] (USA) or \u02c8\u0283\u0259\u028af\u0259(r)] (UK); Hebrew: \u05e9\u05d5\u05e4\u05e8; also spelled Syofar) is a serunai or wind instrument made of horns used as a musical instrument for Jewish religious ritual purposes. It is closely related to two important Jewish holidays, namely Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. This shofar originated in Israel for Jewish vocations. Shofar can be found in a variety of sizes. Shofar is often mentioned in the Hebrew Bible, from Exodus to the Book of Zechariah, and throughout the Talmud and later rabbinic literature. Shofar's voice is said to be \"very noisy,\" heard from within the thick clouds on the top of Mount Sinai that made all the children of Israel tremble in awe (Exodus 19, 20). Shofar is blown at the time of the New Moon and formal feasts (Numbers 10:10; Psalm 81:4), and also for the declaration of the year of deliverance, Jubilee (Jubilee) (Leviticus 25:9). The first day of the 7th month (Tishri) is termed \"a warning of the blowing\" (Leviticus 23:24), or \"a day of blowing\" Shofar (Numbers 29:1); Modern use of this equipment is primarily in relation to those days. In the past, Shofar was also involved in other religious customs, such as parades (2 Samuel 5:15; 1Chr. 15:28), or in orchestras as a devotee to hymns (Psalm 98:6; compare Psalm 47:5). More often it is used as a signal of war, such as the silver trumpet mentioned in Numbers 10:9 (see Joshua 6:4; Judges 3:27; 7:16, 20; 1 Samuel 8:3). The Torah describes the first day of the seventh month (the 1st of the month of Tisyri = Rosh Hashanah) as zikron teruah (warning of blowing; Leviticus 24) and as yom teru'ah (day of blowing; Number 29). This has been interpreted by Jewish scholars as referring to the voice of Shofar. The shofar in the Temple of Jerusalem is generally affiliated with the trumpet; And the two tools have been used together at various times. ", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "On New Year's Day (Rosh Hashanah) the principle of customs has been carried out with Shofar, in which the instrument is placed in the center with a trumpet on both sides; This shofar is made of wild goat horns and is straight in shape, equipped with gold on the pincer. In the days the principle customs had been carried out with a trumpet in the middle and with Shofar on both sides. At that time the shofarot was a horn \"which is curved in shape and equipped with silver on the pincer\". In Yom Kippur from the jubilee year this custom has been done with Shofar like on New Year's Day. This shofar had been blown in Joshua's time to help him capture the city of Jericho. When they finished circling the fortified city, shofar was blown so that the wall fell and the Israelites could enter and capture the city. This shofar has generally been taken out to the battlefield for troops to know when a war is about to begin. The one who blows Shofar will call out the troops from the top of the hill. The whole army could hear Shofar's call from their positions because of its distinctive sound. In modern times, this Shofar has been enhanced in its religious use because of the expectation of playing musical instruments as a sign of mourning for the destruction of the Temple. (It is noted that the full orchestra played in the Temple may have included primitive organs.) This shofar continues to be used to announce the New Year and new moon, to begin the Sabbath, and to mark togetherness on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. Secular use has been removed (although this Shofar was sounded to commemorate the reunification of Jerusalem in 1967) Shofar is primarily related to Rosh Hashanah. Indeed, Rosh Hashanah is called \"Yom T'ruah\" (the day of shofar's blowing).

Words can be used to accompany basic nouns, nouns formed from verbs, pronouns, or passive verbs. The word clothing does not change the main meaning of the noun, but is generally used to change the \"identity\" or \"usage\" of the word in a sentence. In Indonesian, the article has 3 uses. A third use can also occur as part of a single verb, e.g. ber ber which means \"to be tense\". In some other languages, especially the languages of the Indo-European language group (such as English, French, and Dutch) and Semitic languages (such as Arabic and Hebrew), articles are very commonly used. In these languages, articles are used to denote the definiteness (English: definiteness) of a noun. The two most common types of articles are takrif articles (definite articles) and taktakrif articles (indefinite articles). Definitional articles (also called articles of course and definite articles) are used in circumstances where the noun in question is already known to the listener from the context. The nominee is already known for example because it has been mentioned before, or because it is specifically explained. Examples of specific articles are the in English, le, la, l and les in French, as well as al- in Arabic. Taktakrif articles (also called taktentu articles and takpasti articles) are used when the nomina in question is not something that the listener already knows. An example of this is when the noun is only mentioned for the first time, or just an object in a hypothesis, or when the speaker only talks about the general thing about the object. Examples are a and an in English, as well as un, une and des in French.

In other words, the crisscrossing between the warp thread and the feed alternately. Woven fabrics are usually made of wood grain, cotton, silk, and others. Woven fabrics are usually made of wood fiber, cotton, silk, silver thread, gold thread and others. Anthropologists state that weaving activities have existed since 500 BC, especially in the regions of Mesopotamia, Egypt, India, and Turkey.citation needed] The existence of traditional Indonesian woven fabrics is estimated to have developed since the Neolithic (Prehistoric) period. This is evidenced by the discovery of prehistoric prehistoric objects, such as weaving, tools for spinning, and materials that are clearly visible in the fabric made of cotton. Found more than 3,000 years ago at the sites of East Sumba, Mount Wingko, Yogyakarta, Gilimanuk, Melolo.citation needed] The manufacture of woven fabrics is common in Indonesia, especially in Java, Sumatra, and Kalimantan. Usually the production of woven fabrics is made on a household scale. Some areas that are famous for their woven fabric production are West Sumatra, Palembang, and West Java. In Palembang there are two weaving crafts, namely Tajung and Songket fabrics, usually Palembang songket is woven using silver and gold threads, while Tajung or Sewet Tajung Gebeng fabrics are woven with silk yarn, besides Palembang, songket weaving producers can be found in West Sumatra, Sambas, Bali etc., need reference] The art of weaving is closely related to the system of knowledge, culture, beliefs, natural environment,  and a system of social organization in society. Because the social culture in society is diverse, the art of weaving in each region has differences. Therefore, the art of weaving in society has always been particular or has distinctive characteristics, and is part of the cultural representation of that community.

The term has been plurally used as a designation for the event of the appearance of gods in Greek and Near Eastern religions in the Ancient Ages. Wiracarita Ilias is the oldest source containing descriptions of theophany in the Classical Century, but it is possible that the oldest theophany descriptions are expressed in gilgamesh's manuscripts. The term theophany was later used by Christians and Jews as a special term for God's manifestation of Abraham's worship to man, i.e. the sensory signs that hint at His presence. There are not many descriptions of theophany that can be found in the Hebrew Bible. In Delfi, Theophania (\u0398\u03b5\u03bf\u03c6\u03ac\u03bd\u03b9\u03b1) is the name of an annual festival held in the spring to celebrate the return of Lord Apolo from his winter rest in Hyperborea. The culminating event in this event was the removal of the image of the gods from their respective homes to be displayed to the public. Later in the day, Roman mystery religions often held similar ceremonies, namely showing at a glance the images of worship to excite the audience. The appearance of Lord Zeus to Semele turned out to be beyond the limits of the acceptability of mortals, as a result of which Semele was struck to death by Zeus. Despite this, most theophanies in Greek mythology are not so lethal. Theophany that is not commonplace in Greek mythology is found in the story of Prometeus. This character is not a god who resides at the top of Olimpus but a titan who leaks knowledge about fire to humans. There is no description of the fate of the human being caught up with this theophany, but Prometeus was rewarded with severe punishment by Zeus. Sightings of divine figures or heroic figures occasionally appear in history, whether dream-like or consciously witnessed apparitions, and often boil down to the formation of a cult, or at least give birth to an act of worship and devotion to the memory of the event.

Vishnu's most popular awatara is Sri Kresna, while the most famous theophany in Hinduism is contained in Bagawatgita, part of the Mahabarata temple. Shahdan in the field of Kurusetra, after a long visit by Sri Kresna, Arjuna begged Sri Kresna to appear in the form of his equality. His plea was granted. Sri Kresna looked at Arjuna's spiritual eyes in order to be able to witness Wiswarupa, his form of spirituality, which is the noblest manifestation of Lord Vishnu which encompasses the sarwa of nature. This description of theophany is the essence of chapter XI of Bagawatgita. The Hebrew Bible affirms that God revealed Himself to mankind. God spoke to Adam and Eve in Eden (Genesis 3:9\u201319), to Cain (Genesis 4:9\u201315), to Noah (Genesis 6:13, Genesis 7:1, Genesis 8:15) and to his sons (Gen. 9:1-8), and to Abraham and Sarah (Genesis 18). God also twice appeared to Hagar, the slave woman who gave birth to Ishmael, Abraham's first child (Genesis 16). The first revelation Moses received from Jehovah in the blazing thicket was \"a mighty apparition\", to the point that \"Moses was afraid to look\" Yahweh (Exodus 3:3, 6). The first revelation Samuel received in a dream was also called a \"vision,\" after which God often \"appeared\" in Shiloh (I Samuel 3:15, 21). The first revelations Isaiah received were also the appearance of God (Isaiah 6:1-5), as were Amos (Amos 7:1, 4, 8:1, 9:1), Jeremiah (Jeremiah 1:11, 13), Ezekiel (Ezekiel 1:1 etc., 8:1-3), and Zechariah (Zahkaria 1, 6), even all the figures who called themselves \"seers\". Balaam also claimed to have witnessed the \"vision of the Almighty\" (Numbers 24:4).

The Egyptian historian Manetho named it \"Mieb\u00eed\u00f3s\" and declared his reign to last for 26 years, while the Turin Canon stated that the thing did not enter the matter with the 74-year government. Today's egiptologists and historians consider both accounts to be exaggerated and claim Adjib's reign lasted for 8-10 years. Adjib is well attested in the archaeological record. His name appears in inscriptions on ships made of schist, alabaster, brection and marble. Its name is also preserved on ivory tags and earthen jar seals. The object bearing the name and title Adjib is derived from Abydos and Saqqara. Adjib's family was only partially investigated. His parents are unknown, but it is thought that his predecessor, king Den, may have been his father. Adjib probably married a woman named Betrest. In the Palermo Inscription she is depicted as the mother of Adjib's successor, king of Semerkhet. Definitive evidence for that view has not yet been found. It is expected that Adjib had sons and daughters, but their names have not been preserved in the annals. A candidate suspected to be a member of his family is Semerkhet. According to archaeological records, Adjib introduced a new royal title that he said was used as a complement to the title Nisut-Bity: the title Nebuy, which was written with a double sign of an eagle with a short standard. It means \"two rulers\" and refers to the protectors of the divine states of Horus and Seth. It also symbolically points to Lower and Upper Egypt. Adjib is considered to have legitimized his role as king of Egypt by using this title. Clay seal prints record the base of hor's new royal fortress nebw-khet (\"Horus, the gold of the divine community\") and the royal residence of Hor seba-khet (\"Horus, the star of the divine community\"). ", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "The inscription of the ship Batu indicates that during the reign of Adjib an unusually large number of cult statues were made for the king. At least six objects show depictions of standing statues representing the king with royal coat of arms. The stone ship inscription records that Adjib commemorates the first and even second Hebsed (jubilee throne), a feast celebrated first after 30 years of the king's reign, after which it is repeated every third or fourth year. But a recent investigation showed that any object showing the names Hebsed and Adjib was removed from the tomb of king Den. It seems that Adjib just deleted and renamed Den with his own name. This is seen by egiptologists and historians as evidence that Adjib never celebrated a Hebsed and thus his reign was relatively short. Egiptologists such as Nicolas Grimal and Wolfgang Helck considered that Adjib, as den's son and rightful heir to the throne, may have been quite old by the time he ascended the Egyptian throne. Helck also pointed to an unusual feature; All pictures of Hebsed Adjib show the notation Qesen (\"disaster\") inscribed on the steps of the Hebsed pavilion. Perhaps the end of Adjb's reign was a violent one. Adjib's burial site was excavated at Abydos and is known as \"Tomb X\". It measures 16.4 x 9.0 meters and is the smallest of all the royal tombs in this area. Adjib's tomb has an entrance on the east side and a staircase leading inward. This burial chamber is surrounded by 64 children of the tomb and is only divided by a wall cut off into two rooms. Until the end of the first dynasty, it seemed to have been a tradition that the king's family and court committed suicide (or were killed) and then buried next to the ruler in his necropolis.

This architecture is called the client-server model. Servers can provide a variety of functionality, often called \"services,\" such as sharing data or resources among multiple clients, or performing calculations for clients. One server can serve multiple clients, and one client can use multiple servers. The client process can run on the same device or it can connect over the network to a server on different devices. Typical servers are database servers, file servers, mail servers, print servers, web servers, game servers, and application servers. Today's client-server systems are most often implemented by (and often identified with) a request-response model: the client sends a request to the server, which performs several actions and sends a response back to the client, usually with a result or acknowledgment. Designating a computer as \"server-class hardware\" implies that it is devoted to running servers on it. This often implies that it is more powerful and reliable than a standard personal computer, but alternatively, a large computing cluster can consist of many relatively simple and replaceable server components. The use of the word server in computing comes from queuing theory, where the word dates back to the mid-20th century, mainly used in Kendall (1953) (along with \"service\"), a paper introducing Kendall notation. In earlier papers, such as Erlang (1909), more concrete terms such as \"telephone operator\" were used. In computing, \"server\" is at least derived from RFC 5 (1969), one of the earliest documents describing ARPANET (the predecessor of the Internet), and is contrasted with \"user\", which distinguishes two types of hosts: \"server- host \"and \"user-host\". ", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "The use of \"serve\" also comes from early documents, such as RFC 4, which contrasts with \"host-host\" with \"host-use\". File jargon defines \"server\" in the general sense of the process of performing services for requests, usually remote, with a read of version 1981 (1.1.0): SERVER n. A kind of DAEMON that performs services for the requestor, which often runs on a computer other than the one the server is running. Actually, the term server refers to a computer program or process (running a program). Through metonymy, it refers to the device used to (or a device dedicated to) running one or more server programs. In the network, such devices are called hosts. In addition to servers (servers), the words serve and service (such as nouns and verbs) are often used, although waiters and waiters are not.a] Service words (nouns) can refer to abstract forms of functionality, eg. Windows service. Alternatively, it could refer to a computer program that turns a computer into a server, i.e. Windows services. Originally used as \"server serves users\" (and \"users use servers\"), in the sense of \"obedient\", today people often say that \"servers serve data\", in the same sense as \"give\". For example, a web server \"serves a web page for users\" or \"serves their requests\". The server is part of the client-server model; In this model, the server presents data to the client. The nature of communication between the client and the server is the request and response. This is in contrast to the peer-to-peer model where the relationship is a reply to a request. In principle, any computerized process that can be used or invoked by other processes (especially remote, especially for sharing resources) is a server, and a calling process or process is a client. Thus, a general-purpose computer connected to the network can host a server.

This word is often equated with matriarchhat or matriarchy, although it basically means differently. Matrilineal comes from two Latin words, namely mater which means mother, and linea which means line. So, matrilineal means following a lineage drawn from the maternal side. Meanwhile, matriarchhat comes from two Greek words, namely mater which means mother, and archein which means to rule. So, matriarchy means that power is in the hands of the mother or the female side. In matrilineal custom, the child connects himself with his mother (based on the female lineage). This kinship system also connects with the mother's relatives based on the unilateral female lineage. In a society whose structure is matrilineal, heredity according to the maternal line is seen as very important, giving rise to a much tighter and more pervasive familial relationship among its citizens who are similar according to the maternal line which leads to the growth of greater consequences than the paternal lineage. The opposite of matrilineal is patrilineal, which is a community custom that states the flow of offspring comes from the paternal side. Adherents of patrilineal customs in Indonesia as an example are the Batak Tribe, Rejang Tribe, Minahasa Tribe, Sangir Tribe and Gayo Tribe. Patrilineal customs are more commonly used by the world's community than matrilineals which are used less frequently. There are several tribes that uphold matrilineal customs. Some of these tribes are: The Minangkabau community of more than five million people is the largest matrilineal society in the world. Women are heirs to family heirlooms.

The people of Garo live in the state of Meghalaya, in northeastern India. The Garo people use a mixture of Tibetan and Burmese. If a man marries, he lives with his wife or wife's mother. If a woman loses her husband and cannot cultivate her own land, she is entitled to a new husband from the family of her deceased husband. The people of Mosuo live in southwestern China. They lived together as a \"big family,\" and were led by a woman called \"Ah Mi\". Men take care of livestock, especially slaughter. In Mosuo society there is no marriage. A female only needs to come to the man she wants. Children born from their relationships are taken care of by women, and it is often unknown which father it is. If a man from the Hopi Indian tribe marries, his son becomes a member of his wife's clan. But the name of the child is chosen female from the paternal clan, at a feast when he is 20 days old. So if many give names, a child can have many names. But it was his parents who decided which name to use. According to tradition, these Indian peoples in the United States are also matrilocal. But it's not much practiced anymore. In addition to matrilinial, the Navajo Indian tribal communities in the United States are also matrilocal. So if a man marries, he becomes a member of his wife's clan, and lives in the settlement of his wife's clan. Members of a clan may not marry members of the same clan. The basis of the structure of the Navajo society is a large family, where each member has established obligations.

However, according to Nagarakretagama he was never king in the Kingdom of Tumapel. Tohjaya is the son of Ken Arok who was born to a concubine named Ken Umang. After Ken Arok was killed, his stepson, Anusapati, ascended the throne in Tumapel. Tohjaya learns that his father's murderer is none other than Anusapati himself. So, he also devised a revenge plan. Although Anusapati tightened the escort over him, Tohjaya was able to take advantage of his weakness. One day Tohjaya invited Anusapati to eat chickens. Anusapati complied unsuspectingly because it was indeed his favorite. When Anusapati was engrossed in watching the fighting chicken that was fighting, Tohjaya immediately killed him using Mpu Gandring's dagger. The event took place in 1249. Tohjaya later became king of Tumapel. Because of the instigation of his maid named Pranaraja, he also intended to kill his two nephews, namely Ranggawuni (son of Anusapati), and Mahisa Campaka (son of Mahisa Wonga Teleng) whom he considered dangerous to the continuation of the throne. The one charged with killing was the Ampal Ox. But Lembu Ampal actually turned to support the two princes he was about to kill. He even managed to gather support from the Tumapel army to jointly support Ranggawuni - Mahisa Campaka. So there was a rebellion against Tohjaya at the court of Tumapel. Tohjaya was pierced by a spear but managed to escape. Because of his injuries, he eventually died in the village of Katang Lumbang. This event occurred in 1250. Tohjaya's life story is only found in Pararaton, but this manuscript was written hundreds of years after the time of the Tumapel Kingdom so its truth needs to be proven. Nagarakretagama, written in the middle of the Majapahit period (1365), apparently does not mention the name Tohjaya at all. ", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "According to Nagarakretagama, after the death of Anusapati who became the next king was Vishnuwardhana (aka Ranggawuni). Tohjaya's name is actually found in the Mula Malurung inscription issued by Kertanagara by order of his father named Maharaja Seminingrat (the original name of Vishnuwardhana version of the inscription) in 1255. This inscription has proven that Tohjaya is a historical figure who really exists, not just a fictional figure created by Pararaton. However, in the inscription it is written that Tohjaya was not the king of Tumapel or Singhasari, but the king of Kadiri who succeeded his younger brother, named Guningbhaya. Guningbhaya became king after succeeding his brother, Bhatara Parameswara. The three Kadiri kings were uncles of Seminingrat. It is also written that the founder of the Kingdom of Tumapel was Bhatara Shiva who died on the throne, i.e. grandfather of Seminingrat. The Mula Malurung inscription has been reviewed and analyzed by historian Slamet Muljana in his book entitled Nagarakretagama and its Historical Interpretation (1979). In the book he tried to reinterpret the history of the Kingdom of Tumapel based on the inscriptions of Mula Malurung, Nagarakretagama, and Pararaton. The Kadiri Kingdom collapsed in 1222 due to the rebellion of Bhatara Shiva (aka Ken Arok). He then founded the Kingdom of Tumapel where Kadiri became a vassal land, and was handed over to his son Bhatara Parameswara. This made Anusapati jealous who felt that he was the eldest son. Perhaps he was right to kill Bhatara Shiva because according to the inscription of Mula Malurung the first king of Tumapel died on his throne. Meanwhile, after the death of Bhatara Parameswara in Kadiri, the throne fell to his younger brother, named Guningbhaya. Then after Guningbhaya's death the throne fell to his brother, namely Tohjaya. In Pararaton, the character Bhatara Parameswara is synonymous with Mahisa Wonga Teleng, the eldest son of Ken Arok and Ken Dedes.

Flavius Josephus placed Gomer and the \"Gomerites\" in Galatians, Anatolia: \"For Gomer descended people who in Greek were called Galatians, but were formerly called Gomerites.\" The name Galatians is actually taken from the ancient name of Gaul (Kelt) who lived there. However, the Christian writer Hippolitus of Rome in about 234 considered Gomer to be the ancestor of the Cappadoians, in the neighboring region of the Galatians. Jerome (~ in 390) and Isidorus of Seville (~ in 600) follow the identification of Josephus linking Gomer with the Galatians, Gauls and Kelts.

The Assyrians called them Gimmerai ; The Kimmira king Teushpa was defeated by Esarhadon of Assyria between 681 and 668 BC. In Islamic fairy tales, the Persian historian, Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari (~ 915) recounts the Persian tradition, that Gomer lived to the age of 1000, knowing that this age matched Nimrod, but no one else exceeded it recorded in the book of the Torah.

Diglycerides can also be converted back into triglycerides with the addition of a third fatty acid by being catalyzed by the acyltransferase diglyceride enzyme. Diglycerides are a minor component of many grain oils, and generally range from 1 to 6%, with the exception of cottonseed oil, it can reach 10%. In industry, generally diglycerides are produced from the glycerolysis process between triglycerides and glycerol. With raw materials can be from plant or animal fat. DAG can act as a surfactant and is commonly used as a food emulsifier. For emulsifying agents in the food industry such as E471, it is produced from a mixture of diglycerides with monoglycerides .

The meaning of Christ's presence for Christians is believed to be the preserver and savior of the world in relation to every matter of life. Themes such as feminism, Liberation theology or independence are themes that are currently popular in modern times, in which Christians continue to reflect on the meaning of Christ. These themes are due to the oppression by war, \"exclusivism\", social inequalities in society, and the sometimes unjust state system of the entire creation, including nature. Christology that is lived in natural conditions damaged by global warming is called Ecological Christology. A christology that focuses on the whole creation is called Cosmic Christology. Some even describe eighteen images of Jesus Christ with the ever-changing culture of customs. In the division of the old and scientific ways, Christology is included in the family of Systematic Theology-Dogmatics.. Christology for Christians is the revelation (revelation) of God to man through the coming of Christ.

Many ATMs also serve money storage or checks, money transfers or even buying mobile phone credit. ATMs are often placed in strategic locations, such as restaurants, shopping malls, airports, train stations, bus terminals, supermarkets, and the offices of the banks themselves. The idea of out-of-hours cash distribution was developed from banking needs in Asia (Japan), Europe (Sweden and the United Kingdom) and North America (United States). Little is known about this type of device in Japan than the so-called \"Loan Computer Machine\" which gives cash as a three-month loan of 5%, after entering the credit card. The device went into service in 1966. In the patent records of the United States, Luther George Simjian has been credited for the development of the \"previous invention device\". Specifically its 132nd patent (US3079603), which was first filed on June 30, 1960 (and granted on February 26, 1963). The device, called Bankograph, was delayed by several years, as a result of the Simjian company Reflectone Electronics Inc. which was acquired by Universal Match Corporation. A Bankograph experiment was installed in New York City in 1961 by the City Bank of New York, but was removed after six months due to lack of customer acceptance. Bankograph is an automatic envelope storage machine (accepts coins, cash and checks) and does not have a cash withdrawal feature.

The invention is credited to an engineering team led by John Shepherd-Barron of the De La Rue printing company, which was awarded the OBE in 2005. The transaction begins with inserting a paper check issued by the teller or cashier, marked with carbon-14 for machine reading and security, which in the latter model is matched with a six-digit Personal Identification Number (PIN). The idea of storing a PIN on a card was developed by a British Engineer working on MD2 named James Goodfellow in 1965 (patent GB1197183 was filed on 2 May 1966 with Anthony Davies). The essence of this system is that it allows verification of customers with debited accounts without human intervention. This patent is also an early example of the complete \"currency storage system\" in the patent record. This patent was filed on March 5, 1968 in the United States (US 3,543,904) and granted on December 1, 1970. This has a huge influence on the industry as a whole. Not only did future entrants into the cash storage market such as NCR Corporation and IBM license Goodfellow's PIN system, but a number of later patents referenced these patents as \"previous invention devices\". ATMs typically consist of the following devices: Due to the heavier computing demands and falling prices of machine architectures such as Personal Computers, ATMs have moved away from custom hardware architectures using microcontrollers and/or application-specific integrated circuits to adopting the hardware architecture of a Personal Computer, such as, USB connections for peripherals, Ethernet and IP communications, and using personal computer operating systems. While it is undoubtedly cheaper to use commercial hardware \"out of the box\", this makes ATMs potentially vulnerable to the same type of problems demonstrated by conventional Personal Computers.

They consist of all synapsides that do not include therapsida and its offspring. Since a more sophisticated synapsida group called Therapsida evolved directly from Pelycosauria, Pelycosauria is a paraphyletic group. Thus the name Pelycosauria, similar to the term mammal-like reptile, was disliked by scientists in the 21st century, and is only used informally, if at all, in modern scientific literature. The term pelycosaur has been quite well abandoned by paleontologists because it no longer matches the distinguishing feature of the clad.citation needed] The modern word is derived from the Greek p\u00e9lyx meaning 'wooden bowl' or 'axe' and sa\u00fbros meaning 'lizard'. The etymology in question presents a problem, since the invented Pelycosauria basically means 'basin lizard', but there is a vagueness between some of the original Greek words that p\u00e9lix is 'wooden bowl' and pel\u00edk\u0113 is 'hollow', while p\u00e9lyx is 'axe' (like p\u00e9lekys 'double-edged axe').citation needed] Pelycosauria is a paraphyletic taxon because it does not include Therapsida. For that reason, the term is sometimes avoided by proponents of a strict cladistic approach. Eupelycosauria is used to signify a clade that includes most pelycosauria, along with Therapsida and Mammalia. In contrast to the \"pelycosauria\", Eupelycosauria is an appropriate monophyletic group. Caseasauria is a side branch of pelycosauria, or clad, that leaves no single offspring.citation needed] Pelycosauria appears to be a group of synapsides that have a direct ancestral relationship with mammals, have differentiated teeth and a developed hard palate.

More specifically, malagizi is defined as \"a deficiency, excess, or imbalance of energy, protein, or other nutrients\" that adversely affects body tissues and body shape. Malagizi is a category of disease that includes malnutrition and overnutrition. Malnutrition can result in growth inhibition, catechia, and weight gain. Overnutrition can lead to overweight and obesity. In some developing countries, overnutrition in the form of obesity begins to appear in the same communities as malnutrition. A person will experience malagizi if they do not consume sufficient amounts or quality of nutrients for a healthy diet for a long period of time. Prolonged malagizi can result in starvation, disease, and infection. Some of the symptoms and signs of malagizi are pale and dry skin, easy bruising, skin rashes, changes in skin pigment, pain in the joints, gums bleeding easily, difficulty conserating, dizziness, depression and anxiety. Malagizi is a common medical condition and at least every country is infected with at least one type of malagizi. Women, toddlers, children, and adolescents tend to be more susceptible to malagizi. Malagizi in children, especially in the early 1000 days of life, can cause stunting and this affects their quality of life into adulthood. In addition, malagizi contributes to 45% of deaths of children under the age of five. One of the signs of malnutrition or malnutrition in toddlers is that the toddler's weight is below the red line in the Card Towards Health (KMS).

Pediatric patients can be said to be malnourished if they have lost weight by more than 2% for less than 7 days of treatment, 5% in 8-30 days of treatment or more than 10% for more than 30 days of treatment. Malnutrition can be caused by food intake deficiencies, social isolation, dependence on alcohol or drugs, poverty, eating disorders, mental health conditions and side effects of drugs. Whereas in children it is generally caused by lack of appetite, indigestion, and increased energy needs needed by the body, exposed to parasitic infections, measles, diarrhea, malaria, drinking dirty water, AIDS, liver disease, kidney disease and lack of additional nutritional intake. In elderly people, nutritional status is closely related to functional capacity. The risk of malnutrition in old age was found to be 8.6% in women and 5.6% in men. There are also factors that affect malnutrition in elderly people, such as difficulty chewing, swallowing and feeling food (can be due to inadequate oral care in the elderly, decreased sense of taste, loss of teeth, disease factors and the type of food provided) as well as cognitive impairment that causes the elderly to experience physical, psychic and social deterioration so that their lives depend on others. Malnutrition conditions can be checked through physical checks with doctors, blood tests and urine tests.

Kanji is one of four sets of scripts used in modern Japanese writing in addition to kana (katakana, hiragana) and romaji. Kanji used to be also called mana (\u771f\u540d) or shinji (\u771f\u5b57) to distinguish it from kana. Kanji script is used to symbolize a concept or idea (noun, verb root, adjective root, and adverb). Meanwhile, hiragana (ancient katakana) was commonly used as okurigana to write inflections of verbs and words whose roots were written with kanji, or words native to the Japanese language. In addition, hiragana is used to write words that are difficult to write and remember when written in kanji script. Except for the word absorption, the kanji script is used to write almost all vocabulary derived from both Chinese and Japanese. Officially, the Chinese script was first known in Japan through goods imported from China through the Korean Peninsula starting in the 5th century AD. Since then, Chinese script has been widely used for writing in Japan, including for stone inscriptions and other items. Earlier in the early 3rd century AD, two men named Achiki and Wani came from Baekje during the reign of Emperor \u014cjin. Both are said to be teachers of Chinese script for the emperor's son. Wani brought Kong Hu Chu's Analek book and a Chinese script writing textbook for children with the title A Thousand Characters Classic.

In addition, they also write down various important events and events. Before the kanji script was known to the Japanese, the Japanese language developed without a written form. At first, Japanese documents were written in Chinese, and they were pronounced according to the way they read Chinese. The kanbun system (\u6f22\u6587) is a way of writing Japanese according to Chinese with diacritic marks. When read, diacritic marks help Japanese speakers change the arrangement of words, add particles, and inflections according to Japanese grammar rules. Subsequently, a man'y\u014dgana writing system developed that used Chinese script to symbolize Japanese sounds. This system is used in the classical poetry anthology Man'y\u014dsh\u016b. When writing man'y\u014dgana, the Chinese script is written in cursive form to save time. The result is hiragana which is a simple form of man'y\u014dgana. Hiragana became a writing system that women could easily master. The literature of the Heian period was colored by the great works of women literati who wrote in hiragana. Meanwhile, katakana was created by monks who took only a small part of the scribbles from some of the kanji characters used in man'y\u014dgana. One kanji script can have different ways of reading. In addition, it is not uncommon, one sound can be denoted by different kanji characters. The kanji script has two ways of pronunciation, Chinese utterances (on'yomi) and Japanese sayings (kun'yomi). On'yomi (\u97f3\u8aad\u307f) or Chinese speech is a way of reading kanji following the way Chinese people read when the character was introduced in Japan.

Rakaat is a number of movements that must be done in prayer (from Takbiratul Ikhram to sitting between two prostrations). The shortest Muslim fardu prayer is the dawn prayer, performed shortly before sunrise. It consists of two rakaats. The rakaat movement can be described as follows: Points 1-7 determine one rakaat.

Serval is nocturnal, so it mostly hunts at night, unless disturbed by human activity or the presence of predators. Although the serval often catches rodents, it also preys on birds, hares, Hyraxes, reptiles, insects, fish and frogs. Serval sometimes hunts animals larger than himself, such as deer, gazel, and springbok.

This ruler is known through a tragic legend declared by the Ancient Greek historian, Manetho, who reported that a disaster occurred during the reign of Semerkhet. The archaeological record seems to support the view that Semerkhet had a difficult time like a king and some early archaeologists even questioned the validity of Semerkket's succession to the Egyptian throne. Manetho appointed Semerkhet as Sem\u00eamps\u00e9s and declared his reign to last for 18 years, while the Turin Canon stated that he reigned for 72 years. Egyptologists and historians now consider both statements to be boasts and claim Semerkhet reigned for 81/2 years. This evaluation is based on the Cairo Stone inscription, on which the complete reign of Semerkhet is recorded. In addition, they point to the archaeological record, which reinforces the view that Semerkhet had a relatively short reign. Semerkhet is well attested in the archaeological record. His name appears in inscriptions on ships made of schist, alabaster, brexit and marble. Its name is also preserved on ivory tags and earthen vessel seals. The objects carrying the name and title of Semerkhet are from Abydos and Saqqara. The name serekh Semerkhet is usually translated as \"friend of the divine community\" or \"friend of wisdom\". This last translation is questioned by many scientists, since the hieroglyphic khet (Gardiner F32-sign) is usually a symbol for the \"body\" or \"divine community\". Semerkket's birth name is more problematic. Each artifact showing his birth name strangely lacks the artistic details of the hieroglyphic marks used: a man walking in a waving cloak or skirt, a nemes head dress, and a long scepter in his hand. The reading and meaning of this particular sign is disputed, since it did not appear in this form before it came into contact with king Semerkhet.

During the time of the Old Kingdom, the word was written with uniliter signs of the netjer flag (Gardiner-sign R8) and the human eye (Gardiner-sign D4) near the man's ideography. Some contemporary ivory tags indicate Nebty's name written with a single-eyed symbol only. Thus, scientists also read the name of the throne of Semerkhet as Iry (meaning \"guardian\") and the name Nebty as Iry-Nebty (meaning \"guardian of the Two Mistresses\"). This reconstruction is reinforced by the observation that Semerkhet was the first king to use the title Nebty in his final form. For unknown reasons, Semerkhet did not use the title Nebuy from his predecessor. It seems that he felt connected to 'Two Women', a title referring to the goddesses Nekhbet and Wadjet, the patron gods of the Ancient Egyptians worshipped by everyone after the union of his two parts, Lower Egypt, and Upper Egypt. The title of Nebty in turn is considered to serve as an addition to the title of Nisut-Bity.

In tracytes there is almost always a small amount of plagioclase, usually oligoclase; But felspar calcium (sanidin) often contains a certain amount of felspar sodium (albit), and has more characteristics of anarchoxa or cryptopertite than pure sanidine. Porphyry rombics are examples of rocks with rhombic porphyritic phenocrysts embedded in a very fine matrix. Quartz is usually rare in tracytes, but tridymites (which are also composed of silica) are by no means rare. Tridimite is rarely present in the form of crystals large enough to be visible without the help of a microscope, but in thin incisions may appear small hexagonal plates, which overlap and form solid aggregates, such as mosaics or like tiles on the roof.

In older tracytes, secondary quartz is not uncommon, and may sometimes be the result of recrystallization of tridymite. Of all the mafic minerals present, augite is the most common mineral. Augit is usually pale green, and its small crystalline shape is often very perfectly shaped. brown hornblende and biotite can also form, and are usually surrounded by a black corrosion boundary around it consisting of magnetite and pyroxene; Sometimes the replacement of the corrosion that occurs has been completed and there is no hornblende or biotite left. The outline of magnetite and augite clusters may clearly indicate where these minerals come from. Olivin is not commonly present, but is found in some trasites, such as those of Arso in Ischia. Common variants of plagioclase, such as labradorite, are found as phenocrysts in some tracytes in Italy. Dark brown variants of augit, and rhombic-shaped pyroxene (hypersten or bronzit) have been found but are not common. Apatite, zircon and magnetite are practically always present as accessory minerals. Trasit. which is very rich in potassium feldspar, necessarily containing a sufficient amount of alkali; In this character they approach phonolites. Sometimes minerals from the felspatoid group, such as nephelins, sodalites, and leusites, occur, and this type of rock is known as phonolithic trasite. Tracytes are well represented among the volcanic rocks of European Cenozoic. In England they occur in Skye as lava flows and as dike intrusions, but they are much more common in continental Europe, such as in the districts of Rhein and Eifel, as well as in Auvergne, Bohemia and Euganean Hills.

The language is dynamic, concatenative and created by John Warnock, Charles Geschke, Doug Brotz, Ed Taft and Bill Paxton in 1982. It is used as a page description language in electronic publishing environments and computer desks. The concept of the PostScript language originated with John Gaffney of Evans & Sutherland in 1976. At that time, John Gaffney and John Warnock were developing interpreters for a three-dimensional graphics database for New York Harbor. At the same time, scientists at Xerox PARC also developed the first laser printer and they realized the need to standardize how to define pages. In 1975-1976, Bob Sproull and William Newman developed the Press format that was eventually used on the Xerox Star system to control laser printers. However, Press is a data format instead of a programming language so it is not suitable for their needs. Eventually PARC developed Interpress. John Warnock and Chuck Geschke founded Adobe Systems in December 1982. They along with Doug Brotz, Ed Taft, and Bill Paxton created a simpler language similar to Interpress called PostScript. The language went on the market in 1982. In March 1985, the Apple LaserWriter was the first printer to use PostScript. PostScript is a Turing-complete programming language, and is in a concatenation group. Usually, PostScript programs are not written by humans, but by other programs. However, writing computer programs in PostScript is possible, just like any other programming language. PostScript is an interpreted language, stack-based just like Forth but with dynamic powerful types, Lisp-inspired data structures, memory enclosed and, since a level 2 language, garbage collection.

Satire not only has the characteristic of being a strong irony or sarcasm.\u2014\"irony is militant in satire\", according to the literary critique put forward by Northrop Frye\u2014 but it is also a parody, burlesque, exaggerated statement, alignment, comparison, analogy, and double entendre that is also often used in writings and sayings containing satirical elements. Satire is found in many forms of artistic expression, including internet memes, literary works, plays, commentary, music, film and television performances, and medium of expression such as lyrics. The word satire comes from the Latin words, satur and lanx satura if written with the phrase that started with it. Satur means \"full\", but when interpreted by lanx jux, this word changes to \"assorted or mixed\": this is because lanx satura literally means \"a dish that contains a wide variety of fruits\". The word satura as used by the Quintilians, is usually only used as a designation for satire in Roman poetry, a strict genre that imposes a hexameter shape, a genre narrower than satire today.

The helmet can provide additional protection to part of the head (depending on its structure) from falling or high-speed objects. In some countries, helmets are mandatory for motorcyclists, some even require them for non-motorcyclists. In the UK only Sikhs are allowed not to wear helmets because they have to wear turbans.

It can be said that there is no other use of helmets other than war purposes. The helmet protects the head from the slash of the opponent's weapon, the arrival of arrows, or even low-speed bullets (from early rifles such as arquebuses). Helmet use declined since 1670 when the efficiency and speed of rifle bullets increased considerably. In the 18th century absolutely no infantry used it anymore. The Napoleonic era became the inauguration of the use of helmets for cavalrymen. The use of heavy artillery in World War I showed the need to use helmets for ordinary soldiers to reduce casualties due to bomb fragments or schrapnels.

ITSM focuses on processes and is therefore related and shares the same interests as process improvement movement frameworks and methodologies (such as TQM, Six Sigma, Business Process Management, and CMMI). This discipline does not care about the details of the use of a particular supplier's products or the technical details of a managed system, but rather focuses on providing a framework for structuring IT-related activities and interactions between IT technical personnel and information technology users. ITSM generally handles the operational issues of information technology management (sometimes called operations architecture) and not on the development of its own technology. For example, the process of creating computer software for sale is not the focus of this discipline, but rather the computer systems used by the marketing and business development department of software companies that are the focus of his attention. There are also many non-technology companies, such as the financial, retail, and tourism industries, that have IT systems that play an important role, even though they are not directly exposed to their consumers. In keeping with this function, ITSM is often thought of as an analogy of the ERP discipline in IT, although its history rooted in IT operations can limit its application to other key IT activities such as IT portfolio management and software engineering.

Biblos is believed to have been inhabited for the first time between 8800 and 7000 BC, and according to fragments made by the legendary Phoenician priest from pre-Homer's time named Sanchuniathon, the city was first built by Cronus as the first city in Phoenicia. It is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world and a site that has been continuously inhabited since 5000 BC. It is now declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and is one of the tourism objects in Lebanon.

He was Roman Governor of the Milan-based regions of Liguria and Emilia, before being elected by acclamation Bishop of Milan by the townspeople in 374. Ambrosius was a staunch opponent of Arianism, and was charged with inciting the people to persecute the Arianists, the Jews, and the pagans. According to tradition, Ambrosius is a figure who has popularized the \"antiphonal langgam\", which is a way of singing in a row, and a composer of veni redemptor gentium, an advent madah. He also diligently observed the condition of Italian society in his time. Ambrosius was one of the four early Church Poets, and was revered as the patron saint of the city of Milan. He is known as a figure who has influenced the life of Augustine of Hipo. Ambrosius was born into a Roman Christian family around 340. He grew up in Gallia Belgica, a region of the Roman Empire that housed the city of Augusta Treverorum. It is sometimes narrated that his father was Aurelius Ambrosius, Prefect of Pretoria Gaul (Latin: praefectus praetorio Galliarum); but according to some scholars, his father was an official named Uranius who received the imperial charter dated February 3, 339 (mentioned in a brief quotation of the decree of one of the three emperors in 339, Constantine II, Constantius II, or Constans, which is contained in the Codex Theodosianus, Book XI.5). His mother was a bright, pious woman, the daughter of an elite Roman family, Aurelii Symmachi, and therefore Ambrosius was still a cousin of the accomplished orator Quintus Aurelius Symmachus. Ambrosius was the youngest of three younger siblings. His older brothers were Marselina and Satirus (figures in Ambrosius' De excessu fratris Satyri), who were also revered as saints.

That is why, images of bees and beehives often appear in the symbology of this saint. After the death of his father, Ambrosius left for Rome, where he studied literature, law, and rhetoric. He then followed in his late father's footsteps to become a government employee. Pretoria Sextus Prefect Claudius Petronius Probus first gave him a seat in the council and then approximately in 372 made him governor of the regions of Liguria and Emilia, with the seat of government in the city of Milan which was then the second Roman capital (after the city of Rome) in Italy. Ambrosius served as Governor of Liguria and Emilia in northern Italy until being elected Bishop of Milan in 374. He was a much-loved political figure, and as a governor based in the effective capital of Western Rome, he also emerged as a prominent figure among the court assemblies of Emperor Valentinian I. At the end of the 4th century, there was a fierce conflict in the Diocese of Milan between the Trinitarians and the Arianists. In 374, Auxentius, Bishop of Milan died and orthodox and Arianist groups competed with each other to become his successors. The prefect went personally to the basilica, where the election was to be held, to prevent the unrest that might ensue in this crisis. His speech was interrupted by the cry \"Raise Ambrosius to bishop!\" which was then followed by others so that he was acclamationally appointed bishop. Ambrosius was a strong candidate in these circumstances, as he was known to be sympathetic to the Trinitarianists, but was also accepted by the Arianists because his position as a politician was considered theologically neutral.

It is an \"ultraconservative\", \"hard\", or \"puritanical\" school of Islam; Supporters of this school believe that their movement is an Islamic \"reform movement\" to return to the \"teachings of pure monotheism\", return to the true teachings of Islam, which are based only on the Qur'an and Hadith, clean from all \"impurities\" such as the practices of heresy, shirk and khurafat. While opponents of this teaching refer to Wahhabi as a \"deviant sectarian movement\", a \"vile sect\" and a distortion of Islamic teachings. According to a Saudi writer, Abdul Aziz Qasim and others, the first to give the nickname \"Wahabi\" to ibn Abdul Wahhab's proselytizing was the Ottoman Empire, then the British adopted and used it in the Middle East. Wahhabiyah or Wahabi adherents dislike the term that some of these circles attach to them and reject embedding individual names, including using someone's name to name their tradition. They named themselves Salafi and the movement Salafiyah. Abdul Aziz bin Abdullah bin Baz said: \"The (Wahhabiyah) blasphemy is not in accordance with the rules of the Arabic language. Even if there should be a new understanding brought by Al-Shaikh Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab, the form of blasphemy is 'Muhammadiyah', because the proselytizer and the perpetrator of the proselytizing is Muhammad, not his father named Abdul Wahhab.\" The terms \"Wahabi\" and \"Salafi\" (as well as the Hadith Experts i.e. the hadith people) are often used interchangeably, but Wahabi has also been referred to as \"a certain orientation in Salafism\", which is considered ultra-conservative. ", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "But it can be concluded, Wahabi is a sunni Islamic movement that aims to purify Islamic teachings from deviant teachings or practices such as: shirk, black magic, idolatry, heresy and khurafat. .  The main proselytizing is Tawhid, which is the Oneness and Unity of God. Ibn Abdul Wahhab was influenced by the writings of Ibn Taymiyyah and questioned the interpretation of Islam by relying on the Koran and hadith. He targeted the \"perceived moral decline and political weakness\" in the Arabian Peninsula and condemned idolatry, the cult of saints, the worship of the graves of the righteous, and forbade the making of cemeteries places of worship. The Wahhabi movement began as a revivalist movement in the remote, arid region of Najd. With the collapse of the Ottoman Empire after World War I, the Al Saud dynasty became the main supporter of Wahhabism, and spread to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. After the discovery of oil near the Persian Gulf in 1939, the Saudi Kingdom had access to oil export revenues, revenues that grew to billions of dollars. This money - used to spread wahhabi proselytizing through books, media, schools, universities, mosques, scholarships, scholarships, jobs for Islamic journalists, academics and scientists - gives Wahhabism a \"superior position of power\" in the global Islamic World. Wahhabi first entered Indonesia in the early 19th century. The relationship between the teachings of the \"Wahabi\" people and the Minangkabau people in West Sumatra began through the return of three Hajj; Hajj Miskin, Haji Sumanik and Haji Piobang, who had just returned from hajj in 1803. Their pilgrimage coincided with the control of Mecca by the Wahhabis. The influence can be seen from the opposition to the practice of heresy, the use of tobacco for either betel nut or smoking, and the wearing of silk clothes.

For this reason, these storms are sometimes referred to as rotating thunderstorms. Of the four classifications of thunderstorms (supercell, squall line, multicell, and single-cell), supercell is the most common overall and has the potential to be the most severe. Supercells are often isolated from other thunderstorms, and can dominate the local climate for 32 kilometres (20 mi). Supercells are usually found isolated from other storms, although they can sometimes be embedded in storm lines. Typically, supercells are found in the warm sector of a low pressure system that propagates in a general northeasterly direction in line with the cold front of a low pressure system. Because it can last for hours, these storms are known as semi-steady-state storms. Supercells have the ability to deviate from the average wind. If they follow to the right or left the average wind (relative to vertical wind sliding), they are referred to as \"right drive\" or \"left drive\", respectively. Supercell can sometimes develop two separate updrafts with opposite rotations, which divide the storm into two supercells: one left drive and one right drive. Supercells can be in different sizes \u2013 large or small, low or high. They usually produce a lot of hail, heavy rain, strong winds, and substantial heavy rain.

Tefillin-hand or shel-yed was used by Jews to be wrapped around their arms, hands, and fingers, while Tefillin-head or shel-rosh was placed on the forehead. Torah mentions Tefillin should be used for service as a \"sign\" and \"reminder\" that God brought the children of Israel out of Egypt. Tefillin is a cube-shaped leather box painted black with a black leather tie on one side. Jews use it on their heads and upper arms during morning worship on weekdays. This tradition has been active for thousands of years. Devout Jews considered using tefilim to be a very grand mitzvah (commandment). The source text for tefilim in Torah is not clear in literal meaning. For example, the following verse from Shema mentions: \"Thou shalt also bind it as a sign to thy hand, and it shall be the totafot of thy dahim.\" The verse does not refer to what is specifically to \"tie it to your hands,\" and the definition of totafot itself is unclear\u2014the only other use of the word is in verses of the same context (Ex. 13:16 & Deuteronomy 11:18). But the authoritative oral tradition (Torah Oral) explains that scripture gives the message that the scriptures (including Shema) be bound to the body in the form of Tefillin. This is the Oral Torah that provides details of the interpretation and application of Tefillin. The obligation on tefillin is mentioned four times in the Torah.

This word is difficult to translate & understand. The term \"tefillin\" itself is found in Talmudik literature. Although the word totafot in the Bible is still current, it was later translated as \"frontlet\" in English > \"emblem\" in the LAI version of the Bible. In rabbinic literature, the form is not translated into foreign languages. The Septuaginta translates \"totafot\" as \u1f00\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc\u03bd meaning \"something immovable\". A reference in the English translation of the Christian Bible calls it \"phylacteries\", from Greek \"phulakt rion\" means \"place of the guard\" or \"guard\" of the word phulakt r, guard, from the word phulax or phulak. However, neither Aquila nor Symmachus used the word \"phylacteries\". Targum Onkelos and Pesyita translate the word \"totafot\" as tefillin. Tur wrote that the word \"tefillin\" is derived from the word \"pelilah\" meaning proof, because tefillin acts as a sign & proof that Shekhinah is attached to the Jews. Excavations at Qumran in the Judean Desert in 1955 indicated a widespread use of thefilim during the Second Temple period. Excavations revealed the earliest remaining tefilim.

Together with Diocletian, he launched a scorched earth campaign on the territory of the Alamanni tribe in 288, which succeeded in securing the Rhein provinces from the threat of Germanic tribes. Carousel, the man he appointed to guard the coast of the English strait, rebelled in 286. As a result, Britain and northwestern Gaul were off the Romans. Maximianus failed to take down Carousian, and his fleet was destroyed by a storm in 289 or 290. Constantius (Maximian's subordinate) then launched an attack on Allectus (Carousian's successor), while Maximianus took care of the Rhein front. Allectus was overthrown in 296, and Maximianus then moved south to fight pirates near Hispania and stop the Berbers' attack on Mauretania. After the military campaign was completed in 298, he lived in luxury in Italy until 305. By order of Diocletian, Maximianus resigned on May 1, 305 and ceded the post of Augustus to Constantius. He then rested in southern Italy. At the end of 306, Maximianus held the title of Augustus again and helped his son rebel in Italy. In April 307, he tried to bring down his son, but failed and fled to the court of Constantine's successor, Constantine (who was Maximian's step-grandson and son-in-law), in Trier.

Its existence began to be recorded in the 8th Dynasty (mentioned in Moalla) and beyond. Its name was reconstructed by Egyptologists as *\u02bbA\u02bcp\u0101p\u012b, and was written \ua725\ua723pp(y) and survives further in Coptic as Aph\u014dph. Apep formed part of the intricate array of universes from identifying Ra as Atum, thus creating Atum-Ra, and the subsequent union of the Ogdoad and Ennead systems. For this reason, Atum-Ra, later referred to simply as Ra, was the sun god, the bearer of light, and the buttress of Ma'at. Apep was seen as Ra's great enemy, and he got the title of Enemy from Ra. As the embodiment of evil, Apep is depicted as a giant snake, sometimes depicted as a dragon in later periods, so he earned the title of Serpent from the Nile and the Evil Lizard. Because of its size, by Egyptologist Apep was drawn as a python, this image is not appropriate because Apep is described as having the ability and never to entangle and strangle its prey. Some more detailed explanations even describe him as having a body 16 yards long and his head made of stone. Also depicted in a bowl of Naqada I (circa 4000 BC) (kept in the Cairo Museum) a serpent depicted on the inner bank combined with various desert and water animals that may depict enemies of the gods, especially enemies of the sun god, who are hunting on rowboats. The ferocious serpent of the sun god's enemy was also mentioned in other names (in the manuscripts of the Pyramids and Coffin Manuscripts) before the name Apep appeared. The etymology of his name ('3pp) probably comes from a Western Semitic mahasa who mentions the root word 'pp means 'melata'.

This movement was preceded by the issuance of the ultimatum of the Charter of the Struggle to Save the State from the Council of Struggle led by Ahmad Husein in Padang, West Sumatra, Indonesia. PRRI originated from the demands of Central Sumatran military and civilian leaders regarding regional autonomy and decentralization. Ahmad Hussein declared PRRI on February 15, 1958 after feeling that the government was not proactive in responding to these demands. The central government saw PRRI as a separatist movement and quelled it with the largest deployment of military force ever recorded in Indonesian military history. PRRI, which was not prepared for war, was forced to face the military operation. The military operation to crush PRRI took heavy casualties on the PRRI side. The number of casualties due to the short PRRI conflict was much greater than the casualties of the war with the Netherlands during the Indonesian National Revolution. In addition, many uninvolved PRRI were killed and subjected to violence such as torture, robbery, and rape. Post-PRRI, the Minang people received a hard mental blow; It used to be at the forefront of the national independence struggle but is now branded as a separatist rebel. PRRI marks the end of the history of the Masyumi Party and the Indonesian Socialist Party. Both parties were disbanded by President Sukarno because they were considered involved in PRRI. Meanwhile, the influence of the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) has strengthened in West Sumatra. Many civil servants who supported PRRI were replaced with communists.

In addition, they also demanded the abolition of a centralized system of government that has led to an unhealthy bureaucratic system, congestion of regional development, and loss of regional initiatives. To fight for the Bull Charter, a Bull Council was formed under the leadership of Lieutenant Colonel Ahmad Husein. The Bull Council consists of 17 members, eight of them from active or retired officers, two from the police, and seven others from civilians, clerics, political leaders, and officials. The establishment of the Bull Council was followed by similar councils in various regions, namely: the Elephant Council in North Sumatra led by Colonel Maludin Simbolon; Garuda Council in South Sumatra led by Lieutenant Colonel Barlian; and the Manguni Council in North Sulawesi led by Lieutenant Colonel Ventje Sumual.

Hawaii is the only state in the U.S. that is separated from the American continent and is an archipelago and belongs to the Oceania region. The islands were discovered by James Cook, a British explorer on 10 January 1778. The indigenous people of the Hawaiian islands are a Hawai'i tribe descended from the Polynesians. The origin of the word Hawaiian comes from the Proto-Polynesian (Old Polynesian) language, *Sawaiki meaning \"Motherland\".

As one of the sports, bridge is under the World Bridge Federation (WBF) which was founded in 1958. Meanwhile in Indonesia, national bridge athletes are covered by a parent organization called Gabungan Bridge Seluruh Indonesia (GABSI) which has been established since 1953 and began to join the WBF Organization in 1960. National bridge day is celebrated every November 12. The beginning of the bridge game was carried out in England around the beginning of the 16th century. Bridge was first popular in the 1860s among Greek, Turkish, Armenian, Russian merchants and diplomats and the Eastern Mediterranean region. China's supreme leader Deng Xiaoping loved the bridge game until he was once the chairman of the Chinese Bridge Association. The bridge game entering Indonesia is thought to have been brought by the Dutch people in the 1880s. GABSI was only formed on December 12, 1953, while the first national championship in Yogyakarta could be held in 1957. The steps in the mini bridge game include the following. To improve defense capabilities, there are 10 basic rules that need to be mastered. The European Union has asserted that bridge games are not sporting activities. The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has categorically rejected a lawsuit recognizing bridge as a sporting activity that has been filed by the English Bridge Union (EBU). The decision of the European Court of Justice is already unanimous that the bridge is not considered a sporting activity, as it does not qualify for significant physical elements when conducting the game. The lawsuit judge submitted that the bridge involves only logic, memory, planning, and may be considered beneficial to mental and physical health, not to actual sports activities.

Meanwhile, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has recognized bridge as a sport since its inception in 1998.

At the 2018 Asian Games, there were six categories contested, namely men team, mixed team, women team, super mixed team, men pair, and mixed. In a study conducted in 2014 announced by the University of Wisconsin-Madison it has been found in playing cards in order to help older people maintain instinctual acuity. The researchers' discovery was that the frequency of playing cards was related to brain volume in some areas heavily affected by Alzheimer's disease. The players also scored higher on cognitive tests more often. Looking at the kind of bridge game that relies heavily on memory, bridge is considered a game of improving the cognitive function of the brain and concentration power. Although there is no scientific research that states that bridges can prevent a person from dementia or Alzheimer's. The most important thing is that this game is still suitable for the elderly. Not only that, but bridge games can be the most effective form of relaxation. Bridge is called the most calming thing because it is in the category of very difficult games, the solution is also difficult to find, but the consequences of decision-making mistakes only make losing points in a row.

The unity of structure in discourse is abstract so as to distinguish it from text, writing, reading, utterance, or inscription in the same sense. While the similarity is that both have concrete forms that are visible, legible, or audible. Discourse is composed of complete language elements ranging from phonemes to whole essays. The elements of language that make up a discourse are cohesion. Discourse is formed through the context of certain cultural situations and social conditions. The appearance of this condition is very clear in the type of oral discourse whose speech uses a certain language in a certain environment. Discourse analysis can use two levels, namely discourse analysis that is only at the level of manuscripts, or critical discourse analysis whose analysis includes manuscripts, context and history. Discourse includes the scientific branch of theoretical linguistics. In linguistics, discourse is part of pragmatics with a wider scope of study compared to clauses and sentences. In addition to linguistic studies, the term \"discourse\" is also widely used in the fields of language education, philosophy and sociology. Modifications to the discourse can turn one common event into several different versions of the story. Discourse is the most complete unit of language and can be realized into a form. The real embodiment of discourse is in the form of essays or reports with intact content. The definition of discourse is synonymous with text. What the two have in common is that they use references in the form of a broader language than clauses or sentences. While the difference between the two is in terms of usage. Discourse is oral so it is interactive, while text is written and not interactive. In the definition of text, discourse manifests into text form because it is a verbal recording of a communication.

Second, in standard words that already have their own meanings. Meanwhile, the current one is in analogy. Meanwhile, in a discourse that is widely discussed, the element of space is found in three things. First, the designation of the direction of a particular place. Second, on the behavior of the character depicted through dialogue. Third, on the description directly conveyed by the author. In discussions about discourse there is an element of context. Types of context in discourse include the context of situations involving social contexts. In addition, the general social context also includes a cultural context. There are also experts who state that the context of the situation is separate from the social context and the cultural context. One of them was Bronis\u0142aw Malinowski.

Malinowski argues that failure to understand a utterance can occur when the context of the situation is ignored. He concluded this after conducting a translation of speech in the Kiriwinian language in the Trobriand Islands community which belongs to the Pacific Islands region. Discourse requires ideology because the function of its existence in speech and understanding of the world requires a certain way. Meanwhile, the process of discourse requires language. The ideology contained in the language is inseparable in the discourse. Therefore, in the discourse there is also a relationship between language and ideology.

This teaching of Unitarianism rejects the issue of the Trinity which says that God is three persons who become one. This teaching of the Trinity is a teaching on the character of Christ that was embraced by both Luther and Calvin in the age of the reformation. In addition to the issue of the Trinity, Unitarianism also rejects the doctrine of original sin and Predestination. In terms of teaching and worship, it does not offer prayers to Christ Jesus. The rejection of this doctrine against the Trinity, the Holy Spirit is rejected or not recognized at all. Also an emphasis on this teaching of Unitarianism is human freedom and the goodness of God. In this teaching, the similarity with other teachings is that the Bible is used as the authority of human life. The christology held by the teachings of Unitarianism is arguably a powerful Monotheism. This doctrine acknowledges the existence of God, but for Christ it is not recognized as God. For followers of Unitarianism, Jesus was just a great man, a prophet of God or could also be called a miraculous man capable of performing miracles. Arianism is one of the schools that resembles Unitarianism.

Among them was one of the Unitarian figures, Arius, who was later convicted of heresy and was excommunicated by the church at that time until he died. The conflict between Unitarians and Trinitarians was the first major doctrinal confrontation in the Church after Christianity was legalized by Emperor Constantine I. Controversy over Trinitarians lasted from the 4th century and involved most church members, simple believers and monks, as well as bishops and emperors. While the Unitarians who were followers of Arius indeed for decades dominated among the Emperor's family, the nobility of the Empire and the higher clergy of his position, it was ultimately Trinitarianism that prevailed theologically and politically in the late 4th century and has since become a practically unchallenged doctrine in all the major branches of the Eastern and Western Churches. The Unitarian teachings taught by the Arian missionary Ulfilas to the Germanic tribes did persist for several centuries among a number of Germanic tribes in western Europe, particularly the Goths and Longobard tribes, but a little later did not play an important theological role anymore. Unitarians adhere to monotheism so strictly, and maintain that Jesus was a Prophet and Apostle of God who had a wide variety of mu'jizat and was glorified by God. but they strongly reject the view that Jesus is God Himself and Jesus is Lord as is the Trinitarian view. there is no particular authority regarding Unitarian beliefs other than Trinitarian denial.

To implement family planning programs in the community, various approaches are developed that are tailored to the needs of the program and the situation and conditions of the community. In the Pelita I Period, the Clinical Approach was developed because at the beginning of the program, the challenges to the idea of family planning (KB) were still very strong, for this reason, the approach through health was the most appropriate. The position of BKKBN in Presidential Decree No. 38 of 1978 is as a non-departmental government agency that is under and responsible to the President. Its main task is to prepare general policy and coordinate the implementation of the national and population planning programs that support it, both at the central and regional levels and coordinate the implementation in the field.

The authors of this book of pseudopigrapha usually use the name of a famous person to be the name of the author of the book or letter they made. The authors of the pseudographic books used pseudonyms or aliases. This pseudopicgrapha was written by a group of Jews. These pseudopicgraphic writings are very important because they shed light on the Jewish background of the Greek and Roman times. These pseudopicgraphical writings appeared in the years 250 BC to 200 AD. The word 'pseudopigrafa' comes from the Greek word \u03c8\u03b5\u03c5\u03b4\u03b5\u03c0\u03af\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03a6\u03bf\u03c2 (pseudepigraphos) and was first used by Serapion of Antioch, a Christian writer in the early second century.

The identification of experts later found that many of the writings entered the canon, both Jewish and Christian canons, and the apocryphal writings were unknown to the author. One example of such a book is the book of Daniel. Books that are classified as apocryphae can also be pseudographic books. Nevertheless, in general, pseudopigrapha refers to writings from the second century BC to the second century AD that do not enter the canon. The works of pseudopigrapha come from two groups, namely the Palestinian group and the Jewish-Hellenistic group. It is very important to know these two groups because the pseudopigarafa works that emerged from these two groups influenced the purpose and form of the work itself.

Not all writings use pseudonyms but there are many writings that use pseudonyms. Writings using this pseudonym are also widely found between canons and apocrypha. This is also shown by the large amount of content of pseudographic works relating to the Bible. Regarding the use of the meaning of the term there is still a lot of debate among experts. One of the characters who disagrees is Torrey. In one of his writings, Torrey chose to use apocryphae in the opening part of his writings. Torrey disagrees with the use of the term pseudographa in extracanonical books. another figure who also rejected that was R.H.Pfeiffer. There have been several objections raised relating to the use of the term pseudographa, one of which relates to writings derived from Qumran. some of the writings that appear in Qumran cannot be accurately classified as pseudographic.

In the next layer there is a tunica media composed of smooth muscles, collagen fibers and elastic tissue. The deepest layer is the tunica intima which is composed of endothelial cells and a collagen layer rich in elastin in the elastic arteries. Blood flows in a cavity called the lumen. There are several types of veins in the body: These vessels carry deoxygenated blood that has just flowed from the heart to the lungs. Systemic arteries carry blood towards arterioles and then to capillary vessels, where nutrients and gases are exchanged. The aorta is the largest vein in the body that comes out of the ventricles of the heart and carries a lot of oxygen. Arterioles are the smallest veins associated with capillary vessels.

Kermanshah is the largest Kurdish-speaking city in Iran. Most of the population of Kermanshah is Shi'a Muslim, but there are minorities such as Sunni Muslims, Yarsanism and so on. Due to its antiquity, interesting landscapes, rich culture and its Neolithic villages, Kermanshah is considered one of the birthplaces of prehistoric culture. According to archaeological surveys and excavations, the Kermanshah area has been occupied by prehistoric peoples since the Lower Paleolithic period, and continued into the later Paleolithic period until the late Pleistocene period. Evidence of the Lower Paleolithic period consists of several hand axes found in the Cakia area, east of the city. Relics of the Middle Paleolithic period are found around the north of the city at Tang-e Kenesht and near Taqwasan. Neanderthal humans existed in the Kermanshah region during this period. The known Paleolithic caves in this area are Warwasi, Qobeh, Malaverd, and Do-Ashkaft Caves. The region was also one of the first places where human settlements were located, among them were in Asiab, Qazanchi, Tappeh Sarab, Chia Jani, and Ganj-Darreh which were founded between 8,000-10,000 years ago.

Verona is the second largest municipality in Veneto and the third largest in Northeastern Italy. The Verona metropolitan area covers an area of 1,426 km2 (0.55 sq mi) and has a population of 714,274 inhabitants. The region is one of northern Italy's premier tourist destinations thanks to its artistic heritage, a number of annual exhibitions, performances and operas, such as a large-scale summer opera performance at the Arena Verona, an ancient amphitheatre built by the Romans. Three of Shakespeare's plays use Verona as the setting: Romeo and Juliet, The Two Gentlemen of Verona, and The Taming of the Shrew. The city was granted World Heritage Site status by UNESCO due to its architecture and urban structure. The etymology of the name \"Verona\" is unknown. The word is likely derived from Vera, possibly the name of an Etruscan; or it may also have come from Gaul. The word could have been the name of a Roman family or derived from the Latin word \"ver\", meaning \"spring\". However, according to one of the legends, a Gallic chieftain named Brenno as the legendary founder of the city called this new residential center \"Vae Roma\", that is, \"The Cursed Rome\", which centuries later turned into Verona. Another theory associates the origin of the name of this city with its river. \"Vera\" was a name for the Adige River before adopting its present name.citation needed] As in many similar cases in Europe, the name of the city was formed with the addition of the suffix -ona meaning the settlement above.

Verona became a Roman colonia in 89 BC, and then a municipium in 49 BC when its citizens were attributed to the Roman tribe Poblilia or Publicia. The city became important because it was at the intersection of several streets. Here Stilicho defeated Alaric, and the Visigothic tribe he led, in 403. But, after Verona was conquered by the Ostrogoths in 489, the dominance of the Goths in Italy began. Theoderic the Great is said to have built a palace here. The town remained under Gothic rule throughout the Gothic Wars of 535\u2013552, except for one day in 541 when a Byzantine officer named Artabazes entered the city. The defections that occurred among the Byzantine generals due to loot caused the Goths to regain control of the city. In 552, Valerian failed in his attempt to enter this city, but then they were completely defeated so that the Goths gave up this city. In 569, the city was captured by Alboin, King of the Lombards, in whose kingdom the city was in a sense the second most important city. In 572, Alboin was killed by his own wife in this city. The dukes of Treviso often lived here. In Verona, Adalgisus, son of Desiderius, in 774 gave his last desperate resistance to Charlemagne, who had destroyed the Lombard kingdom.

It is a type of sudden programmed cell death, driven by pathological stimuli such as microbial infections, cancer, strokes and heart attacks. Pyroptosis is a recently identified host cell death pathway stimulated by various microbial infections (e.g., Salmonella, Francisella, and Legionella) and non-infectious stimuli. It has been identified recently and is distinguished from apoptosis and necroptosis due to its differences in mechanism, characteristics, and outcomes, and can be classified as programmed necrosis due to its exclusive dependence on caspase-1. Caspase-1 is the main enzyme that recognizes mortality factors and activates inflammatory cytokines that cause plasma membranes to suddenly rupture and release proinflammatory contents that cause sudden cell death. Pyroptosis promotes the rapid clearance of various bacterial and viral infections by eliminating intracellular application niches and by enhancing the body's defense response. Cells can use a variety of intracellular and extracellular mechanisms to detect various \"danger\" signals generated or released during infection or injury. These detection mechanisms typically involve pattern recognition receptors (PRR) such as Toll receptors (TLR), NOD (NLR), RIG-I (RLR), and none of the melanoma 2 (AIM2) like receptors (ALRs), to name a few. PRR begins a signaling cascade that leads to the activation and production of inflammatory cytokines after recognizing a preserved microbial signature or hazard signal (commonly referred to as pathogen-related molecular patterns or PAMP, or hazard-related molecular hazards or DAMPS, respectively). The introduction of PAMPs, DAMPs, and some foreign toxins can lead to the activation of inflamasomes, which provoke the activation of caspase-1, and the initiation of pyroptosis.

The term is also used to refer to changes to the software/hardware to make it usable in different environments. Software is portable when the cost of moving it to a new platform is significantly cheaper than the cost of writing it from scratch. The lower the cost of software mapping relative to its implementation cost, it is said to be more mobile. The term \"port\" comes from the Latin port\u0101re, meaning \"to carry\". When the code is incompatible with a particular operating system or architecture, it must be \"brought\" to the new system. The term is generally not applied to the process of allowing software to run with less memory on the same CPU and operating system, nor is it applied to rewriting source code in different languages (i.e. language conversion or translation). Software developers often claim that the software they write is mobile, that is, it takes little effort to adapt it to the new environment. The amount of effort that is actually required depends on several factors, including the extent to which the original environment (source platform) differs from the new environment (target platform), the original author's experience in knowing which programming language constructions and third-party library calls are not mobile, and the amount of effort invested by the original author using only mobile constructions (platform-specific constructions often provide a more resolution  cheap). The number of CPUs and operating systems used on desktops today is much smaller than before. The dominance of the x86 architecture means that most desktop software is never ported to a different CPU.

However, in the embedded systems and mobile markets, portability remains a significant issue, with ARM being a widely used alternative. Foreign standards, such as those set by ISO, greatly facilitate the standardization by determining the details of the computing environment in a way that helps reduce differences between the various standards-compliant platforms. Writing software that stays within the boundaries defined by this standard is a practical though not trivial endeavor. Such a system between two standards-compliant platforms (such as POSIX.1) is only a matter of loading the source code and compiling it again in the new platform. However, practitioners often find that various small corrections are necessary, due to subtle differences in the platform. Most standards experience \"gray areas\" or uncertainties where differences in interpretation of the standard cause small variations from platform to platform. There are also an ever-increasing number of tools to facilitate coordination, such as GNU Compiler Collection, which provides a consistent programming language across multiple platforms, and Autotools, which automates the detection of small variations in the environment and adjusts the software accordingly before compilation. Compilers for some high-level programming languages (e.g., Eiffel, Esterel) gain portability by issuing source code in other high-level intermediate languages (such as C) where compilers for many platforms are generally available. Two activities associated with (but different from) pemortaan are emulation and cross-compilation. Instead of translating directly to machine code, modern compilers translate to independent machine intermediate code to improve compiler portability and minimize design effort.

Mount Muria at the end of the Ice Age (about 10,000 years BC) was a separate island from Java, which eventually coalesced due to alluvial deposits from flowing rivers. The city of Demak during the Sultanate of Demak (16th century AD) was by the sea and became the berth of ships. This sedimentation process is still ongoing on the coast of Semarang.

In economics, a business is an organization that sells goods or services to consumers or other businesses, in order to make a profit. Historically, the word business is from the English business, from the root word busy which means \"busy\" in the context of an individual, community, or society. In a sense, busy doing activities and work that bring profit. In a capitalist economy, where most businesses are owned by private parties, businesses are formed to make a profit and increase the prosperity of their owners. The owners and operators of a business get rewards according to the time, effort, or capital they give. However, not all businesses pursue this kind of profit, for example cooperative businesses aimed at improving the welfare of all their members or government institutions aimed at improving the welfare of the people. Such a business model contrasts with the socialistic system, where big business is mostly owned by the government, the general public, or trade unions. Etymologically, business means the state in which a person or group of people is busy doing work that generates profit. The word \"business\" itself has three uses, depending on the scope \u2014 the singular use of the word business can refer to a business entity, that is, a juridical (legal), technical, and economic unity aimed at making a profit or profit. Broader usage may refer to a specific market sector, for example the \"television business.\" The most widespread use refers to all activities carried out by the community of providers of goods and services. But the exact definition of \"business\" is still the subject of debate today. Although the form of business ownership varies by country, there are several forms that are considered common: A sole proprietorship is a business whose ownership is held by one person.

Arius rejected the doctrine of Christ's divinity with the view that Christ was only a creation of God and not God. This view of his later influenced the emergence of a movement called Arianism. Arius's thoughts on the divinity of Christ were later rejected at the Council of Nicea and he was excommunicated from the church. Arius was born in Alexandria in 250, during the reign of Emperor Decius. He received his theological education from Lucian, a theologian from Antioch. After Lucian died in 306, Arius returned to Alexandria and settled there. In Alexandria, Arius was appointed deacon by Bishop Peter of Alexandria. Bishop Peter himself was at odds with Meletius of Lycopolis, over the rejection of apostate Christians during a time of torture by the Roman empire. However, Arius was on Meletius' side, so he was excommunicated from the church by Peter. In 311, Peter was succeeded by Achillas, who later restored the post of deacon Arius, even appointing him presbytery. Akhillas died in 312 and was succeeded by Alexander. In 318 there was tension between Arius and Alexander, when Arius developed his theology typical of the Antiochian tradition. Arius's later thought that gave rise to debate and contention with Alexander was about the divinity of Christ. In line with Origenes' thinking, he believed that God the Father was greater than the Son or Christ and also later greater than the Holy Spirit. However, he incorporated the concept of monotheism into his understanding of God by concluding that only God the Father is God, while Christ or the Son is only God's firstborn and supreme created being of God the Father, but not God.

These points of understanding of Arius are found in his book entitled Thallia. Alexander did not approve of this view of Arius. According to Alexander, the Father is eternal, but there was never without the Son, so the Son is also eternal. The Son was not created by God out of nothing, but He was already with God and homoousiose with God. According to Alexander the Son must be truly God in order to save man. In 318 Alexander convened a synod in Alexandria which decided to have Arius condemned. Alexander condemned the teachings of Arius. Arius was also condemned along with five presbyters and six other deacons. However, Arius also has many supporters. He then turned to Eusebius of Nicomedia for help. Eusebius was in a strong position to support Arius, and this ignited a major split. This commotion divided the two churches in Alexandria into the camp of Arius and the camp of Alexander. Debates and disputes in Alexandria then unsettled Emperor Constantine. He felt that divisions within the church could disrupt the security and stability of the country. However, Constantine did not immediately take the decision to judge unilaterally. He chose to call the bishops to find a way to resolve this dispute. Later in 325, Constantine summoned bishops from various parts of the Roman empire to gather at a council in the City of Nicea (now Iznik in Turkey). The council opened with a discussion of the issue of Arius' views. Eusebius of Nicomedia presided over several bishops who supported Arius. But when Arius read out his views on the divinity of Christ and other views, many bishops later withdrew their support from Arius for viewing his writings as blasphemy.

It is the third member in the lanthanide series and is considered one of the rare earth metals. It is a soft, silvery, malleable and ductile metal, valuable for its magnetic, electrical, chemical and optical properties. It is too reactive to be found in its original form, and pure praseodymium metal slowly develops a layer of green oxide when exposed to air. Praseodymium always occurs naturally along with other rare earth metals. It is the sixth most abundant rare earth element and the fourth most abundant lanthanide, making up 9.1 parts per million of the earth's crust, an abundance similar to boron. In 1841, the Swedish chemist Carl Gustav Mosander extracted a residue of rare earth oxide that he called didymium from a residue he called \"lanthana\", which in turn was separated from the serium salt. In 1885, the Austrian chemist Baron Carl Auer von Welsbach separated dymmymium into two elements that produce salts of different colors, which he named praseodymium and neodymium. The name praseodymium comes from the Ancient Greek \u03c0\u03c1\u03ac\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 (prasinos), meaning 'green prei', and \u03b4\u03af\u03b4\u03c5\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 (didymos) 'twin'. Like most rare earth elements, praseodymium most easily forms an oxidation state of +3, which is the only stable state in aqueous solutions, although an oxidation state of +4 is known in some solid compounds and, uniquely among lanthanides, an oxidation state of +5 can be achieved under matrix isolation conditions. Oxidation states of 0, +1, and +2 are rare. Aqueous praseodymium ions are yellowish-green, and similarly, praseodymium produces a variety of yellow-green colors when introduced into glass. Many uses of praseodymium in industry involve its ability to filter yellow light from light sources. ", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "Praseodymium is the third member of the lanthanide series, and is also a member of rare earth metals. In the periodic table, it appears among other lanthanides, namely on the left of the cerium and on the right of the neodymium, as well as above the actinide protactinium. It is a ductile metal with a hardness comparable to silver. Its 59 electrons are arranged in the Xe]4f36s2 configuration; Theoretically, the five outer electrons can act as valence electrons, but the use of all five electrons requires extreme conditions and usually, praseodymium only releases three or sometimes four electrons in its compounds. Like most other metals in the lanthanide series, praseodymium usually uses only three electrons as valence electrons, since after that the remaining 4f electrons are bound too strongly: this is because the 4f orbitals at most penetrate the xenon nucleus that extends from the electrons into their nuclei, followed by 5d and 6s, and this increases with a higher ion charge. Nevertheless, praseodymium can continue to lose fourth and even sometimes fifth valence electrons because it comes very early in the lanthanide series, where the charge of the nucleus is still low enough and the energy of the 4f subshell is high enough to allow for further release of valence electrons. So, similar to other early trivalent lanthanides, praseodymium has a crystal structure of a double hexagonal solid arrangement at room temperature. At about 560 \u00b0C, it transitions into a face-centered cube structure, and the body-centered cube structure appears shortly before its melting point, 935 \u00b0C.  Praseodymium, like all other lanthanides (except lanthanum, iterbium, and lutezium, which do not have unpaired 4f electrons), is paramagnetic at room temperature. Unlike some other rare earth metals, which exhibit antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic at low temperatures, praseodymium is paramagnetic at all temperatures above 1 K. Praseodymium has only one stable and natural isotope, 141Pr.

In the field of insurance, risk can be interpreted as a state of uncertainty, where in the event of an undesirable circumstance, it can cause a loss. Forms of risk include pure risk, speculative risk, particular risk and fundamental risk. As an organization, companies generally have a goal in implementing risk management. The goals to be achieved include reducing expenses, preventing the company from failing, increasing company profits, reducing production costs and so on. Risk management is a risk management process that includes identifying, evaluating and controlling risks that can threaten the continuity of a company's business or activities. The stages passed by the company in implementing risk management are to identify in advance the risks that may be experienced by the company, after identifying the evaluation of each risk in terms of severity (risk value) and frequency. The final stage is risk control. In the risk control stage, it is divided into 2, namely physical control (risk eliminated, risk minimized) and financial control (risk held, risk transferred). Eliminating risk means eliminating all possible losses, for example in driving a car in the rainy season, the vehicle speed is limited to a maximum of 60 km / h. Minimizing risks is carried out with efforts to minimize losses, for example in production, the chances of a failed product can be reduced by quality control. Withholding risks means bearing all or part of the risk, for example by forming a reserve within the company to deal with impending losses (self-retention).

This quality can be seen from how a conflict or problem can be presented as a whole and deeply in a staging of a play. The term for drama during the Dutch colonial period in Indonesia is called tonil. Tonil then developed to be replaced with the term play by P.K.G Mangkunegara VII.

Drama is a work that contains high artistic value. A play follows an organized plot structure. An organized structure will help the audience enjoy a staged drama. The structure of the play contains acts, scenes, dialogues, prologues and epilogues. Act is another term for episode. Each act contains one whole small story that becomes the whole drama. In other words, an act is part of a play's script that summarizes an event that occurs somewhere in a certain time order. The scene is part of the play that shows the changes in events.

The Kaharingan religion has existed for a long time in Kalimantan even before other religions entered Kalimantan. Currently, Kaharingan is one of the ancestral religions in Indonesia that still survives and is still embraced by some Dayak tribes, especially in Central and South Kalimantan. Kaharingan means to grow or live, as in the term danum kaharingan (water of life). Kaharingan believers believe in God Almighty (Ranying Hatalla Langit), embraced for generations and lived by the Dayak community in Kalimantan. The Kaharingan religion has its own symbol, namely the Crisp Trunk symbol which means the tree of life. The Batang Garing symbol is familiar to the Dayak community because it is often found in many buildings in Central Kalimantan. As a result of the Indonesian government requiring residents and citizens to adhere to one of the religions recognized by the government of the Republic of Indonesia, since April 20, 1980 the Kaharingan religion has finally been categorized as one of the branches in Hinduism (its designation becomes Kaharingan Hinduism).

In 1945, the Japanese occupation proposed Kaharingan as a mention of the Dayak religion, but the proposal was rejected by the Indonesian government on the grounds that the Kaharingan religion had not spread throughout the Indonesian regions/archipelago.

The Traditional Aruh Ceremony aims to express gratitude to the Almighty for bestowing a bountiful rice harvest, and at the same time respect for the spirits of the ancestors who are believed to have always protected them from catastrophe. In East Malaysia (Sarawak and Sabah), the Kaharingan religion is not recognized as part of Hinduism, so it is considered a society that has not adhered to any religion. Now most Dayak tribes in Malaysia are Christians, as are the Dayak tribes in West Kalimantan, where this happened along with the rampant spread of Protestant Christianity in Kalimantan which began in the 1830s.

When Myrmidon led by Achilles turned the tide of battle and Hektor was killed, predicting the imminent Trojans, Helenos - like most of the greatest heroes - survived the poem. In the last year of the Trojan War, Helenos competed against his brother Deiphobos to remove Helene from the Trojans after their brother's death in Paris but Helene was given to Deiphobos.

Derma can be in the form of goods or services (e.g. education) that are given free of charge without coercion. Bederma is taught by a number of religions and customs. The word \"derma\" in Indonesian comes from the Sanskrit word \u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e, dharma, which means propriety, benevolence, righteous practice, or pious charity. Another term for charity is \"almsgiving\", from the Arabic word \u0635\u062f\u0642\u0629, \u1e63adaqah, which means all sorts of good deeds towards others that are done sincerely. In Jewish religion, tzedakah (Hebrew: \u05e6\u05d3\u05e7\u05d4, \u1e63edakah, literally meaning truth, but commonly interpreted as generosity) refers to the obligation of adherents of the Jewish religion to act righteously and justly. The giving of tzedakah is now regarded as a continuation of the practice of ma'ser ani or the allowance of one-tenth of the produce for the poor, as well as other philanthropic practices mandated in the Bible, such as allowing the poor to reap the produce that grows in the corners of the fields, and letting anyone enjoy the produce grown during the Smitah (sabbath year). Tzedakah, accompanied by prayer and repentance, is considered an antidote to the rewards of bad deeds. In the Jewish religion, tzedakah (generosity) is seen as one of the noblest deeds that can be done by man. Jewish farmers were prohibited from harvesting produce grown in the corners of their fields or picking up fallen crops, so that they could be used by the poor. The great Jewish clergyman, Moses the son of Maimun, once compiled a list of acts of generosity. According to Moses bin Maimun, the most correct act of generosity is to enable the recipient to become an independent person so that he is able to act generously towards others.

There are various rules related to the implementation of zakat, but in general, people are required to hand over 2.5% of their deposits and business income, as well as 5\u201310% of their harvest to the poor. Zakat recipients include people who have almost nothing, people who have very low incomes, people who can't afford to pay debts, people who run out of funds on the way, and other parties who need help. The general principle of zakat is zakaah, that is, the rich must give to the poor. One of the important principles in Islam is the teaching that everything belongs to Allah, so wealth can only be stored as a entrustment to manage. The literal meaning of the word zakat is \"purify\", \"develop\", and \"trigger growth\". According to Islamic law, zakat is worship. A Muslim's wealth is purified through the act of separating part of it from that wealth for those who need it, just as plants are pruned to rejuvenate it and stimulate the growth of new shoots. Zakat is an amount of money that must be handed over by every adult Muslim, male or female, who is sane (spiritually healthy), independent, and financially capable, to be used as a relief fund for certain parties.

The semipermeable membrane must be passable by the solvent, but not by the solute, resulting in a pressure gradient along the membrane. Osmosis is a natural phenomenon, but it can be artificially inhibited by increasing the pressure on the part with a concentrated concentration to exceed the part with a more liquid concentration. The force per unit area required to prevent the solvent from flowing through the selective permeable membrane and into the solution with a more concentrated concentration proportional to the turgor pressure. Osmotic pressure is a colligative property, which means that this property depends on the concentration of the solute, and not on the nature of the solute itself. Osmosis is an important topic in biology because this phenomenon can explain why water can be transported into and out of cells. The process of occurrence of osmosis, through computer simulation The effect of different solutions on blood cells Plant cells in several different environments Factors affecting Osmosis: 1. Size of pervasive molecules: Molecules smaller than the central line of the membrane hole will permeate more easily. 2. Lipid solubility: Molecules that have high solubility permeate faster than molecules with low solubility such as lipids. 3. Membrane surface area: The infiltration rate becomes faster if the surface area of the membrane provided for infiltration is larger. 4. Membrane thickness: The infiltration rate of a molecule is of a magnitude with the distance it must travel. Compared to one thick membrane, the infiltration rate through one thin membrane is faster.

The infiltration rate will become faster at high temperatures compared to low temperatures. Osmosis is the diffusion of water across the semipermeable membrane from an area where more water is abundant to an area with less water . Osmosis is largely determined by the chemical potential of water or the potential of water, which describes the ability of water molecules to be able to perform diffusion. A large amount of water volume will have an excess of free energy over a meager volume, under the same conditions. The free energy of one substance per unit amount, especially per gram weight of molecules (mol-1 free energy) is called the chemical potential. The chemical potential of a solute is more or less proportional to the concentration of the solute. Diffusion solutes tend to move from regions with higher chemical potential towards regions with smaller chemical potentials (Ismail, 2006). In the body of a multicellular organism, water moves from one cell to another freely due to the presence of osmosis events. In addition to water, small molecules such as O2 and CO2 also easily pass through cell membranes. The molecules will diffuse from areas with high concentrations to low concentrations. The Osmosis process will stop if the concentration of substances on both sides of the membrane has reached equilibrium(Anonim, 2009). The structure of the cell wall and the cell membrane is different. The membrane allows water molecules to pass faster than dissolved elements; The primary cell wall is usually very permeable to both. Indeed, plant cell membranes allow osmosis to take place, but it is the turgid cell walls that cause pressure. Animal cells do not have walls, so when pressure arises in them, they often break, as happens when red blood cells are put in water.

It is located to the North-West of Damascus, in the Anti-Lebanon area, on the banks of Abana (mod Barada), approximately 29 km northwest of Damascus (the rubble is scattered around the village of Es-Suk). Its territorial boundary cannot be precisely defined, but it appears to have been included on the eastern slopes of the Anti-Lebanese mountains, and has been extended to the south and southeast of Damascus as far as the borders of Galilee, Batanaea, and Trachonitis. According to Flavius Josephus, Abilene was a separate kingdom of Iturea until 37 AD. Abilene included the Iturean kingdom of Ptolemy Mennaeus (\u00c2\u00a6 85-40 BC) and his son Lysanias (40-36 BC); then the area was separated into a special territory of the eldest king Lysanias according to Luke 3:1. An inscription in Abilene from the period between 15-30 BC refers to 'Lisanias king of the region'. In 37 BC the territory was granted by Emperor Gaius to Herod Agrippa I to be part of his kingdom, and in 53 it was given again by Claud to Herod Agrippa II. Abilene, when first mentioned in history, was ruled by Ptolemaeus (85-50 BC, son of Mennaeus, who was succeeded, around 40 BC, by a son named Lisanias. Lysanias was put to death in 36 BC, at the instigation of Cleopatra, and the kingdom moved, apparently through some kind of purchase, into the hands of a man named Zenodorus, from whom it was transferred (31 BC) to Herod the Great. On Herod's death (4 BC) one part was annexed to his son Philip's tetrarkhi, and the rest was given to Lysaniah mentioned by Luke (Luke 3:1). Soon after the death of Tiberius (37 AD), Caligula gave to Herod Agrippa, at that time a prisoner in Rome, the territories of the tetrarkhi Philip and the tetrarkhi Lisanias, while Claudius, having ascended the throne (41), not only confirmed the mercy of his predecessor towards Herod Agrippa, but added all the parts of Judea and Samaria that his grandfather Herod, once had, together (according to Josephus) with Abila,  which was once given to Lisanias, and the adjoining regions of Lebanon.

Abila is mentioned among the places captured by Placidus, one of the generals of Vespasian in AD 69 or 70 (Joseph. B. J. iv. 7. \u00a7 5), and has since been permanently annexed to the provinces of Syria.

This element is highly radioactive; its most stable isotope, francium-223 (originally called actinium-K), has a half-life of only 22 minutes. This element is the second lowest electronegative element after cesium and the second rarest element that exists in nature after astatine. Isotopes from francium very quickly decay into astatine, radium, and radon. As an alkali metal, this element has one valence electron. Francium in chunk form has never been seen. When viewed from the general characteristics of other elements that are columnar in the periodic table, it is assumed that francium is a highly reactive metal. Getting the sample is almost impossible, since the extreme heat of decay (the longest half-life of the isotope is only 22 minutes) will immediately evaporate whenever there is a certain amount of elements that can be seen. Francium was discovered by Marguerite Perey in France (which later became the name of this element) in 1939. This element was the last element first discovered in nature, not synthesized.a] Outside the laboratory, francium is extremely rare, with small amounts found in uranium and thorium ores, where the isotope francium-223 continues to form and decay. This element is present in the earth's crust as much as 20-30 g at all times, the other isotopes (except francium-221) are synthetic. The largest number produced in the laboratory is 300, 000 atoms.

Francium liquid- if made\u2014must have a surface tension of 0.05092 N/m at its boiling point. The melting point of francium is calculated to be about 27 \u00b0C (80 \u00b0F, 300 K). This melting point is uncertain due to the rarity of this element and its radioactive nature. Thus, the estimated boiling point value of 677 \u00b0C (1250 \u00b0F, 950 K) is also uncertain. Linus Pauling estimated the electronegativity of francium to be 0.7 on the Pauling scale, the same as cesium; The value for cesium has been refined to 0.79, but there is no experimental data that allows improving the value for francium. Francium has a slightly higher ionization energy than cesium, 392.811(4) kJ/mol (cesium 375.7041(2) kJ/mol). Francium also has a higher electron affinity than cesium and Fr\u2212 ions should be more polarized than Cs\u2212 ions. There are 34 known isotopes of francium ranging from atomic masses 199 to 232. Francium has seven metastable nuclear isomers. Francium-223 and francium-221 are the only isotopes that appear in nature. Francium-223 is the most stable isotope with a half-life of 21.8 minutes, and to date it is not expected that it will be possible to find an isotope of francium with a longer half-life. Francium-223 is the fifth product of the actinium decay series as a tiller isotope of actinium-227.

This is necessary because towards the end of the century leading up to the advent of Christianity, the common language was undergoing a transition, i.e. Hebrew which was the original language of the Hebrew Bible was no longer used in general and only in the context of religious events. Eventually it became imperative to give explanations and translations into the vernacular, after the reading of part of the Tanakh. The noun \"Targum\" is derived from the early semitic quadriliteral root word \"trgm\", and the term \"Targummanu\" which refers to \"translator.\" The root of the word appears in the Hebrew Bible in the Book of Ezra, which is Ezra 4:18, \"the letter you sent us, has been read to me clearly.\" (the word \"clearly\" in Aramaic: mepares, which means \"(with) translated\"). In addition to providing translations of the Bible, the term \"Targum\" is also used for interpretation or oral preaching of the Bible in synagogues, while bible translators are simply called hammeturgems (\"he who translates\"). In addition to meaning \"to translate\", the verb \"Tirgem\" also means \"to explain\". So the word \"Targum\" refers to \"translation along with argumentation or explanation\". The writing of \"targum\" was once banned, but a number of targum-based writings have appeared as early as the mid-1st century AD. However, these writings were not recognized as authoritative by the religious leaders of the era. Some Jewish traditions (beginning with Babylonian Jews) accepted the written \"targumim\" as authoritative, and are still the subject of debate today. Now, only Jews from the Yemeni state continue to wear \"targumim\" in liturgy.

Yemeni Jews are the only Jewish community that continues to use the Targum as a liturgical text, as well as preserving the living tradition of Aramaic pronunciation of targumim (according to a Babylonian dialect). The Talmud expressly states that it is not permissible to compose an official targumim other than the above two relating to Torah and Nevi'im alone, so that there is no official targum for Ketuvim (\"Book of writings\"). The official targum was not necessary for Ketuvim because his books did not play a permanent role in the liturgy. However most of the books of Ketuvim (with the exception of the books of Daniel and Ezra-Nehemiah, both of which contain passages in Aramaic) have targumim, whose origin is mostly from the west (Land of Israel) not from the east (Babylonia). However, since they have no fixed place in the liturgy, they are not well preserved and are less well known. From the land of Israel, the targum tradition concerning Ketuvim reached Italy, and from there to the Ashkenazi and Sephardi groups in the middle ages.

In linguistics, pragmatics is one part of semiotics. The principles in pragmatics include the synthesis between study, intent and speech. Meanwhile, the aspects involved in pragmatics are language elements, language speakers and language estimators. Pragmatics examines contextual meanings or situational meanings based on the setting of the place, the setting of time, participants, the purpose of the topic and the medium of communication. References in the analysis of meaning to oral communication in pragmatics use the theory of speech acts. Pragmatic theory is used as a way to assess certain objectives in literary works containing values or teachings addressed to the reader. In addition, pragmatics also examines discourse. An early view of pragmatics was developed by Charles W. Morris in 1938. The foundation of pragmatic development used by Morris is semiotics. The science of semiotics is divided by Morris into semantics, syntax and pragmatics. Pragmatic science then developed in Europe during the period of the 1940s. In 1960, Michael Halliday developed a social theory that made language a social phenomenon. Furthermore, in the United States in 1962 a pragmatic understanding derived from the philosophical thought of J. L. Austin developed. Austin's work that influenced pragmatics in the United States was a book called How to Do Things with Words (1962). Austin's main thoughts are about performative and constative speech and the idea of locution, illocution, perlocution and illocutionary power of speech. Pragmatics in the United States was also influenced by Austin's student John Searle. He developed Austin's thoughts and published his works on pragmatics in 1969 and 1975.

In addition to Austin and Searle there are several other thinkers namely Paul Grice, John Rankine Goody, Stephen C. Levinson and Mey. The term pragmatics was first introduced by Charles W. Morris through the division of semiotics. Pragmatics has two meanings in both broad and narrow senses. Broadly speaking, pragmatics is defined as one of the parts of semiotics. This meaning was given by Morris. Pragmatics in this broad sense is used in various scientific papers related to language problems, including the psikpathology of communication and the evolution of the symbol system. While in a narrow sense, pragmatics is a research condition that has a real reference to a language user or speaker. This second meaning was given by Rudolf Carnap. The philosophy of ordinary language emerged as a contradiction over the view that language is formed through logical atomism and logical positivism that uses complex logic. His earliest thinker was Ludwig Wittgenstein. The emergence of philosophy of common language influenced philosophical thought in Europe. The study of the philosophy of ordinary language then prioritizes the pragmatic aspects of a language. The philosophy of ordinary language then examines the meaning of human life through language. Sociolinguistics examines language variation and language use in the social environment of a society. The sociolinguistic context has to do with pragmatics, since sociolinguistics examines elements outside of language. The relationship between socioloinguistics and pragmatics is twofold. First, pragmatics studies the aspects of context that determine the meaning of a utterance. Second, pragmatics studies the requirements that result in a congruence between the use of language in communication. Context is necessary in pragmatics for certain languages. This context relates to the social environment and physical environment which includes social status, level of education, age, economic level, and gender.

According to the consensus of experts, he died around 185 AD, likely in the (Roman) province of Assyria. He came to the city of Rome, and stayed for some time. It seems that this is where he first encountered Christianity. According to him, it was his devotion to pagan cultist practices that made him spend a lot of thought on religious issues. From the Old Testament, he was convinced of the inevitability of paganism. He converted to Christianity and became a student of Justin Martyr. In those days Christian philosophers were fighting against Greek philosophers known as \"sophists\". Like Justin, he opened a Christian school in Rome. It is not known how long he worked uninterruptedly in the city. After Justin's death in 165 AD, Tatian's life became less clear. Irenaeus records (Haer., I., xxvlii. 1, Ante-Nicene Fathers, i. 353) that after Justin's death, Tatian was expelled from the church because of the \"Encratician\" asceticism view (Eusebius wrote that Tatian founded the Encratic sect) and for being a follower of valentinius's school of gnosticism. To be clear, Tatian left Rome, probably staying temporarily in Greece or Alexandria in Egypt, where he taught Clement of Alexandria.

The ascetic character of Syrian Christians born in the time of Aphraates is not emphasized by Tatian, but has much deeper roots. The early development of the Syrian church resulted in a commentary on Tatian's attitude in practical life, among other things for the requirement of Aphraates baptism in which the vow of the person to be baptized (catechumen) was taken to live celibacy (unmarried). This shows the solidity of Tatian's view in Syria, and supports the news that Tatian is a missionary to the countries around the Euphrates sungat. His work Oratio ad Graecos (\"Speech to the Greeks\") denounced paganism as worthless, and praised the resourcefulness and antiquity of Christianity. In times as early as Eusebius, Tatian was praised for his discussions of Moses' antiquity and Jewish legislation, and for this part of chronology, this Oratio was generally not reproached. Another major work is Diatessaron, a \"harmony\" or synthesis of the four Gospels in the New Testament into one narrative combination of the life of Jesus. Eprem of Syria refers to it as the Evangelion da Mehallete (\"Mixed Gospel\"), and in practice the only gospel manuscript used in Syria during the 3rd and 4th centuries AD. In the 5th century the Diatessaron was replaced with the original use of the four Gospels in Syrian churches. Rabbula, bishop of Edessa, Mesopotamia, ordered priests and deacons to check that each church had a copy of the \"separate gospels\" (Evangelion da Mepharreshe), and Theodoret, bishop of Cyrus, removed more than 200 copies of Diatessaron from churches in his diocese. A number of Diatessaron derivatives (recensions) are also available. The oldest, as a derivative of the Eastern family of recensions, is preserved in Ephraiim's commentary on Tatian's work, and this Commentary is also preserved in two versions: an Armenian translation preserved in two copies, as well as a copy of Ephraem's original manuscript in Syriac from the late 5th/early 6th century AD, edited by Louis Lelow (Paris,  1966).

The petarak (practitioners of asceticism) may have separated themselves from the crowds of the world in order to be ascetic, and could also live in the midst of society, but they usually adopted a very unpretentious lifestyle, characterized by a rejection of physical possessions and pleasures, and passing time by fasting while diligently worshipping or while pondering spiritual matters. Asceticism is divided into two kinds. \"Natural asceticism\" is a lifestyle that limits the material aspects of everyday life to a very earthy level and to a certain minimum extent but without damaging the body or living in a state of earnestness that afflicts the body, while \"unnatural asceticism\" (unnatural asceticism) is a practice that also involves the act of physical violence (physical mortification) and self-harm,  For example, by sleeping on a nail bed. Throughout history, asceticism has been practiced in a variety of religions, including Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Jainaism, and Jewish religion. Asceticism is not practiced in the main sects of Islam, except by the minority sect of Sufis with its old tradition which also includes strict rules. Asceticism practitioners in these religions deliberately deny worldly pleasures and lead a lifestyle of abstinence, in pursuit of penance, salvation, or spiritual attainment. In ancient theologies, asceticism was seen as a journey towards spiritual transformation, that is, a state in which earthiness is well-off, true happiness resides within, and lack is abundance The adjective \"ascetic\" comes from the ancient Greek term, ask\u0113sis, which means exercise or exercise.

The term was later used also as a designation for the severe practices in all major religions that were carried out in different weights in order to obtain penance and spiritual glory. Asceticism is classified into a form of natural asceticism and a form of unnatural asceticism. \"Natural asceticism\" is defined as a lifestyle that limits the material aspects of everyday life to a very earthy and limited degree. This form of asceticism includes actions such as dressing modestly and limitedly, sleeping on the floor of a house or in a cave, and eating a limited number of simple dishes. Natural asceticism, according to Wimbush and Valantasis, does not include actions that damage the body or live in a state of deprivation that it afflicts the body. In contrast, \"unnatural asceticism\" is defined as a much more onerous practice, and also includes the act of physical abuse, torturing one's own body, and the habit of self-harm such as sleeping on a nail bed. Disciplining oneself and abstaining in form and to some extent is part of religious practice in many religions and spiritual traditions. The ascetic lifestyle is particularly associated with monks, nuns, and fakirs in the Abrahamic religions, as well as the biku, muni, sanyasi, and yogis in the Indian religions. Christian poets from the late antiquities such as Origenes, Saint Heronimus, Saint Ignatius, John Christostomus, and Augustine interpreted the meaning of biblical verses in a very ascetic spiritual environment. Examples of asceticism in the Bible can be found in the biographies of John the Baptist, Jesus, the twelve apostles, and the Apostle Paul. The scrolls of the Dead Sea manuscripts reveal the practices of the ancient Jewish sect, Eseni, who vowed to live abstinence in preparation for holy war.

At first, patriarch was a term for a man who exercised autocratic authority as the pater familias (head of the family) over a large family. This system of family government led by men aged in the family is called patriarchy. In the course of history, a patriarch was commonly chosen to be the etnarka (head of the people) for the communities of his faith in the territory of a state or empire that housed a wide variety of religious communities (e.g. Christians within the Ottoman Empire). The term was later used as the title of Church leader. Ecclesiastical offices and territories headed by a patriarch are called patriarchates or patriarchates. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are referred to as the three patriarchs of the nation of Israel, and their lifetimes are referred to as the Age of Patriarch. The word \"patriarch\" was first given a religious meaning in the Septuagint Bible. In the Catholic Church, the bishop who heads an autonomous particular Church, called the sui iuris Church in canon law, is usually a patriarch. However, for a number of reasons, this responsibility may also be entrusted to a major archbishop, metropolit, or other clergyman. Since the Council of Nicaea, the Bishop of Rome has been recognized as primus inter pares among patriarchs. This Council established three bishops entitled to use this title 'above the metropolite', namely the Bishop of Rome, the Bishop of Alexandria, and the Bishop of Antioch.

The Bishop of Rome was also granted authority over the western region of North Africa. The sphere of authority of other patriarchs covers the entire Roman Asia and Africa for the rest. This order was officially accepted by the higher-ups of the Church in the Council of Trullo in 692, although it was rejected by the Throne of the Diocese of Rome. It should be noted that at that time there were also bishops who headed apostolic thrones with the equivalent authority of patriarchs outside the territory of the Roman Empire, for example Katolikos Selukia-Ktesifon. Today, the heads of autonomous Churches within the Catholic Church with batrik titles are: The four Eastern Catholic Churches are headed by clergy with the title of principal archbishop.

The second law of thermodynamics limits the amount of work gained through the heating process\u2014some of which will be lost as heat is wasted. The maximum amount that can be used for work is called available energy. Systems such as machines and living objects require available energy, not just any energy. Mechanical energy and other forms of energy can pass directly into the form of thermal energy without certain restrictions. There are various forms of energy, but all these types of energy must meet various conditions such as being able to be converted to other forms of energy, obeying the laws of energy conservation, and causing changes in mass objects that are subjected to such energy. Common forms of energy include kinetic energy from moving objects, radiant energy from light and electromagnetic radiation, potential energy stored in an object due to its position such as gravitational field, electric field or magnetic field, and thermal energy consisting of microscopic potential and kinetic energy from irregular particle movements. Some specific forms of potential energy are elastic energy caused by the elongation or deformation of solids and chemical energy such as the release of heat when the fuel burns. Any body that has mass when stationary, has a stationary mass or equal to stationary energy, although it is not described in everyday phenomena in classical physics.

For example, adding 25 kilowatt-hours (90 megajoules) of energy to an object increases its mass by 1 microgram; If there is such a sensitive scale then this mass gain can be seen. The sun converts nuclear potential energy into other forms of energy; Its total mass will change when energy is released around it mainly in the form of radiant energy. Although energy can change shape, the law of conservation of energy states that the total energy in a system only changes if energy moves in or out of the system. This means that it is impossible to create or destroy energy. The total energy of a system can be calculated by adding all forms of energy in the system. Examples of energy displacement and transformation are the generation of electricity, chemical reactions, or raising objects. Living organisms also need available energy to stay alive; Humans, for example, need energy from food along with oxygen to metabolize it. Civilization requires energy supply for various activities; Energy sources such as fossil fuels are an important topic in economics and politics.

Unlike other kentaurs who are fond of drunkenness, wildness, and unculturedness, Kheiron is precisely an intelligent, civilized, and kind kentaur. He is known for his knowledge and ability in medicine. Kheiron was the son of Kronos when Kronos was in the form of a horse This Kheiron genealogy is different from other kentaurs born from the sun and rain clouds. Kheiron was clever because he was taught by Apollo and Artemis when he was young. Kheiron was famous throughout Greek mythology because he educated the young Achilles. His skills are similar to those of his adoptive father, Apollo, who taught him as a young man the sciences of medicine, herbs, music, archery, hunting, gymnastics and divination, and made him change from his cruel nature. Kheiron is famous for his knowledge and skills in medicine, and is considered the inventor of botany and pharmacy, the science of vegetation and medicine. Like satire, centaurs are notorious for being wild, lustful, drinkers and drunks, cruel when drunk, and generally uncultured delinquents. Kheiron, on the other hand, was an intelligent, civilized, and kind centaur. It is influenced by its origin so it is never directly related to other centauruses. He is the son of Titan Kronos and Oceanid Philyra. He was probably brothers with Dolops and Aphrus, ancestors and eponyms of Aphroi, a native of Africa. Kheiron lives on Mount Pelion; there he married the nymph Khariklo who bore three daughters, Hippe (also known as Melanippe meaning \"dark horse\" or Euippe, \"good horse\"), Ende\u00efs, and Ocyrhoe, and one son of Carystus.

The family Cheironidae, famous for their knowledge of medicine, is considered its descendant. Although it is a centaur, Kheiron's physical appearance is somewhat different from other centaurs, showing his status and wisdom. In the traditional Greek depiction of Kheiron, his forelimbs are human legs, not horses, in contrast to the traditional depictions of centaurus, which has the entire lower body of a horse. This clearly distinguishes Kheiron from other centaurs, making him easily recognizable. This distinction may also highlight the unique genealogy of Kheiron, as the son of Kronos. Kheiron is often depicted carrying a twig with a dead rabbit that he catches hanging there. Kheiron is also often depicted wearing clothes, suggesting that he is more civilized and unlike a normal centaur (the only occasional exceptions are the centaurs Nessus and Pholus). The Education of Achilles fresco of the basilica in Herculaneum (top right), is one of the most common Roman depictions of Kheiron, as he taught the lute to Achilles. In this version, we see Kheiron with a completely horse lower body, in contrast to the depiction of ancient Greece. In addition to this reconfiguration, Kheiron's appearance has changed even more with his ears. Whereas once a human being, Kheiron's ears are now the same as satirical ears; folded on top. This rendering creates a more beast version of Kheiron, much more similar to the standard centaur. Perhaps because of the emergence of written sources, Roman artists were inspired by written descriptions of Kheiron; just use the word centaur, rather than having a traditional visual representation available. This, then, may not be a deliberate reworking of the Kheiron myth of the Romans, but merely a nuance of character lost in his migration from Greece to Rome.

However, when coupled with a province in the form of an archipelago separated from the mainland of Sumatra Island, Bengkulu Province is the third smallest province out of ten provinces on the island of Sumatra, after the Riau Islands Province and the Bangka Belitung Islands Province. The following are the territorial boundaries of Bengkulu Province: In the Bengkulu region there were once kingdoms based on ethnicity such as the Serut River Kingdom, the Selebar Kingdom, the Pat Petulai Kingdom, the Balai Buntar Kingdom, the Lemau River Kingdom, the Sekiris Kingdom, the Gedung Agung Kingdom, and the Marau Riang Kingdom. Under the Sultanate of Banten, they became vazals. Part of Bengkulu has also been under the rule of the Inderapura Kingdom since the 17th century. The British East India Company (EIC) since 1685 established a pepper trading centre. Bencoolen/Coolen which comes from the English Cut Land which means broken land this region is the most active earthquake fault area in the world and then a storage warehouse in what is now Bengkulu City. ", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "At that time, the EIC expedition was led by Ralph Ord and William Cowley to find a replacement for the pepper trading center after the Port of Banten fell to the VOC, and the EIC was prohibited from trading there. The treaty with the Kingdom of Selebar on 12 July 1685 allowed the British to erect fortifications and various trading buildings. Fort York was erected in 1685 around the mouth of the Serut River. From 1713, the fort of Marlborough (completed 1719) was built, which is still standing today. However, this company gradually realized that the place was unprofitable because it could not produce sufficient amounts of pepper. Since the implementation of the Treaty of London in 1824, Bengkulu was handed over to the Dutch, in exchange for Malacca as well as an affirmation of the ownership of Tumasik / Singapore and Belitung Island). Since the treaty, Bengkulu has become part of the Dutch East Indies. The discovery of gold deposits in the Rejang Lebong area in the second half of the 19th century made the place a gold mining center until the 20th century. Currently, commercial mining activities have been suspended since the end of the deposit. In the 1930s, Bengkulu became a dumping ground for a number of independence-supporting activists, including Sukarno. It was during this time that Sukarno became acquainted with Fatmawati who later became his wife. After Indonesian independence, Bengkulu became a residency within the province of South Sumatra. The Bengkulu area used to also include Kawedanan Krui which included the current West Lampung and West Coast Regencies. However, based on the results of the plebiscite in 1951, Krui became part of Lampung. On November 18, 1968 Bengkulu became the 26th Indonesian province (the youngest before East Timor). Bengkulu Province consists of 9 districts, 1 municipality, 128 sub-districts, 172 sub-districts, and 1,341 villages.

At the end of his reign he declared that he wanted to be worshipped as a god. Kertajaya was defeated by Ken Arok of Tumapel or Singhasari, which marked the end of the Panjalu kingdom. The name Kertajaya is found in the Book of Nagarakretagama (1365) by Mpu Prapanca which was made during the Majapahit period hundreds of years after the Panjalu period. Historical evidence of the existence of Kertajaya figures is the discovery of the Broom Angin Inscription (1190), Galunggung Inscription (1194), Kamulan Inscription (1194), Palah Inscription (1197), Biri Inscription, and Lawadan Inscription (1205). From these inscriptions, it can be known that the name of the title abhiseka Kertajaya is Paduka Sri Maharaja Sri Sarweswara Triwikramawatara Anindita Srenggalancana Digjaya Uttunggadewa. In Pararaton Maharaja Kertajaya is called by the name of Prabu Dandhang Gendis. It is said that at the end of his reign the stability of the Panjalu kingdom began to decline. This condition was because the king intended to reduce the rights of the Brahmins. The prabu stated that he wanted to be worshipped like a god. Prabu Dandhang Gendis' request certainly met with resistance from the priests as well as the Hindu and Buddhist Brahmins. Although Prabu Dandhang Gendis showed his power by sitting cross-legged on a sharp spear standing. Some people who did not want to admit Kertajaya's maturity were forced to be tortured severely until they died. Meanwhile, those who recognize their maturity will be exempted from all punishment and given an honorable position. The Brahmins and the priests who were terrified of them chose to flee the capital Daha, and because of his misdeeds and behavior, Kertajaya continued to receive rejection from the Brahmins. The Brahmins chose to leave the royal capital of Panjalu. They stepped aside while continuing to tell the misguidance of maharaja Kertajaya, to all the people of the kingdom he met.

With the support of the Brahmins, Ken Arok then appointed himself king and declared the Tumapel region an independent kingdom, independent of Panjalu. Knowing this, Kertajaya then prepared an army to attack Tumapel. Dandhang Gendis is not afraid at all. He claimed that he could only be defeated by Shiva. Hearing this, Ken Arok also used the title Bhatara Guru (another name Shiva) and moved to lead the army to attack Panjalu. Ken Arok with the support of the Brahmins made an attack on the Kingdom of Panjalu. The two armies had met near the village of Ganter, east of Kadiri. The war between Tumapel and Panjalu was fought so fiercely near the ganter village area. The Panjalu warlords Mahisa Walungan (Dandhang Gendis's younger brother) and Gubar Baleman died at the hands of Ken Arok. Dandhang Gendis himself escaped and hid up towards kahyangan. Nagarakretagama also briefly recounted the news of Kertajaya's defeat. It is mentioned that Kertajaya escaped and hid in the dewalaya (the realm where the deity is). Both texts report that Kertajaya's escape place is the divine realm. It is likely that Kertajaya hid in a temple of worship, or Kertajaya died and went to the divine realm. Since 1222 Panjalu has been a vassal area of Tumapel. According to Nagarakretagama, Kertajaya's son, Jayasabha, appointed Ken Arok as the deputy regent of Kadiri. In 1258 Jayasabha was succeeded by his son, whose name was Sastrajaya. Then in 1271 Sastrajaya was succeeded by his son, Jayakatwang, who became the regent of Gelanggelang.

The rotation begins near the central part of the cloud and extends downwards. If it continues below the cloud base and reaches ground level, it is a tornado. Meso-cyclones rotate slowly (usually counterclockwise). A cyclone meso is a storm-scale region of rotation that can cause a tornado, accompanied by a lightning strike. Scientists call this rotation a meso cyclone when it is detected by Doppler radar. The warm air flow rotates vigorously, which can develop into a supercell storm. Meso cyclones are often found near upward air currents behind storms. Supercells are the rarest type of thunderstorm. Thunderstorms need to have organized and strong upward air currents to produce damaging winds and large hail, but cyclone meso must be present in for tornadogenesis to occur. In order for a meso cyclone to form, there needs to be some thing going on in the atmosphere. There needs to be a change in wind direction and an increase in wind speed as the altitude increases. This will create a horizontal center in the lower atmosphere (stage 1). Even in an environment where there is no lightning rhino activity, now a meso cyclone has formed. Now that the meso climate has been formed, the air inside the upward air current tilts the rotating air column from horizontal to vertical (stage 2). After the rotation is tilted vertically, a locally lowered cloud base known as a wall cloud, usually forms within an upward air current (stage 3). It is in the territory of this supercell that tornadoes will form. Wind sliding (red) regulates the rotation of air (green).

He rejected his father's wish for him to pursue a career in politics and wandered around Europe for several years. Like other bright and turbulent young people, he joined the monastery. In the monastery of Bec, Normandy, under the care of a great teacher, Lanfranc, Anselmus began a noteworthy career. His notable works are Cur Deus Homo and Proslogion. In 1066 William of Normandy conquered England. In the following years, the new king brought many Normandy teachers and monks to England. Among them was Lanfranc, who became Archbishop of Canterbury in 1070. Anselmus took the place of adviser as abbot of Bec. In 1093, William II, son of the conqueror, appointed Anselmus Archbishop of Canterbury. But it was not a move that improved church and state relations. The stubborn and aggressive king took away the right of placement of priests in his kingdom. Anselmus, a simple man who wanted to protect the Church, its land and funds from the clutches of greedy kings, refused that. For a time the Archbishop lived in exile in Italy. William confiscated all the funds channeled to Canterbury. When William died, his brother Henry I succeeded him. Although he asked Anselmus to return, the \"battle\" between church and state did not end. Henry was as evil as his brother, and once again Anselmus lived in exile.

While in exile, he had proven that he was a great theologian, because it was at this time that he wrote his great works.

Although Anselmus knew the Bible well, he wanted to test the power of human logic in his efforts to prove his doctrine. But it's always faith that underlies all of that. In his work Proslogion, which was originally titled Faith Seeking Understanding (Fides Quaerens Intellectum), Anselmus adhered to a motto that Augustine also held, \"I believe then I exist\" (credo ergo sum). What he meant by that statement is that without revelation, there is no truth therefore those who seek the truth must first have faith in the revelation. He put forward the argument of ontology (information that can lead to the discovery of something important) to believe in God. In short, he states that the ratio of man requires the idea of a perfect Person (God), therefore that Person must exist. This idea has captivated the hearts of many philosophers and theologians throughout time. In his book \"Why God Became Human\" (Latin: Cur Deus Homo) published in 1908, Anselmus wrote down the theory of how Christ's death on the cross, which reconciled man to God. According to Anselmus, God is the Lord of the universe, whose glory is tainted by the sins of man. Although He wants to forgive man, in order for moral order to be restored in the universe, He cannot simply \"turn a blind eye\" to sin. There must be a sacrifice, something worth the offense. According to Anselmus, Since sin comes from man, the sacrifice must also be made by man. But man cannot offer a sacrifice because of the sin that makes it impossible for man to make peace with God. Therefore, Christ the Perfect and obedient to death became the redeemer by dying on the cross.

The initial capital of the Air Force was the looted aircraft of the Japanese army such as the Cureng, Nishikoren, and Hayabusha types. It was these aircraft that were the forerunners of the founding of the Air Force. After the decision of the Round Table Conference in 1949, the Air Force received several Dutch Air Force assets including aircraft, hangars, maintenance depots, and other logistics depots. Some of the Dutch aircraft that were taken over included the C-47 Dakota, B-25 Mitchell, P-51 Mustang, AT-6 Harvard, PBY-5 Catalina, and Lockheed L-12.

The screw micrometer has an accuracy of 0.01 mm. This tool features calibrated screws that are widely used to accurately measure components. In everyday life, screw micrometers are used by refrigerator servicemen and water pumps to measure the diameter of copper wires that will be used to replace wire coils that have been damaged. Micrometers are also used in telescopes and microscopes, each of which is to measure the pseudo-diameter of celestial bodies and the diameter of microscopic objects. The micrometer used with the telescope was invented around 1638 by William Gascoigne, an English astronomer. Biological objects/targets observed with a microscope have micron (\u03bc) sizes/dimensions. For measurements (length, width, diameter) of a microscopic object an ocular micrometer is used. The ocular micrometer is a flattened round, in the center of which there is a scale 'resembling' a ruler numbered 0, 10, 20,.., 100. The ocular micrometer is used by incinerating on the ocular lens. The scale on the ocular micrometer is determined by the unit value of its length using an objective micrometer. This method is called calibration. Measurement through a micrometer includes measuring the size of the cell, as well as the diameter of the field of view of an objective lens. The benefit or relevance of micrometry is that the number of cells in each area or field of view can be used to determine the concentration of cells in a sample. The use of micrometers can help the measurement of the inner structure whose preparations have been prepared Objective micrometers in the form of glass slides, in the middle of which there is a scale without numbers as many as 100 units, such as a ruler. The scale is covered with a round-shaped slip cover.

One micrometer is fixed using one pitch-point screw mechanism. One additional interesting feature of micrometers-micrometers is the infusion of one stalk into a filled bent. Normally, one could use the mechanical advantages of screws to press the material, giving one inaccurate measurement. By installing one stalk whose gears are in the same direction as the desire at one particular rotational power. The word micrometer comes from the neoclassical word meaning micros from Greece, meaning \"small\", and metron, meaning \"size\". The Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary says that micrometers in English were absorbed from French and their appearance was first known in English-language writing in 1670. Neither meter, micrometer (\u03bcm), nor micrometer (device/tool) as we know it today, did not exist at that time. However, people at that time had a strong desire and interest in the ability to measure small objects. The word was undoubtedly coined in connection with the undertaking. The screw micrometer was first invented by William Gascoigne in the 17th century, as a refinement of the vernier scale; used in telescopes to measure the angular distance between stars and the relative size of celestial bodies. Henry Maudslay built a bench micrometer in the early 19th century that was jokingly dubbed \"Lord Chancellor\" by his staff in reference to the tool's ability to give the final say on the accuracy and precision of measurements in corporate work.

Jayanagara's reign is famous as a time of upheaval in the early history of the Majapahit empire. He himself died as a result of being killed by Ra Tanca, his court physician. According to Pararaton, Jayanagara's real name is Kalagemet son of Wijaya and Dara Petak. His mother is from the Dharmasraya Kingdom on the island of Sumatra. He was taken by Kebo Anabrang to Java ten days after the expulsion of the Mongol forces by the Majapahit side. Wijaya, who had previously had two wives of Kertanagara's daughters, then made Dara Petak the wife of Tinuheng Pura, or \"the wife who was aged in the palace\". According to Pararaton, the expulsion of the Mongol army and the establishment of the Majapahit Kingdom took place in 1294. Meanwhile, according to Chinese chronicles from the Yuan dynasty, the army led by Ike Mese left Java on April 24, 1293. The Nagarakretagama manuscript also mentions the number 1293. Thus, if the above news is combined, then the arrival of Kebo Anabrang and Dara Petak can be estimated to have occurred on May 4, 1293, and the birth of Jayanagara occurred in 1294. The name Dara Petak is not found in Nagarakretagama and inscriptions left by Majapahit. According to Nagarakretagama, Wijaya not only married two, but four daughters of Kertanagara, namely Tribhuwaneswari, Narendraduhita, Jayendradewi, and Gayatri. Meanwhile, Jayanagara was born to a wife named Indreswari. ", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "This led to the conjecture that Indreswari was another name for Dara Petak. Nagarakretagama mentions Jayanagara being appointed yuwaraja or viceroy in Kadiri or Daha in 1295. Jayanagara's name also appears in the Penanggungan inscription of 1296 as crown prince. Considering that Raden Wijaya married Dara Petak in 1293, Jayanagara was certainly still very small when he was appointed as viceroy. Of course his reign is represented by the Sora Ox mentioned in the Pananggungan inscription serving as the patih of Daha. From the inscription, it can also be known that Jayanagara is a real name since childhood or Garbhopati, not a title name or abhiseka. While the name Kalagemet introduced by Pararaton is clearly mockery, because the name means \"evil\" and \"weak\", it is because Jayanagara's personality is filled with immoral behavior but weak as a ruler that many rebellions arose during his reign. Jayanagara ascended the throne to become king of Majapahit in place of his father who according to Nagarakretagama died in 1309. From the Sidateka Charter dated 1323, Jayanagara established the composition of the katrini mahamantri in assisting his government, which is as follows: According to Pararaton, Jayanagara's rule was marred by many rebellions by his father's followers. This is because Jayanagara is a mixed-blood Javanese-Malay king, not a descendant of pure Kertanagara. The first revolt occurred when Jayanagara ascended the throne, which was carried out by Ranggalawe in 1295 and then Ox Sora in 1300. In this case the author of Pararaton is less thorough because Jayanagara only became king in 1309. Perhaps the truth is, the Ranggalawe rebellion occurred when Jayanagara was appointed viceroy or crown prince. It is also possible that the Ranggalawe rebellion actually occurred in 1309. Pararaton also reported on the rebellions of Juru Demung in 1313, the Blue Elephant in 1314, Mandana and Pawagal in 1316, and Ra Semi in 1318.

This regency is directly adjacent to 5 regencies, namely in the northern part with Tuban Regency, the eastern part with Lamongan Regency, the southern part with Nganjuk Regency, Madiun Regency, and Ngawi Regency, and the western part with Blora Regency (Central Java). As the main entrance gate of East Java from the west, the western region of Bojonegoro (border with Central Java) is part of the Cepu Block, one of the main sources of petroleum deposits in Indonesia. As of the 2020 population census, the population of Bojonegoro Regency is 1,339,100 people with a density of 580 people/km2. The historical life period of Ancient Indonesia was marked by the strong influence of Hindu culture that came from India from the First Century. Along with the establishment of the Demak Sultanate in the 16th century, Bojonegoro became the territory of the Demak Sultanate. With the development of a new culture, namely Islam, the influence of Hindu culture was pressed and there was a shift in values and societal systems from the old values of Hinduism to the new values of Islam accompanied by war in an effort to seize the power of Majapahit (wilwatikta). The transition of power accompanied by upheaval brought Bojonegoro into the territory of the Pajang Sultanate (1586), and then the Mataram Sultanate (1587). On October 20, 1677, the status of Jipang, which was previously a duchy, was changed to a regency with Wedana the Regent of Wetan Foreign Affairs, Mas Tumapel who also concurrently served as Regent I based in Jipang. This date until now is commemorated as the anniversary of Bojonegoro Regency. In 1725, when Sunan Pakubuwono II (Kasunanan Surakarta) ascended the throne, the seat of government of Jipang Regency was moved from Jipang to Rajekwesi, about 10 km south of the present city of Bojonegoro.

Antigens are molecules or molecular structures, such as those located on the outside of a pathogen, that can be bound by antibodies specific to those antigens or by B cell antigen receptors. The abbreviation Ag itself stands for antibody generator or antibody generator. Antigens are \"targeted\" by antibodies. Each antibody is produced specifically by the immune system to be adjusted for the antigen after the cells in the immune system come into contact with the antigen; This process is used to precisely identify antigens, produce appropriate antibodies, and initiate the onset of an adaptive immune response. An antibody is said to \"correspond\" to an antigen in the sense that it can bind to it as a result of molecular adaptations to antigen-binding fragments. In most cases, antibodies can only react and bind to one specific antigen; In some other cases, antibodies can cross-react and bind to more than one antigen. Antigens can be protein molecules, peptides (amino acid chains), and polysaccharides (simple monosaccharide/sugar chains), while lipid molecules and nucleic acids become antigens only when combined with proteins and polysaccharides. Antigens can come from within the body (\"self-antigens\") or from the external environment (\"non-self\" or \"foreign bodies\"). The immune system identifies and attacks external antigens in the form of \"foreign bodies\" and usually does not react to self-gens due to negative selection of T cells in the thymus. Vaccines are examples of antigens in immunogenic form, which are deliberately given to recipients to induce the memory function of the immune system adaptive to antigens from pathogens that attack those recipients.

In 1899, Ladislas Deutsch (L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Detre) (1874\u20131939) named hypothetical substances that were between bacterial and antibody constituents as \"substances immunogenes ou antigenes\" (antigenic or immunogenic substances). He initially believed that the substance became a precursor to antibodies, just as zimogen is a precursor to enzymes. However, in 1903, he understood that antigens induce the production of immune bodies (antibodies) and wrote that the word antigen stands for antisomatogen (Immunk\u00f6rperbildner). The Oxford English Dictionary indicates that its logical construction should be \"anti(body)-gene\". Antigens are substances that bind to antibodies and antigen receptors in lymphocytes. Meanwhile, immunogens are a term for antigens that are recognized by the body as foreign bodies, triggering an adaptive immune response. Not all antigens are immunogenic. To be immunogenic, an antigen must have a high molecular weight, exhibit chemical complexity, as well as show alienation (considered a foreign or \"non-self\" body). Antigenic molecules, normally large biological polymers, usually have surface features that can act as interaction points for certain antibodies. Such a feature is an epitope, that is, a certain part of the antigen recognized by the immune system. The epitope has certain characteristics so it is called an antigenic determinant. Most antigens have the potential to be bound by multiple antibodies, each of which is specific to one of the antigen's epitopes. Using the metaphor \"padlock and key\", the antigen can be seen as a series of keys (epitopes) that each match a different padlock (antibody).

It usually symbolizes the rounded closed back vowel (u]), replacing the function of the letter V which switches as a symbol Of the voiced lip-tooth hissing consonant. The letter U comes from a variation of the letter V in ancient Rome. Its origin is from the Greek upsilon letter, which symbolizes the vowel /y/. At the end of the Middle Ages, two forms of letters appeared, namely V and U, both of which were used for the sounds /u/ and /v/. The tapered V-shape is written at the beginning of the word, while the round U-shape is used in the middle or end of the word regardless of the sound. Therefore, words like valour and excuse are the same as spellings today, but the words have and upon are also written haue and vpon. Finally in the 1700s, in order for consonant and vowel sounds to be separated, the V shape signified a consonant while the U form was for vowels, so the modern letter U was born. It was during this time that the uppercase U was created; before this it was always used uppercase V. Initially, since the letters you and V were made separate letters, V preceded U in alphabetical order, but now the opposite is true. The letter u was included in the Roman alphabet by Petrus Ramus in the 16th century. In most languages that use the Latin alphabet system, you represent a round closed back vowel sound, u (info), as well as in the International Phonetic Alphabet.

This article focuses attention on understanding the typical interpersonal relationships. In this sense, the term \"friendship\" describes a relationship that involves knowledge, appreciation, affection and feelings . Friends will welcome the presence of their fellows and show loyalty to each other, often to altruism. Their tastes are usually similar and may meet each other, and they enjoy the activities they love. They will also engage in helpful behaviors, such as exchanging counsel and helping each other in difficulties. A friend is a person who exhibits reciprocating and reflective behavior. But for many, friendship is often nothing more than the belief that someone or something won't harm or hurt them. The value found in friendships is often what results when a friend demonstrates consistently: There is often a presumption that true friends are capable of expressing the deepest feelings, which may not be expressed, except in very difficult circumstances, when they come to help. Compared to personal relationships, friendships are considered closer than just acquaintances, although in friendships or relationships between acquaintances there are different levels of intimacy.

Platonism greatly influenced the European realm of mind. Platonism at least justifies the existence of abstract objects, which are said to be in a third realm, that is, a realm that is different from the innerable outward realm and the inner realm of consciousness, and therefore contrary to nominalism. Such abstract objects can be proprieties, types, propositions, meanings, numbers, sets, truth values, and so on (cf. abstract object theory). Philosophers who justify the existence of abstract objects are sometimes called \"platonists\", while philosophers who deny them are sometimes called \"nomineists\". The terms \"platonism\" and \"nominalism\" also have a predetermined meaning in the history of philosophy, namely as designations for stances that have almost nothing to do with modern understanding of abstract objects. In a narrow sense, this term can refer to the teachings of Platonic Realism. The main concept of Platonism, the essential differentiator of the Theory of Being, is the distinction between a distorted but incomprehensible reality, and an unabsorbed but understood reality. Forms are usually presented in dialogues such as Faidon, Simposion, and Politeia as perfect and transcendent archetypes, on which the natural objects of everyday life are merely imperfect imitations. In Polytheia, the highest being is understood as the Form of Virtue, the source of all other beings, which can be known by reason. In Sofistes, one of the later written works, forms of circumstances, similarities and differences are among the primordial \"Great Varieties\". In the 3rd century BC, Archesilaos adopted skepticism, which became the main postulate of the Platonism school until 90 BC, when Antiochus added Stoic elements, rejected skepticism, and ushered in a new era known as middle Platonism.

Djet and Merneith's son is Den, and their grandson is Anedjib. How long Djet's decision will take is unknown. Only one Sekar festival is evidenced by the ivory label dating his reign, the length of which is estimated to be between six and ten years old. According to Wolfgang Helck he reigned for 10 years. From calendar records, Djer is known to have died on 7 Peret III while Djet began his reign on 22 Peret IV. The reason for the 45 days of interregnum is unknown. Details of Djet's reign are lost in the Palermo Inscription lakuna. However, the discovery of vessel fragments and seal prints proves that there was intense trade activity with Syria and Palestine at the time. Tombs in Tarkan and Saqqara that originated in his reign produced pottery from Palestine. Other activities can be inferred from two known year-anniversary stones of the ruler, one of which is preserved in two copies. The reading of the events described in the memorial stone is very problematic. Helck translated: \"The year of underground planning, Double plant, the birth of lotus buds, stands in the temple of the second crown of the Mistress.\" Another year's memorial stone mentions a victory, the production (birth) of a statue and possibly the creation of a fortress.

Poetry is one of the old poems that originated in Persia and was brought into Indonesian literature along with the entry of Islamic teachings into Indonesia. The number of lines on the verse is four lines with the number of syllables between eight to ten syllables. The verse section as a whole contains only the contents and has no sampiran. The rhyme used on the verse is patterned a-a-a-a. The content of the verse can be romantic stories, historical events, religious teachings. Verses can also contain allusions or verses. The word Syair comes from the Arabic Syu'your which means feeling. The word Syu'your evolved into the word Shi'ru which means poetry. In its development, the verse undergoes changes and modifications so that the verses are designed according to the circumstances and situations that occur. In its development in Southeast Asia, the verse underwent changes and modifications so that it became uniquely Malay, no longer referring to the literary tradition of verse in arab lands. The poet who played a major role in shaping typical Malay verses was Hamzah Fansuri with his work, including Syair Perahu, Syair Burung Pingai, Syair Dagang, and Syair Sidang Fakir.

This naming is based on the use of ideas that have actually happened and must be accepted as reality. The balance in the verse takes the form of a repetition of the same sound at the end of each stanza in the whole verse. The form of balance in the verse is a pattern of rhythm or musicalization.

Desertification is generally caused by various factors such as climate change and human activities. Desertification is a significant global environmental and ecological problem. Various controversies are present in determining a viable definition of the term desertification. Helmut Geist (2005) has invented 100 formal definitions, but the broader accepted definition is the definition from the Princeton University campus which defines desertification as \"the process of transforming arable land into desert, generally the result of deforestation, drought, or unfit agricultural practices.\" The earliest discussion of this topic came after the French colonization of West Africa when a study committee conducted research to find out the process of expanding the Sahara Desert in prehistoric times. The desert known today was formed through a natural process over a very long period of time. During this time, the desert has expanded and shrunk without the role of human intervention. The prehistoric desert was larger than the widest desert today, the Sahara, and can be called a sea of sand, which is now stable due to vegetation. Desertification played an important role in human history, which contributed to the collapse of several great empires such as the Carthagens, Greeks, and Romans, and led to large-scale population movements. Dry land covers 40-41% of the earth's land area and is home to 2 billion inhabitants. It is estimated that 10-20% of dry land has been degraded. Until 1998, the expansion towards the south of the Sahara Desert was unknown due to the lack of measurements of the expansion at that time. The three main locations that became the center of civilization in ancient times, namely the Mediterranean, Mesopotamia, and the loessial plateau in China were previously densely populated areas until desertification occurred. ", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "The main cause of desertification is the disappearance of vegetation that occurs due to various things such as drought, climate change, agricultural activities, grazing of excess animals, and forestry. Vegetation plays an important role in determining the biological composition of the soil. A study showed that in various environments, the rate of erosion and flow of surface water decreases exponentially with the increase in the area of vegetation cover. Unprotected dryland surfaces will be blown away by the wind or washed away by flash floods, leaving an infertile soil layer and roasted by sunlight and not being productive. However, another study showed that the movement of farm animals and wild animals became the main determining factor in maintaining vegetation and soil quality, and the disappearance of farm animals and wild animals was one of the causes of desertification. Methods for mitigating or reversing the effects of desertification have been proposed, but there are obstacles in applying them. One of them is sustainable agricultural practices that are known to reduce desertification, sometimes costing more than farmers' profits. Another problem is the low political motivation and financing in land reclamation and anti-desertification programs. Desertification is known as a major problem with biodiversity. Several countries have developed Biodiversity Action Plans to prevent such effects, primarily to protect threatened species of flora and fauna. Reforestation is able to prevent desertification from the root of the problem, namely forestry. Environmental organizations such as the Eden Reforestation Projects work on the scope where foresting and desertification contribute to poverty. They focus on fostering local communities on forestry and empowering them to grow seedlings planted in the rainy season on land that has been cut down. Mitigation and prevention generally focus on two basic aspects, namely water supply and fertilizing the soil.

The name is taken from the suggestion to return to the understanding of the ancestors (salaf), the three early generations of Muslims who knew the pure teachings of Islam without any additions and subtractions. Those generations included the Islamic Prophet Muhammad and the companions he taught himself (the Companions), their successors (Tabiin), and successors (Tabi'ut Tabi'in). In practical terms, Salafists argue that Muslims should rely on the Qur'an, Sunnah and Ijma' (consensus) of salaf, giving them priority over later interpretations of religion. The movement aims to renew Muslim life and it has exerted a great influence on many Muslim thinkers and movements throughout the Islamic World. Since its inception, Salafism has developed through the efforts of various Islamic reformers, whose activities are scattered in different regions. The term Salafi was coined by Ibn Taimiyah in the 8th century Hijri, and Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahhab revived the term in the Najd region in the 12th century CE, which made Salafi a reform movement founded by one of the most prominent representatives of the modern era. Salafi doctrine is based on looking back to the early years of the Islamic religion to understand how contemporary Muslims should practice their faith. Salafists reject religious innovations or heresies and support the application of sharia (Islamic law). In its approach to politics, the movement is sometimes divided by Western academics and journalists into three categories: the largest group is the puritans (or taciturn), who avoid politics;  the second largest group is the activists, who maintain regular involvement in politics;  and the third group is the jihadists, who form a minority and advocate an armed struggle to restore the early Islamic movement.

In the contemporary era, Salafism refers to a group of different Sunni renewal and reform movements and has remained a significant trend in Islamic thought for more than a century. Contemporary Salafiyah was formed as a revivalist movement throughout the Muslim World during the late 19th century in the context of European Imperialism. The word salafiyah taken from the word \"Salaf\" is short for \"Salaf al-\u1e62h\u0101li\u1e25\" (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0627\u0644\u062d), meaning \"predecessor of the sholih\". In Islamic terminology in general, it is used to refer to the three best generations of muslims namely friends, tabi'in, tabi'ut tabi'in. These three generations are considered the best examples of practicing Islamic law. The word salafi is often associated with Wahhabism (for most of its followers, this Wahabi name is considered derogatory; they prefer the term Salafism), so these two terms are often seen as synonyms. Usually, its adherents of the salafy movement describe themselves as \"Muwahidin,\" \"Ahl Hadith,\" or \"Ahl at-Tawhid.\" The main teaching of the basic salafist ideology is that Islam was perfect and completed by the time of Muhammad and his companions, therefore there is no possibility of innovation or addition and reduction in Islamic sharia due to the influence of customs and culture. Salafist ideology seeks to revive Islamic practices that are in keeping with the religion of Muhammad first proselytizing. Salafism has also been described as a simplified version and knowledge of Islam. Its adherents followed several commandments and practices that were only in accordance with Muhammad's instructions.

He found Magnetophon with AC pretitution while on Radio Frankfurt. The tool produces much better fidelity than shellac recordings. Mullin brought two Magnetophon recorders and 50 rolls of BASF Type L tape to America and he produced a modified version. He showed his results to Radio Technician in San Francisco on May 16, 1946. Bing Crosby, a major radio star at the time, acquired the idea of recording his radio programs. He doesn't like scheduled live broadcasts and much prefers the relaxed atmosphere of the recording studio. He had asked the NBC network to let him pre-record his broadcasts for 1944-1945 on transcription discs, but the network refused, so Crosby withdrew from live radio broadcasting for a year and with a heavy heart returned only for the 1946-1947 season on the then newly established ABC radio. In June 1947, Mullin, who was offering the technology to major Hollywood film studios, had the opportunity to demonstrate his modified tape recorder to Crosby. When Crosby heard a demonstration of Mullin's tape recorder, he quickly saw the potential of the new technology and asked Mullin to prepare a trial recording of his radio show. Ampex was finalizing a prototype Model 200 tape recorder and Mullin used the first two models as soon as it was built. After the trial broadcast was successful, ABC agreed to allow Crosby to record his shows on the ribbon.

Its free element, a silvery metal with a gray stain, has a melting point of 6th among all elements. It easily forms stable and hard carbides in alloying metals, and for this reason, most of the world production of this element (about 80%) is used in steel alloys, including high-strength alloys and superalloys. Most molybdenum compounds have low solubility in water, but when the molybdenum minerals are exposed to oxygen and water, the resulting MoO molybdate ions are sufficiently soluble. On an industrial scale, molybdenum compounds (about 14% of world production) are used in high-pressure and high-temperature applications as pigments and catalysts. Molybdenum-binding enzymes are by far the most common bacterial catalysts for breaking chemical bonds in atmospheric nitrogen molecules in the process of nitrogen fixation. At least 50 molybdenum enzymes are now known in bacteria and animals, although only bacterial enzymes and cyanobacteria are involved in nitrogen fixation. This nitrogenase contains molybdenum in a different form than other molybdenum enzymes, all of which contain fully oxidized molybdenum in the molybdenum cofactor. This variety of molybdenum cofactor enzymes is essential for the organism, and molybdenum is an essential element for life in all higher eukaryotic organisms, although not in all bacteria.

Mo has a melting point of 2,623 \u00b0C (4,753 \u00b0F; 2,896 K); Of the natural elements, only tantalum, osmium, rhenium, tungsten and carbon have a higher melting point. Weak oxidation of molybdenum begins at 300 \u00b0C (572 \u00b0F; 573 K). It is the one that has the lowest coefficient of thermal expansion among commercially used metals. The tensile strength of molybdenum cables increases about 3 times, from about 10 to 30 GPa, when their diameter decreases from ~50-100 nm to 10 nm. There are 35 known isotopes of molybdenum, with an atomic mass range between 83 and 117, as well as four metastable nuclear isomers. Seven isotopes occur naturally, with atomic masses of 92, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, and 100. Of these natural isotopes, only molybdenum-100 is unstable. Molybdenum-98 is the most abundant isotope, which makes up 24.14% of all molybdenum. Molybdenum-100 has a half-life of about 1019 years and undergoes double beta decay to ruthenium-100. Molybdenum isotopes with mass numbers 111 to 117 all have a half-life of about 150 ns. All unstable isotopes of molybdenum decay into isotopes of niobium, technetium, and ruthenium. As also noted below, the most common isotopic application of molybdenum involves molybdenum-99, which is a fission product. It is the parent radioisotope for gamma-emitting and short-lived daughter radioisotopes technetium-99m, a nuclear isomer used in various imaging applications in medicine. In 2008, Delft University of Technology filed a patent application for the production of molybdenum-99 based on molybdenum-98. Molybdenum is a transition metal with an electronegativity of 2.16 on the Pauling scale and a standard atomic weight of 95.95 g/mol.

In general, stems have the following properties: Many plants have exceptions from those mentioned above, either only one or a few characteristics. In line with the theory that is widely embraced now, that vascular plants are a further development of one of the groups of chlorophyll talus plants, namely Charophyta, stems are the development of talus which then differentiate their tissues, forming a network of vessels. Roots are the development of ancient stems located near the soil surface which later specialized as a means of absorbing water. True leaves, which belong to most vascular plant members, are thought to be formed from the union of small twigs that are close to each other and still carry chlorophyll and other pigments. This theory is known as the megaphyll theory. The leaves of the Lycophyta group are thought to have formed from another evolutionary path, that is, they were formed from part of the sporangium.

The name \"sura\" is taken from one of the religious anniversaries in the first month of the Islamic calendar, namely the commemoration of Ashura which falls on the 10th of Muharram. The month of Sura is implicated with the month of Muharram, although the beginning or end may be different. This month is 30 days old. On the 1st of Sura, which according to javanese dating counts began before the fall of maghrib time towards the evening of the previous day, several rituals were performed in a number of places in Java as well as by certain groups of followers of the spiritual sect. One of the most covered memorial rituals is the heirloom kirab in two palaces in Surakarta City. The 1st of Sura or 1st of Muharram is a national holiday in Indonesian jurisdiction, as the \"Hijri New Year\".

The following information comes from the instructions for the procedures for the implementation of the palace heritage kirab (Lampah-lampahipun Miyosipun Pusakadalem). The activity began with preparations after Asar's time. The heirlooms to be reclaimed have been previously cleaned (washed) and the washing water collected. Heirlooms are stored in the heirloom room. Guests and participants of the male kirab wore black beskap, batik design, with iket (blangkon) and wore a kris. Guests and participants of the women's kirab wore batik kemben or wore a black kebaya, with a bun.

The motorcade begins with the relatives of the palace, then the heirlooms one by one are issued to the pendh\u00e5p\u00e5. Each heirloom will be accompanied by a group of officers. Of the five heirlooms, four of them are spears. The kirab route is a road that circles the palace, turning clockwise, starting from the south gate of the Palace. The procession of kirab is carried out silently and without light. At the same time in the Mangkunegaran Mosque, the recitation of the holy verses of the Qur'an (s\u00e9ma'an) is carried out. The kirab usually ends near 21 o'clock, and the heirloom is then returned to the heirloom room. After the return of the heirloom was completed, the chairman of the committee reported the implementation of the kirab to Samp\u00e9yandalem Ingkan Jumeneng. At that time, the heirloom washing water that had been prepared in front of the pendhapa would be contested by the residents who had been coming to the Palace since the afternoon. At about 10:00 p.m. relatives of the palace were pleased to meet with the residents and would throw small parcels containing coins and dried flowers to the residents for grabs. After this event, the relatives of the palace will enter the palace to prepare for the tirakat practice at midnight. This meditation ceremony will be prepared from 23:00. Participants were asked to wear traditional black attire. A number of heirlooms (which are not included) will be prepared in Dalem Ageng (throne room). Participants wearing traditional clothes are welcome to enter Dalem Ageng, while those who do not, will sit in the competition. At 24.00, tirakatan (meditation) is carried out for one hour.

Prambors' full name is Prambors Rasisonia, which stands for Prambanan, Mendut, Borobudur and surrounding areas as well as Commercial Social Broadcast Radio. In the beginning, Prambors was a radio broadcast initiated by a group of young people from one adjacent location in Central Jakarta (Jalan Prambanan, Jalan Mendut, Jalan Borobudur, and surrounding areas) that could only be listened to in an area in Jakarta and its surroundings. Some members of Prambors \u2014 Imran Amir, Mursid Rustam, Malik Sjafei and Bambang Wahyudi, as well as Tri Tunggal \u2014 felt the need to support Prambors by establishing a radio transmitter. They assembled a simple transmitter and all kinds of supporting tools at Bambang Wahyudi's house. At that time the turn table was used by them to play songs from vinyl records. In 1970, through PP No. 55 of 1970, the Indonesian government issued a new rule, that every incorporated radio must be in the form of a Limited Liability Company (PT) or Association. Prambors also complied with these rules, so the name was changed to PT Radio Prambors Broadcasting Service. In the 1980s, the deed was changed to PT Radio Prambors. Gradually, Prambors has a community of listeners dominated by young people. The songs and broadcast materials are also adjusted to the segmentation, namely young people. From 1971 to 1978, Prambors became steadier on the youth track. Prambors' products are increasingly diverse, ranging from compilation tapes, to the successful off-air Youth Song Creation Competition (LCLR). In the 1980s, Prambors began to improve because in this era competition with other radio stations began to be felt. One of their efforts to keep the listening community alive is through games. The quizzes developed were quite varied, with quite sensational giveaways in those days, for example, cars.

His most opposed teaching by many figures at the time was about the separation of the God of the Old Testament and the God of the New Testament. The God of the Old Testament, according to him a just, imperfect, cruel and unconscionable God, was fond of punishing with the Law handed down to Moses. His teachings are more akin to Christian Theology of Gnosticism. For him, the laws contained in the Old Testament were too much for man to carry out. It was God who said, \"Love your neighbor and hate your enemies\"; an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.\". Whereas the New Testament God is the good, all-gratuitous, merciful God seen in Jesus.This New Testament God was introduced by Jesus Christ, who sent Him to save man and atone for his sins by bringing the gospel of love to man. Marsion himself lived in Sinope, Pontus, Asia Minor in the years 70-150. Although he is not a gnostic, his views are heavily influenced by gnosticism. Marsion is known to have used only the Gospel of Luke in putting his views. Another view of Marsion is that of Christ teaching that Christ did not really die. Marsion's christology is called docetism: Christ suddenly descended over the city of Capernaum in the 15th year of Tiberius, and then Christ banished the Old Testament God to Hades and redeemed the souls of mankind from the unjust power of God. In ethics he established an ascetic life, abstaining from eating meat, drinking wine and getting married, but he nevertheless accepted the followers of a married couple. In addition was that he committed the baptism of the dead, and was rejected by the official Church. His own followers were scattered in Italy, Egypt, North Africa, Cyprus and Syria.

Furthermore, the Greek translation was circulated among Alexandrian Jews who were fluent in Koine Greek but did not speak Hebrew, while Koine Greek itself was a lingua franca (social language) in Alexandria, Egypt, and the Eastern Mediterranean at the time.

This legend was first discovered in the Epistle of Aristeas (a pseudopygrapha) to his brother Philocrates, and is repeated with interesting additions by Philo of Alexandria, Flavius Josephus, and a variety of later sources, including St. Augustine.

He placed them in 72 cubicles, each in a separate cubicle, without revealing to them why they were called. He walked into everyone's room and said: \"Write to me the Torah of Moshe, your teacher\". God put it in the hearts of each of them to translate identically as all the others did. Filo of Alexandria, which relies heavily on the Septuagint, said that some of the scholars were selected by selecting six scholars from each of the twelve tribes of Israel. The 3rd century BC dating, shown in the legend, is supported (for the translation of the Torah) by a number of factors, for example the Greek presence of the early Koine dialect, quotations beginning as early as the 2nd century BC, early manuscripts from the 2nd century.

Supporters of colonization argued that colonization-colonization laws benefited the colonized country by developing the economic and political infrastructure needed for modernization and democracy. They point to former colonies such as the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong and Singapore as examples of post-colonial success. Proponents of dependency theory such as Andre G.

Etruscans today are not widely discussed. But the result of its civilization still exists today, the Latin alphabet currently used is the cultural result of the Etruscans. The Latin alphabet used in ancient times generally started with a, b, g (such as alpha, beta, gamma in Greek or aleph, beth, gimel in Hebrew). However, philologists know that the Etruscan alphabet begins with a, b, c, the Etruscan language is still difficult to understand and is included as one of the mysteries of the Etruscans. For centuries, historians have speculated about the cultural origins of the Eturians. In its heyday in the fifth century BC, the Etruscans formed a federation of 12 cities with a commercial network that had a wide range, all the way to the territory of Europe and North Africa. But after four centuries later, this area was completely controlled by the new Romans. Historians, archaeologists, and linguists speculated about the origin of the Etruscans for some time. Did they emigrate from Lydia, a province of Asia Minor, as thought by Herodotus, or were they natives of Italy, as stated by Dionysius of Harlicarnassus in the first century BC? Could it be that they have a variegated origin? Whatever the answer, the ethnic and cultural differences between them and the communities around them are so great that today we cannot be sure of their beginnings. Since about the eighth century BC, the Etruscans have lived prosperously throughout central Italy. The Romans called them Tusci, or Etrusci. They are located between the Arno River in the north and the Tiber River in the south, where the area is known as Tuskan. ", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "Etruscan culture once ruled about 50 ancient Italians. Although the Etruscans basically used the early Greek alphabetical form, it is actually very different from any other known language. Most of the vocabulary used by the Etruscans is difficult to translate. However, their literature abounds, as books play an important role in their culture, particularly in matters relating to religion. Although thousands of examples of Etruscan writing still exist today\u2014on tombstones, vases, and sarcophaguses from alabaster\u2014relatively few words are listed so this does little to explain the origin and meaning of these words in Etruscan. The Etruscans were independent city-states, at first the nation was ruled by a king who later changed to a court official (magistrat). These cities united to form the Etruscan league, a religious, economic, and political institution. Some Etruscan houses are equipped with tap water and are located on hard-lined streets, as well as having a good irrigation system. The soil irrigation system is used extensively. By the Etruscan kings, the city of Rome was transformed from a village into a graceful, walled town and had an irrigation network, including the Cloaca Maxima, which can still be seen today. The welfare of the Etruscans comes from the abundant mineral content in their territory, such as the iron mines on Elba Island adjacent to the Eturian region. The Etruscans processed iron, silver, and copper and imported white tin from the British Isles. In addition to the wealth of mining materials, the area they occupied provided fertile farmland and pastures, resulting in cereals, olive oil, and wine and timber. Abundant natural resources and extensive trade at home and abroad helped advance the prosperous economy of the Etruscans.

Lust is a powerful psychological force that causes an intense desire or desire for an object or situation for the fulfillment of that emotion. It can be a lust for knowledge, power, and more; But it is generally associated with sexual appetite. Religions tend to distinguish between passion and lust by categorizing lust as immoral desire and renjana considered as morally accepted lust. Lust is considered immoral because its object or action is contrary to the laws of nature and/or when desire (e.g. sexual desire) controls and governs the person's common sense, it can no longer be controlled by the person's reason and will. Whereas the plan, however powerful it may be, is maintained as something God-given and moral, because the intentions, actions, and intentions behind it are virtues and order towards creation, while also being governed by the person's reason and will. \"Eve lust\" consists of two words: eve (\u0627\u0644\u0647\u0648\u0649) and lust (\u0627\u0644\u0646\u0641\u0633). In Malay, 'lust' means a strong desire, inclination or impulse. When coupled with the word eve (=lust), it is usually associated with a strong impulse to do bad things. Sometimes it means taste, when it comes to food. Lust also means lust or desire to have sex. These three words (eve, lust and shahwat) are of Arabic origin: There is a group of people who regard lust as \"the shaitan that resides in man,\" whose duty is to bring man to ungodliness or denial. Following lust will lead man to corruption. ", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "The result of gratification of lust is much more expensive than the pleasure gained from it. Uncontrollable lust can also damage a person's potential. In fact, everyone is created with extraordinary self-potential, but lust can inhibit that potential from coming to the fore. The potential referred to here is the potential to create justice, tranquility, security, well-being, unity and other good things. However, because of the obstacles to lust that exist in a person, these potentials cannot appear in the reality of life. Therefore, purifying oneself or controlling lust is a necessity for anyone who wants balance, happiness in his life because only by walking the right paths can he achieve this. In the New Testament scriptures Indonesian the LAI translation, the Greek language is found: \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03b8\u03c5\u03bc\u03ad\u03c9 (as written in the Septuagint) is translated into desires that are not sexually related. And also in many English translations: desire, covet, for example, on ASV. Some examples are: Specifically \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03b8\u03c5\u03bc\u03ad\u03c9 in Greek is related to sexual desire (English: lust) for example in Matthew 5:28: \"But I say to you: Everyone who looks upon a woman and desires her, has committed adultery with her in his heart.\" This is likely to cause \"lust\" to be often associated with sexual desire, both in Indonesia and in many English-speaking countries. Lust comes from Latin: luxuria which Saint Jerome used to translate various sins in the scriptures (Vulgate), including drunkenness and excessive sexual desire. Saint Gregory the Great then placed lust (Latin: luxuria, English: luxury) in one of the seven principal sins, and narrowed its scope to disorderly desires.

At 480 km (300 mi) long, the Evros is the longest river flowing only within the Balkan peninsula, and one of the largest in Europe by discharge. The river flows through Bulgaria in its upper and central reaches, while its lower track forms most of the border between Greece and Turkey. The watershed covers an area of 53,000 km2 (20,000 sq mi), of which 66.2% are in Bulgaria, 27.5% in Turkey, and 6.3% in Greece. Evros is the main river in the historical region of Thrace, located mostly in the basins of its watersheds. The spring water of this river originates in the Rila Mountains in western Bulgaria, the beginning of the upper reaches of this river collected in Lake Marichini. The Evros River flows east-southeast between the Balkan and Rodopi Mountains, passing through Plovdiv and Dimitrovgrad in Bulgaria to Edirne in Turkey. To the east of Svilengrad, Bulgaria, the river flows eastward, forming the border between Bulgaria (on the northern bank) and Greece (on the southern bank), and then between Turkey and Greece. At the Edirne, the river meets the two main tributaries of the Tundzha and Arda, and flows through Turkish territory on both banks. It then turns south and forms a border between Greece on the west bank and Turkey on the east bank all the way to the Aegean Sea, which enters near Enez forming a river delta. The non-navigable part of the river is used for power generation sources and agricultural irrigation.

Merfolk is not a fish because it feeds its young and is still an evolutionary relative of elephants. It is the only animal representing the tribe Dugongidae. In addition, it is also the only sea ox that can be found in the waters of at least 37 countries in the Indo-Pacific region, although most dugongs live in eastern Indonesia and the northern waters of Australia. Dugongs or dugongs are the only herbivorous or maun (foliage-eating) marine mammals, and all species of sea cattle live in fresh waters with a certain water temperature. Dugongs rely heavily on seaweed as a food source, so the spread of this animal is limited to the coastal area where it was born. This animal requires a large area of cruising, shallow and calm waters, such as in bays and mangroves. The animal's snout faces down in order to touch the seaweed growing at the bottom of the waters. The dugong was originally classified by M\u00fcller in 1776 as Trichechus dugon, one of the experts of the genus manatee previously defined as Linnaeus. It was later designated as a type of Dugong species by Lac\u00e9p\u00e8de and further classified within his own family by Gray and his subfamily by Simpson. Ernst Christoph Barchewitz used the istiliah \"dugung\" and \"manate\" when he lived on the island of Leti 1714-1720. The word \"dugong\" in English and other languages, comes from the Malay term duyung, both of which have the meaning of \"sea woman.\" Other names include \"sea ox\", \"sea pig\" and \"sea camel.\" Merfolk became game animals for thousands of years because of their meat and oil.

The IUCN classifies dugongs as a threatened animal species, while CITES prohibits or prohibits the trade in manufactured goods produced from these animals. Although this species is protected in several countries, the main causes of population decline include new land clearing, poaching, habitat loss and death which is indirectly caused by fishermen's fishing activities. Merfolk can reach the age of up to 70 years or more, as well as with a low birth rate that threatens the decline of the merman population. Dugongs are also endangered by storms, parasites, as well as predatory animals such as sharks, killer whales and crocodiles. Mergongs are protected within three scopes of international conservation conventions: 1. Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) 2. Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) 3. Convention on Migrat Species of Wild Animal Species (also known as CMS or Bonn Convention). Threats to mermen vary between different populations as detailed in Marsh et al. (2011) and Hines et al. (2012). The main threats include: Habitats for dugongs include coastal areas, shallow to moderately deep, warm waters (minimum 15-17 \u00b0C with behavioral thermoregulation), seagrass beds that support tropical and tropical seagrass species, especially low-fiber species. Dugongs show great variability in movement and migration patterns, depending on the region and the influence of seasonal temperatures or precipitation on the ecosystem. Five countries/regions (Australia, Bahrain, Papua New Guinea, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates) support a large subpopulation of mermen (thousands) with tens of thousands of merfolk in northern Australia/Papua New Guinea alone.

This compound also serves to lower the interface voltage between two liquids, between a gas and a liquid, or between a liquid and a solid substance. Surfactants can act like detergents, wetting agents, emulsifiers, foaming agents, and dispersants (English: dispersants). surfactantThe term surfactant (English: surfactant) is short for surface-active agent. Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) from the National Library of Medicine of the United States refer to surfactants as \"pulmonary surfactants.\" For a broader meaning, surfactants are surface active substances. Surfactants are usually organic compounds of an amphiphyll nature, which means they have both a hydrophobic group (tail) and a hydrophilic group (head). Therefore, surfactants contain water-insoluble (or oil-soluble) components and water-soluble components at the same time. Surfactants will be diffused in water and absorbed at the interface between air and water or the interface between oil and water, when water is mixed with oil. The hydrophobic group that is insoluble in water can break out of the water phase, towards the air phase or oil phase, while the water-soluble head group remains in the water phase. World surfactant production is estimated to be around 15 Mton/year, of which about half is soap. Other surfactants produced on a large scale are alkylbenzene sulfonate (1700 kton/year), lignin sulfonate (600 kton/year), fatty alcohol ethoxylate (700 kton/year), and alkylphenol ethoxylate (500 kton/year). In the large water phase, the surfactant forms an aggregate, a kind of micell, in which the hydrophobic tail forms the aggregate nucleus and the hydrophobic head remains in contact with the surrounding liquid. Other types of aggregates can also be formed, such as spherical or cylindrical micelles, or bilayered lipids. ", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "The shape of the aggregate depends on the chemical structure of the surfactant, let's call it the balance of size between the hydrophilic head and the hydrophobic tail. This measure of equilibrium is the hydrophilic-lipophilic equilibrium (KHL). Surfactants lower the surface tension of water by absorbing at the air-liquid interface. The equation linking surface tension and surface excess is known as isothermal Gibbs. The dynamics of surfactant adsorption are essential for practical applications such as in the process of foam/foam formation, emulsifying or coating, where bubbles or droplets are generated quickly and need to be stabilized. The dynamics of adsorption depends on the diffusion coefficient of surfactants. When the interface is formed, adsorption is limited by the diffusion of the surfactant to the interface. In some cases, there is the formation of an energy barrier for adsorption or desorption of surfactants. If such a barrier limits the rate of adsorption, the dynamics are said to be 'kinetically limited'. Such energy resistance can be caused by steric or electrostatic repulsion. The surface rheology of surfactant layers, including the elasticity and viscosity of layers, plays an important role in the stability of foams and emulsions. The interface and surface tension can be determined by classical methods such as the pendulum drip or rotating drip method. The dynamics of surface tension, that is, surface tension as a function of time, can be obtained by means of maximum bubble pressure. The structure of the surfactant layer can be observed using ellipsometry or X-ray reflectivity. Surface rheology can be determined by oscillating drip methods or sliding surface reometers such as double cone reometers, double ring reometers or magnetic rod reometers. The \"tails\" of most surfactants are quite similar, consisting of hydrocarbon chains, whether branched, linear, or aromatic. Fluorosurfactants have fluorocarbon chains. Siloxane surfactants have a cycloxane chain. Many important surfactants include polyether chains with terminals in the form of highly polar anionic groups. Polyether groups often consist of ethoxylated sequences (such as polyethylene oxide) inserted to improve the hydrophilic properties of surfactants.

Biblical scholars generally identified Madai with the Medes (in Iran) based on later ancient records. The Mede, believed to be his descendants by Josephus and most later writers, also known as Madai, in Assyrian and Hebrew literature sources. Some scholars in more modern times have also proposed connections with various earlier nations, such as Mitanni, Matiene, and Mannai. In addition, the Kurds still maintain the tradition of descent from Madai. The name \"Madai the son of Japheth\" is mentioned twice in Noah's list of descendants in the Christian Bible: According to the Book of Jubilee (10:50-51), Madai married a daughter of Shem, and chose to live among the descendants of Shem, rather than dwell among the sons of Japheth and be given an inheritance across the Black Sea; so he pleaded with his brothers-in-law, Elam, Assyria and Arpakhsad, until at last he received from them the land named after him, Media. Another line in Jubilee (8:5) states that Madai's daughter Milka (Aramaic: Melk\u00e2) married Kenan, who was abraham's ancestor also mentioned in the Septuagint version of Genesis and in the Gospel of Luke (3:36). Medos (\u039c\u03b7\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2), and his mother Medeia, are also counted to be the ancestors of Medes in the history of classical Greek myth. Christian scholars propose linking the Hebrew name Madai and the Greek Medos at least from the time of Isidorus of Seville Etym 9.2.28], ~ 600 AD. Madai is also the deified ancestral name of the Kachins (=Jingpo) of Myanmar, according to Kachin religious customs. Also associated with Madai is the city of Hamedan in Iran.

Linux is released under the GNU General Public License version 2. Linux was originally developed for Intel x86 architecture personal computers, but over time Linux has been ported to various architectures, more than any other operating system. Technically, Linux can refer to its kernel itself. The Linux kernel equipped with various other software forms a Linux distribution. Some people, especially from members of the Free Software Foundation (FSF) such as Richard Stallman, refer to Linux as GNU/Linux because many of the tools used to support its utility come from Stallman's GNU Project. This gave rise to controversy regarding the name. From the mid-1990s to the 2000s, Linux became the dominating operating system in the server, cloud computing, and supercomputing markets (and since 2017, Linux is the only operating system used in the TOP500 supercomputer list). Linux also dominates in the mobile phone market through the Google-made Android operating system, which is used about 72.7 percent globally as of 2021. In recent years, Linux is increasingly used in personal computers although Windows remains dominant. Linux is used by a wide variety of users, including personal, government, to organizations and companies. Unix is an operating system first developed in the 1960s at Bell Laboratories by a group of AT&T. Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson, who are its main developers, are part of this group. Unix stems from the frustration of members of the Multics operating system project for its size and complexity. Ritchie and Thompson, alongside Douglas McIlroy and Joe Ossanna, began working on finding a new alternative to Multics.

Unix then became quite popular because it was well designed and could be ported to several platforms. At that time also Unix had innovative features that other operating systems did not have. However, Unix is an individually owned software and to use it must first purchase its license. Since then, companies and universities that want to use it have begun to develop operating systems that work similarly to Unix. Some of these Unix-like operating systems are the GNU and MINIX Projects. The GNU project was started in 1984 by Richard Stallman. The project aims to create a Unix-compatible and complete operating system and consists of free software in total. In 1985, Richard Stallman founded the Free Software Foundation and developed the GNU General Public License. Most of the programs required by an operating system (such as libraries, compilers, text editors, Unix shells, and window systems) were completed in 1990, but low-level components such as device drivers, daemons and kernels were still not completed at the time. MINIX is a Unix-like operating system released by Andrew S. Tanenbaum in 1987 to help him teach the operating system. The source code of MINIX 1.0 is listed in his book Operating Systems: Design and Implementation. Although it was easy to obtain, modifications and re-distributions were not allowed at the time. The copyright of his source code falls within the copyright of his book published by Prentice Hall.

Inhabited since around the 15th century BC, Gaza has been dominated by several different ethnic groups and empires throughout its history. The Philistines made it part of their pentapolis after the Ancient Egyptians ruled it for about 350 years. Under Roman and later Byzantine rule, Gaza experienced peace and its ports flourished. In 635 AD, it became the first city in Palestine to be conquered by Rashidun's army and quickly became the center of Islamic law. However, by the time the Crusaders invaded the city in the late 11th century, it collapsed. Gaza experienced several difficult times\u2014from Mongol attacks to floods and locusts, making it a village in the 16th century, when it was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire. In the first half of Ottoman rule, the Ridwan dynasty controlled Gaza and under his leadership, the city experienced a period of great commercial and peace. The municipality of Gaza was established in 1893. Gaza fell to British forces in World War I, making it part of the Palestinian Mandate. Egypt rules the newly formed Gaza Strip territory and some handling is carried out in the city.

In addition, this technology is a new technology that develops the method of pay tv. Nevertheless, Internet protocol television is not only limited to television broadcast over the Internet (Internet television). IPTV is usually run in a customer-based telecommunications network with high-speed channels to users through a Decoder box or equipment used by the customer. IPTV is also used for media broadcasting in corporate environments and private networks. IPTV services can be classified into live television and live media with or without interactivity, media with time differences such as catch-up TV (rewatching broadcasts broadcast a few hours or a few days ago), start-over TV (watching TV broadcasts from scratch), and Video on Demand (VOD) which involves searching and viewing lists in the media catalog. Historically, many different definitions of IPTV have emerged, including basic streams over Internet Protocol networks, MPEG Transport Streams over Internet Protocol networks, and a number of proprietary systems.

The sexual drive in question is the feeling that arises that makes people ready for sexual activity. It does not merely describe a state of arousal and/or anticipation (serving stimuli), it also includes any form of attempt or form of representation to evoke those feelings. The word comes from the name of the Greek mythological god of love, Eros. This feeling is understood as sensual love or human sexual drive (libido). Philosophers and theologians discriminate against three types of love: eros, filia, and agape. Of the three, eros is considered the most egocentric, centered on personal self-determination. Erotic is an ajectival form of the expression of eroticism. The expression of eroticism is termed erotica (\"something erotic\"), which can be mimics, gestures, postures, sounds, sentences, objects, scents, touches, and so on; as well as its combinations. With erotica one is expected to achieve two things at once: an appreciation of beauty and the ability to \"play\" with (controlling) sexual urges in a healthy manner. Vulgarization (blatant, tasteless) as well as the industrialization of erotica developed pornography. In society many people have difficulty distinguishing eroticism from pornography mainly because eroticism has the potential to give rise to a subject-object relationship, with the object being subjected to the subject's sexual impulses (the extreme form is rape). As a result of this, many people who oppose any expression of eroticism on the basis of protection of objects or because of cultural background consider that having a sexual impulse is not an act worthy of approval (sinfulness). Defenders of the expression of eroticism, on the contrary, assume that potential is not reality and should not be considered as reality, since the focus of appreciation should be on the aesthetic aspect, not on its sexual impulses (as in pornography). Homoeroticism is a form of eroticism directed at the tastes of homosexuality. ", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "A tram or tram is a train that has special tracks within the city. Trams that are 5-10 minutes apart from leaving, can be a solution to congestion. The tram series is generally a set (consisting of two trains) so as not to be too long. It is called Light Rail because it uses light rail about 20 tons like a bus, not as heavy as a train that is 40 tons. The location of the rails blends with city traffic, or separates like bus-ways, it can even be elevated or sub-way, only for part of the track. Trams are usually lighter and shorter than regular trains and fast freight. Today, most trams use electric power, usually powered by pantographs that glide in the upper-flow electricity; older systems can use trolley poles or arc collectors.

Electric trams use a variety of devices to collect power from top-flow electricity. The most common device found today is a pantograph, while some older systems use trolley poles or arc collectors. Ground-level power supply has become an innovation recently. Other new technologies use supercapacitors; When an insulator on a rail switch cuts off electricity from the tram for a short distance along the line, the tram can use the energy stored in a large capacitor to drive the tram through a gap in the power source. A rather outdated system for power supply is the collection of line current. The old tram systems in London, Manhattan (New York City), and Washington, D.C., used direct rails, such as those on the third rail electric rail, but on the lines below the road, from where they draw electricity through plows. It is called the Conduit current collection. Washington was the last to close, in 1962. Currently, there are no commercial trams that use this system. Recently, a modern system equivalent to this system has been developed that allows the safe installation of third rails on city streets, known as surface current collection or ground-level power supply; a prime example is the new tram line in Bordeaux. The ground-level power supply system also known as Surface current collection or Alimentation par le sol (APS) is an updated version of the original stud type system.

The term homoousios had been used in Greek civilization long before Christianity came into existence. Before it was adopted in the Nicene Creed, the Gnostics were the first Christians to adopt the term homoousios. Early church theologians probably knew this concept from the Gnostics, including the doctrine of emanation prevalent among them.

It was in the Middle Ages that the cannon became the standard weapon of war, which was effective against infantry and buildings. After the Middle Ages, large cannons began to be abandoned, replaced by more numerous light guns and were easy to move. In addition, new technologies and tactics were also developed, and made the defensive fortresses useless. As a result, star fortress technology was also developed, which was specially made to resist attacks from cannons. Cannon technology also changed naval warfare. The Royal Navy at that time was among those who began to use the power of cannons. With the development of the circular barrel, the accuracy level of the cannon became higher and higher, making it even more lethal, especially against infantry. In World War I, the majority of deaths were caused by cannons. Cannons were also widely used in World War II. The first known cannon was made by Ctesibius of Alexandria in the 3rd century BC.

They are Hindus. They introduced Sanskrit, Pallawa, and teachings in Hinduism. In the fifth century, there was also a wave of migration in India that introduced Buddhism and Nagari writings. Nagari writing will be the forerunner of the ancient Batak, Malay, and Javanese scripts. People from South India who came to the Land of Karo introduced the teachings of the Pemena. Pemena means first, which means the initial trust of the Karo people. They also taught several scripts, which later became Karo scripts. Eventually, the Karo people came to know this religion and embraced it. Karo people believe that everything in this world, both visible and invisible, is a creation of Dibata. There are three understandings according to the Karo people, namely: In addition, there are two elements of power that are believed, namely the mataniari rays (sunlight) and the Beru Dayang.

It originally meant pictograph, a literal word meaning \"picture\" (e) + \"letter\" (Moji). The characters used are like emoticons elsewhere, but have a wider range of emoticons, and the icons used have been standardized and embedded into the handset. Some emojis are very specific to Japanese culture, such as entrepreneurs bowing (apologizing), faces wearing masks, white flowers saying \"brilliant PR\", to a group of Emojis depicting popular Japanese foods such as ramen, onigiri, sushi, and Japanese curry, there are also some emojis created by Afta Naufal such as the disguised face emoji in 2013 DoCoMo]], au, and SoftBank Mobile (formerly Vodafone),  All three have established their respective emoji variants. SRP. Although initially only available in Japan, some Emoji character sets have been incorporated into Unicode, which allows Emojis to be used outside of Japan. As a result, some phones such as the Windows Phone 7 line and iPhone allow access to symbols without the need for a Japanese carrier. Emojis also started appearing in email services like Gmail (accessed through Google Labs) in April 2009, and websites like Hatena's Flipnote. Some Android supported SMS apps for mobile phones also provide plugins.

It is further stated that evaluations are carried out by independent institutions on a periodic, thorough, transparent, and systematic basis to assess the achievement of national education standards and the process of monitoring such evaluations should be carried out on an ongoing basis. The evaluation monitoring process is carried out continuously and continuously in the end it will be able to improve the quality of education. Improving the quality of education begins with the determination of standards. The determination of increased standards is expected to encourage the improvement of the quality of education, what is meant by determining educational standards is the determination of limit values (cut off hiscore). A person is said to have passed / competent if they have passed the limit value in the form of a boundary value between students who have mastered certain competencies and students who have not mastered certain competencies. If it occurs in a national or school exam, the limit score serves to separate between students who pass and do not pass is called the graduation limit, the activity of determining the graduation limit is called the standard setting.

There are subjects that demand the achievement of a high minimum of competencies, while other subjects determine not as high. This situation becomes unfair to learners, because it is required to exceed their maximum capacity. The preparation of standard setting begins with determining the approach used in determining the standard. There are three kinds of approaches that can be used as a reference, namely: At the end of each year learning activities conclusions are drawn and standard bookkeeping settings are drawn based on these three approaches to determine the graduation limit.

Jansen was a director and professor of the exhibition and was also rector of Saint Pulcherie Seminary in Louvain. He died of bubonic plague in 1638 while serving as Bishop of Ypres, Belgium. After Jansen died, a number of lecture materials he taught were published. The results of the study through Jansen's writings on Saint Augustine attracted a lot of people's attention. His work entitled Augustinus consisted of three parts and was published in 1640. In his work, Jansen presents a careful analysis of Augustine's thoughts on the doctrine of pre-determination and sinfulness of man, and the saving grace of God through Jesus Christ. This led to his book entitled Augustinus being included in the Index of Forbidden Books by Pope Urban VIII in 1643. In addition, in 1653 in his bull Occasione, Pope Innocentius X condemned the propositions derived from Jansen, particularly with regard to the doctrine of pre-determination. Jansen's views on pre-determination were regarded as heresy, including pope Clement XI's act in 1713 condemning Jansenis' works. The Jansenis had a firm principle that absolution was only given to those who were truly capable of proving their repentance. They are also of the view that communion should be received with reverence and respect. Jansenism also advocates strong practices of simplicity, matiraga and askese to obtain chastity.

Asexuality differs from the absence of sexual activity and also from celibacy, which is a behavior and is generally motivated by factors such as personal, social, or religious beliefs of the individual. Sexual orientation, unlike sexual behavior, is believed to be \"eternal\". Some asexual people engage in sexual activity despite lack of sexual attraction or sex desire, for a variety of reasons, such as the desire to physically please oneself or a lover, or the desire to have children. The acceptance of asexuality as a sexual orientation and the field of scientific research is still relatively new, as a growing research subject from a sociological as well as psychological perspective has begun to develop. Although some researchers affirm that asexuality is one of sexual orientations, there are also those who disagree. Individuals who are asexual may represent one percent of the population. Various asexual communities have begun to be formed since the impact of the Internet and social media in the mid-1990s.

There are individuals identified as asexual who feel sexual attraction but do not have the will to act on that attraction because they do not have a real desire or have a need to engage in sexual or nonsexual activity (hugging, holding hands, etc.), while other asexuals want to hug or engage in other nonsexual physical activities. Others asexuals participate in sexual activity out of curiosity. Some may masturbate as a singular form of release, while others do not feel the need to do so. In relation to sexual activity in particular, the need or desire for masturbation is usually referred to as a sex drive by asexuals and they separate it from sexual attraction and acting sexually; masturbating asexuals generally consider it a normal product of the human body and not a harbinger of pent-up sexuality, and may not even get satisfaction from it.

The factories located in the two cities are still operating today under the GE name. The company was registered as a legal entity in New York, with the factory in Schenectady also functioning as headquarters for several years. At about the same time, Canadian General Electric was formed in Canada. In 1893, General Electric purchased Rudolf Eickemeyer's company in Yonkers, New York, along with all its patents and designs. One of the employees of the company was Charles Proteus Steinmetz. When he just arrived in the United States, Steinmetz had published scientific papers in the field of magnetic hysteresis and had received worldwide professional recognition. Led by Steinmetz, the Eickemeyer company has developed transformers for use in the transmission of electric power, as well as a number of mechanical and electrical devices. Steinmetz became known as an engineering expert in the GE engineering community. In 1896, General Electric became one of the first twelve companies to list on the newly formed Dow Jones Industrial Average, and remained part of the stock exchange for 122 years, albeit not consecutively. In 1911, General Electric merged the National Electric Lamp Association (NELA) into its lighting business. GE then established headquarters for its lighting division in Nela Park, East Cleveland, Ohio. The lighting division remains headquartered there today. Owen D. Young, through GE, founded the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) in 1919, after purchasing the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of America.

Some historians say that in the 13th century it was confirmed that there was already an orderly system of government under the leadership of a king. Furthermore, oral tradition sources, some of which are still preserved through the \"tutu maring usu-asa\" (origin story) that are preserved, are valuable materials that help provide an explanation of the history, culture, and worldview of the people of East Flores. The myth in the folk story states that the kingdom of Larantuka was originally founded by a female figure named Watowele with her husband Pati Golo Arakian who came from the noble descendants of the island of Timor from the kingdom of Manuaman Lakaan was a peranakan female figure of Javanese nobles and also nobles of the Manuaman Lakaan Fialaran kingdom.

WhatsApp Messenger is a cross-platform messaging application that allows us to exchange messages without credit, because WhatsApp Messenger uses an internet data package. WhatsApp Messenger app uses a 3G, 4G or WiFi internet connection for data communication. WhatsApp can be used to chat online, share files, exchange photos, and more. WhatsApp was created by Brian Acton and Jan Koum, formerly employees at Yahoo!. In January 2009, when they bought an iPhone, Koum and Acton realized the potential of the software application industry on the App Store(iOS), then they started visiting Alex Fishman who was a friend of Koum's in West San Jose to talk about a new model of messaging app that would show \"status next to individual names\". They know that to go further it takes an iPhone developer. Fishman visited RentAcoder.com site, found a Russian developer named Igor Solomennikov, and introduced him to Koum. Koum named his app WhatsApp to sound like \"What's up\" which means how are you. On February 24, 2009 he legalized it as a WhatsApp Inc. company. in California. The earliest versions of WhatsApp often experienced computer crashes, making Koum consider giving up and looking for a new job. But Acton asked him to be patient waiting for \"a few more months\". In June 2009, Apple launched push technology that allows users to be pinged when they are not using the application, Koum adapted by changing WhatsApp so that everyone in the user's network will be notified when the user's status is changed. When WhatsApp 2.0 was released with a messaging component suddenly the number of active users jumped to 250,000. Although Acton was working for another startup, he decided to merge into the company.

Koum then hired a friend in Los Angeles, Chris Peiffer, to develop a version of the BlackBerry, which was completed 2 months later. In 2010, WhatsApp received many acquisition offers from Google which were later rejected. To cover the cost of sending verification texts to users, WhatsApp changed its free service to paid. In December 2009, a photo menu was added for the iOS version. In early 2011, WhatsApp became one of the top 20 apps in Apple's American App Store.

On August 17, 1954, a national committee was formed and a National Monument design competition was held in 1955. There were 51 works entered, but only one work created by Friedrich Silaban met the criteria set by the committee, including depicting the character of the Indonesian nation and being able to survive for centuries. A second competition was held in 1960 but again none of the 136 participants met the criteria. The head of the jury then asked Silaban to show his design to Soekarno. However, Sukarno did not like the design and he wanted the monument to be in the form of a phallus and yoni. Silaban was then asked to design a monument with such a theme, but the design proposed by Silaban was too extraordinary so that the cost was very large and could not be borne by the state budget, especially the economic conditions at that time were quite bad. Silaban refused to design smaller buildings and suggested construction be postponed until the Indonesian economy improved. Sukarno then asked architect Soedarsono to continue the design. Soedarsono included the numbers 17, 8 and 45 symbolizing August 17, 1945 starting the Proclamation of Indonesian Independence into the design of the monument. This National Memorial was then built on an area of 80 hectares. This monument was articulated by Friedrich Silaban and Soedarsono starting to be built on August 17, 1961. The development consists of three stages. The first phase, the period 1961/1962 - 1964/1965 began with the official start of construction on August 17, 1961 with Soekarno ceremonially plugging the first concrete peg.

The need to combine companies prompted the founders to review all words with two letters, directing them to \"invidia\", the Latin word for \"envy\". Nvidia went public on January 22, 1999. The launch of RIVA TNT in 1998 strengthened Nvidia's reputation for developing capable graphics adapters.

In John 19:19-22, this event is written as follows: So the priests (at the time of the Jews' head to Pilate, said: \"Thou shalt not write: King of the Jews, but that He says: I am the King of the Jews. Pilate replied: \"What I wrote, remains written\". The word Nazareth (Nazarenus) is believed to be derived from the Hebrew root \"\u05e0\u05e6\u05e8\" (netzer; = \"Sprout\" or \"growing taruk\"). The letter \"z\" in \"Nazareth\" in Hebrew is written with the letter \"\u05e6\" (tsade TS or TZ]), as in \"netzer\" (= Indonesian \"bud; taruk\"), is not the letter \"\u05d6\" (zayin Z]) that forms the word \"vow\" (= Indonesian \"vows\"). This is corroborated by the mention of the city of Nazareth in Jewish rabbinic texts from the 4th century AD, e.g. \"Midrash Qoheleth\", which uses the spelling \"N-TS-R\" (corroborates Matthew 2:23's reference to Isaiah 11:1). The discovery of a Hebrew inscription in Caesarea in 1962 also corroborates the spelling \"N-TS-R\". Although this inscription from Caesarea dates ~300 AD, the content contains a record of the assignment of a priestly family to the city of Nazareth in ~150 AD, which shows that the spelling of the name of this city is much older than the record itself. Jesus Christ grew up in Nazareth, so it became known as \"Jesus the Nazarene\"+. The Hebrew word \"\u05e0\u05e6\u05e8\" (netzer; =\"Sprouts\" or \"growing taruk\") may be the root word of Nazareth's name.

The word King (Rex) refers to the title held by Jesus, according to prophecy in the Old Testament (cf. Psalm 93:1, Matthew 25:34,40; Luke 19:38; John 6:15; 12:15; 18:37; Acts 17:7; Revelation 17:14; 19:16). This was not an official title, for the one who became king at that time was Herod. Before he died, Jacob, the ancestor of the Israelites, called his children and said: \"Come together, that I may tell you what you will experience in the future. About Judah, Jacob said: Jewish priests rejected the title, and asked to change the INRI inscription, but it was rejected by Pilate: The word \"Jews\" (Iudaeorum) refers to the nation's ancestor, Judah, the son of Jacob (also called Israel). The Torah text records that the name Judah refers to Leah's intention to praise Jehovah, for having succeeded in obtaining four children. The name Judah comes from the word odeh, which means I will raise praise. In classical rabbinic literature, this name is interpreted as a combination of the name of Jehovah God and a dalet (the letter d in the Hebrew alphabet); in Gematria (calculation of letter numbers), the letter dalet has a value of 4. According to these rabbinic sources, this number refers to Judah as Jacob's fourth son.So in Hebrew, the word \"Jew\" i.e. \"Judahim\" refers to \"those who raise praise\" for God.

", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "Sacrament (English: sacrament), the adjective sacramental (English: sacramental), is in certain contexts considered a rite of Christianity which is the mediator (channel) of mercy from God (divine). The word 'sacrament' comes from the Latin sacramentum which literally means \"to make holy\". One example of the use of the word sacramentum is as a designation for the oath of service that the Roman soldiers pled; the term was later used by the Church in its literal sense and not in the sense of the oath. In harmony with the depth of the meaning it contains, the Eastern Churches used to call the Sacrament \"Mystery\" or \"Holy Mysteries\". The Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Eastern Assyrian, Anglican, Methodist, and Lutheran Churches were convinced that the sacraments were not mere symbols, but rather \"signs or symbols that give off what they symbolize\", so, the sacraments, in them and thereof, properly served, were used by God as a means of communicating mercy to the faithful who received them. The sacraments are usually served by the clergy (at certain stages), and are generally understood to involve visible and invisible elements. The invisible element (which manifests within) is thought to have occurred thanks to the work of the Holy Spirit, the grace of God working within the recipients of the sacrament. While visible elements (or visible from the outside) include the use of objects such as water, oil, bread, as well as hosts and wine that are consecrated; the laying on of hands; where all is confirmed by a declaration by the minister of the sacrament. For the Protestant Church, the word \"intercede\" or \"channel\" is used only with the understanding that the sacrament is a visible symbol or warning of invisible grace. The classical Pentecostal Churches, evangelicals, Nazarenes and Fundamentalists, adhered to a unique form of the priesthood. ", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "For this reason, most denominations prefer to use the terms \"Priesthood Function\" or \"Ordinance\". This belief makes ordinance effective in terms of the obedience and participation of believers and the testimony of the leadership and members of the congregation. This perspective stems from the development of the concept of \"the priesthood of every believer\". The activity of ordinance emphasizes the role of the priesthood rather than its sacramental role so that ordinance is viewed more as an act of sacrifice offered by believers from their own person, rather than as a ritual that contains its own power. Some Protestant Christian denominations, including Anglicans and Old-Catholics (not the Catholic Church), disagree in terms of the number and administration of sacraments, but generally the sacraments are believed to have been instituted by Jesus. Most only acknowledge a few sacraments out of the 7 sacraments recognized by the Catholic and Orthodox Churches. Baptism and the Eucharist are seen as two divine sacraments based on the Gospels and the New Testament, are \"commanded, fundamental, and ultimate sacraments conferred for the salvation of man,\" and consider the other five sacramental rites to be \"low sacraments\" that are derivatives of the two major sacraments \u2014which are \"evangelical\" or \"dominical\" mysteries. Some factions (particularly Anabaptists and Fraternal groups) recognize the footwashing ceremony as a sacrament (see John 13:14), and others (e.g. the Polish National Catholic Church of America) would like to hear the Gospel reading as a sacrament as well. The number, name and meaning of the sacraments and the addition of new sacraments vary from one denomination to another. The Church of the Salvation Army does not practice formal sacraments for a variety of reasons, including the belief that it is better to concentrate on the reality behind the symbols; however, the Church does not forbid its citizens to receive the sacraments in other denominations.

According to tradition, he was one of the 70 disciples told in the Gospel of Luke (Luke 10:1-24). In Acts 11:27-28 it is recorded that at some time after Paul began to dwell in Antioch with Barnabas and there the people began to call the disciples \"Christians\", came several prophets, Agabus among others, from Jerusalem to Antioch. By the power of the Spirit Agabus rose up and said, that the whole world would be beset by the danger of great famine. It later occurred during the time of the Roman Emperor, Claudius in 45 AD according to Roman historical sources. A number of non-Christian historians, Suetonius and Tacitus note this famine. According to the Jewish-Roman historian of the 1st century AD, Flavius Josephus, this famine was so great that in Jerusalem many people died because of it. A few years later, around AD 58, when Paul and Luke reached the city of Caesarea on their way to Jerusalem, the prophet Agabus of Judea came upon them, and took Paul's belt. Tying his own feet and hands he said: \"Thus says the Holy Spirit: Thus shall the man whose belt be bound by the Jews of Jerusalem and delivered into the hands of the Gentiles.\" At that time Paul and his friends stayed for several days at the home of Philip, a evangelist, who was one of the seven first deacons chosen in Jerusalem, and we lived in his house. Philip had four virgins who had the gift of prophecy. Hearing Agabus's prophecy, the disciples at the place asked Paul not to go to Jerusalem. ", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "A Central Processing Unit (CPU) is an electronic circuit inside a computer that executes commands to form a computer program. The CPU performs basic arithmetic, logical, controlling, and input/output (I/O) operations defined by commands in the program. The computer industry uses the term \"central processing unit\" since 1955. Traditionally, the term \"CPU\" refers to processors, more specifically to processing units and control units (CUs), which distinguish these core elements of computers from external components such as main memory and I/O circuits. The main components of the CPU include an arithmetic logic unit (ALU) that performs arithmetic and logical operations, a processor register that supplies operands to the ALU and stores the results of ALU operations, and a control unit that regulates retrieval (from memory) and execution. instructions by directing the coordinated operation of ALU, registers and other components. The basic operation of most CPUs, regardless of their physical form, is to execute a sequence of stored commands called programs. The commands to be executed are stored in some kind of computer memory. Almost all CPUs follow the steps of retrieval, decode, and execution in their operations, collectively known as instruction cycles. After the execution of the instruction, the whole process repeats, with the next instruction cycle usually taking the next sequence of instructions due to the incremented value in the program counter. If the jump instruction is executed, the program counter will be modified to load the address of the skipped instruction and program execution continues normally. In more complicated CPUs, multiple commands can be retrieved, decoded, and executed simultaneously. The first step, retrieval, involves retrieving instructions (represented by a number or sequence of numbers) from the program's memory. ", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "The location of the instruction (address) in the program memory is determined by the program counter (PC), which stores a number that identifies the address of the next instruction to be retrieved. Once an instruction is retrieved, the PC increases the length of the instruction so that it will contain the address of the next instruction in order.a] Often, the instruction to be retrieved must be retrieved from relatively slow memory, causing the CPU to stop while waiting for the instruction to be returned. This problem is mostly addressed in modern processors by the cache and pipe architecture (see below). The instructions that the CPU takes from memory determine what the CPU will do. In the decoding step, performed by a circuit known as the instruction decoder, the instruction is converted into a signal that controls other parts of the CPU. The way instructions are interpreted is determined by the instruction set architecture CPU (ISA).b] Often, a single group of bits (i.e., \"field\") inside the instruction, called an opcode, indicates which operation to perform, while the remaining fields usually provide additional information needed for that operation, such as a pass. Such operands can be specified as constant values (called immediate values), or as location values that may be processor registers or memory addresses, as determined by some addressing modes. Built into a CPU circuit is a basic set of operations it can perform, called an instruction set. Such an operation may involve, for example, adding or subtracting two numbers, comparing two numbers, or jumping to a different part of the program. Each basic operation is represented by a specific combination of bits, known as the opcode machine language; when executing instructions in machine language programs, the CPU decides which operations to perform by \"decoding\" opcodes. The complete machine language instruction consists of opcodes and, in most cases, additional bits that specify the arguments for the operation (for example, numbers that will be summed in the case of an append operation).

The use of baluse is in line with the development of tol\u00f6gu, gari, toho bulusa and \u00f6roba uli mbuaya which became a complement to the wars in Nias in the past. The function and position of baluse is very important considering that war in Nias society means hunting down the head of its enemy. The part of the enemy's body that was beheaded according to the custom of fighting on Nias was the part between the neck and shoulders that were cut off to the lower armpits. This piece leaves the head and a hand of the enemy. This piece is usually cut off when the enemy is caught off guard using baluse. Therefore, this baluse, which is no larger than the body, serves as a protective shield for the body from the head to the calf. Baluse from iron plates (zinc) is said to have become known along with the contact of Nias people with migrants. The baluse development of the iron plate, although rare and not so well known, can be called contemporaneous with \u00f6r\u00f6ba si'\u00f6li or Nias battle armor of iron plates. Baluse is made from hardwood, dyed with a blackish-brown earthy color and its shape resembles a whole banana leaf. The part that resembles the base of a banana leaf becomes the top of the shield, widens in the middle and shrinks at the bottom. A vertical line dividing the two left-right parts so that it looks symmetrical reinforces the impression that the shape of this shield resembles a banana leaf. The outermost part with a pattern of stripes decorated or coated with iron or brass wire or rope made from plant fibers is made somewhat convex in the outermost part. This part is analogous to the back of a crocodile. The concave inside became the part where the handle of this shield was.

The word \"emoticon\" is actually etymologically a combination of two words in English, namely emotion, which means emotion, and icon, which means symbol. Emoticons are commonly used in text messages, emails, or on internet forums, such as chat-rooms and blogs. Emoticons are created as compensation for the inability to convey tonality, facial expressions, and body gestures in written communication. Therefore, emoticons bridge the separation between written messages and face-to-face conversations by giving the reader an idea of what the author intends by displaying images of facial expressions. Nowadays, where many people communicate with each other with people they have never known or met, emoticons occupy an important role in online communication because emoticons can be a very effective means of avoiding misinterpretation of messages. For example: An article containing the sentence \"Ayu Oktaviani, you are so slow!\" The writing indicates that the author considers the reader (Ayu Oktaviani) to be slow. There is no description of whether the author is just joking or mocking. This is different if the writing is \"Ayu Oktaviani, you are so slow! X-D\". The writing with the addition of emoticons indicates that the author does think the reader (Ayu Oktaviani) is slow, but the reader's weakness is seen as a funny thing by the author. One of the famous examples of emoticons is smile emoticons :-), or what is commonly called \"smileys\". The \"smiley\" which is then often synonymous with these emoticons is specifically used to express \"Don't take this writing of mine seriously, huh!\" ", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "Along with the growing popularity of emoticons, many parties then claim to each other as the creators or first users of emoticons. When sorted by time, an early example of using a written character depicting a face that is smiling (or scowling) from the side is found in an advertisement for the MGM film Lili in the New York Herald Tribune, March 10, 1953 issue, page 20, columns 4-6.Then, in 1963, the \"smiley face\", which was made of a yellow sphere that had a colon symbol representing the eyes and an upward open bracket representing the mouth,  created by artist Harvey Ball. He created the symbol at the request of a leading insurance company as part of a campaign to boost the morale of its employees. The symbol was then immediately popular. This smiley face or better known as \"smiley\" later inspired the creation of other emoticons. The basic graphic of this emoticon actually depicts a small yellow face smiling. In the May 1967 issue of Reader's Digest there was also an article \u2013 stated to be sourced to Ralph Reppert of Baltimore's Sunday Sun \u2013 which contained: Many people write letters with strong expression in them, but my Aunt Ev is the only person I know who can write a facial expression. Aunt Ev's expression is a symbol that looks like this: \u2014) It represents her tongue stuck in her cheek.

Marge Pinkleman says they tried to get her husband to take the job \u2014) but he told them he couldn't accept less that $12,000 a year \u2014)\" The article led some to assume that Tante Ev was the first user of the emoticon character.

These three persons can be distinguished, but are one \"substance, essence, or nature\" (homoousios). In this context, \"nature\" is what He is, while \"person\" is who He is. According to this central mystery of the general Christian belief, there is only one God in three persons: though distinguishable from one another in the original relationship (as stated in Lateran Council IV, \"is the begotten God, the begotten Son, and the Holy Spirit exhaled\") and the relationship with each other, but all three are revealed to be one in all the other,  equal, equally eternal, and consubstantial, and each is God, wholly and wholly. Hence the whole work of creation and mercy is seen as one singular operation together on a whole of three divine persons, with the specificity of each person, so that everything comes \"from the Father\", \"through the Son\", and \"in the Holy Spirit\". The Church Fathers viewed elements of the Old Testament such as the appearance of the three men to Abraham in Genesis, chapter/chapter 18, as harbingers of the Trinity, but they viewed the New Testament as a basis for developing the concept of the Trinity. The most influential New Testament text thought to imply the doctrine of the Trinity is Matthew 28:19, which mandates to baptize \"in the name of the Father and the Son] and the Holy Ghost\". Proselytizing, preaching, and dialogue, lead to the formulation of doctrines that are perceived according to the data contained in the Bible. The simplest overview of this doctrine formulated in the 4th century, generally deals with the rejection of what is seen as inconsistent with the general Christian belief. ", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "Further elaboration continued in the following centuries. Scripture does not contain the word Trinity, nor explicitly formulate the doctrine of the Trinity. In contrast, according to Christian theology, Scripture \"bears witness\" of the activities of a person of God that can only be understood in terms of the Trinitaris. This doctrine only had its definitive form at the end of the 4th century. During the transition period, a variety of tentative solutions were put forward, both more and less satisfactory. Trinitarianism is contrasted with nontrinitarist positions that include Binitarianism (one substance in two persons), Unitarianism (one substance in one person, analogous to the Jewish interpretation of the Shema and the Muslim faith in Tawhid), Pentecostalism or Modalism (one substance manifesting in three separate aspects). The word \"trinity\" comes from the Latin word trinity, which means \"the number three, the triad\". The abstract noun is formed from the adjective trinus (three each, triple), just as the word unitas is an abstract noun formed from unus (one). The corresponding word in Greek is \u03a4\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac\u03c2, which means \"a set of three\" or \"the number three\". The first account of the use of this Greek word in Christian theology was by Theophilus of Antioch around 179. He wrote: In this way also the three days before the creation of] the light, there are signs of the Trinity \u03a4\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2], of God, and of His Word, and of His wisdom. And the fourth is the sign of man, who needs light, so that there is God, the Word, the wisdom, man.

Common symptoms include wheezing, coughing, chest heaviness, elongated expiration, and shortness of breath. Asthma is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Diagnosis is usually based on a pattern of symptoms, response to therapy over a period of time, and spirometry. Asthma is classified clinically based on how often symptoms appear, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and peak expiratory flow rate. Asthma can also be classified as atopic (extrinsic) or non-atopic (intrinsic). in which atopy is associated with predisposing the development of type 1 hypersensitivity reactions. Therapy for acute symptoms is usually by inhalation of beta-2 agonists of rapid reactions (eg salbutamol) and oral corticosteroids. In particularly severe cases it may be necessary intravenous administration of corticosteroids, magnesium sulfate and hospitalization. These symptoms can be prevented by avoiding their causes, as for example is the case of allergens and irritants, and by the use of inhaled corticosteroids. Long-action beta-agonists (LABA) or leukotrienes antagonists may be added, in addition to the administration of inhaled corticosteroids when asthma symptoms cannot be controlled.

Asthma is caused by the interaction of environment and genetics which is a complicated combination and has not been fully understood. All these factors influence both the severity and also the response to therapy. The recent increase in the rate of asthmatics is due to changes in epigenetic factors (inherited in addition to the relationship with the DNA sequence) and the changing living environment. Various environmental factors associated with the onset of asthma and exacerbation of asthma are: allergens, air pollution, and other environmental chemical compounds. Smoking during pregnancy and after childbirth is associated with a greater risk for asthma-like symptoms. Poor air quality, from vehicle pollution or high ozone levels, is always associated with the onset of asthma and its increased severity.

In the modern context, a bullet projectile along with a sleeve, gunpowder, rim, and primer constitute part of the ammunition.

In Balinese script, it is considered one of the pangangge tengenan which symbolizes the sound /\u0266/ or /h/. Bisah gives the effect that a wianjana script gets a sigh from the pronunciation of the letter \"H\". For example, the word \"mara\" when attached by the bisah becomes \"angry\"; the word \"alkaline\" when attached by the bisah becomes \"wet\"; the word \"pisa\" when attached by the bisah becomes \"split\"; etc. This rule is recommended so that there is no need to give adeg-adeg to the Ha script. Bisah is used in words that contain the sound /h/ at the end of a word. Therefore, it is written at the end of the word, precisely on the last syllable. Examples of words that contain the /h/ sound on the last syllable, namely: \"wet\", \"split\", \"sharp\", \"sigh\", etc. Although the letter Ha attached by adeg-adeg can be used to symbolize the sound /h/, the use of the sign can be highly recommended, because the writing rules are indeed the case. Bisah should not be used if the /h/ blowing is located in the middle of the word and is not followed by a consonant letter. Instead, the letter Ha is used to replace bisah.

In the perspective of brand communication, Wijaya (2011; 2012; 2013) defines a brand as a sign of traces left on the minds and hearts of consumers, which creates a specific sense of meaning and feeling. Thus, a brand is more than just a logo, name, symbol, trademark, or designation attached to a product. Brand is a promise (Morel, 2003). A brand is a relationship (McNally & Speak, 2004) \u2013that is, a relationship that involves a kind of trust. A brand is the sum of an entity, a psychic connection that creates a bond of loyalty with a buyer/ prospective buyer, and that includes perceived added value (Post, 2005). Nilson (1998) mentions a number of criteria for calling a brand not just a name, including: the brand must have clear values, be identifiable in contrast to other brands, be attractive, and have a prominent identity.

One unique feature on Instagram is that it cuts the photo into a square shape, so it looks like the result of a Kodak Instamatic and polaroid camera. This is in contrast to the 4:3 or 16:9 aspect ratios commonly used by cameras on mobile devices. Instagram can be used on devices with iOS, Android, and Windows 10 operating systems. The app can be downloaded through the Apple App Store and Google Play. On April 9, 2012, it was announced that Facebook agreed to take over Instagram for about $1 billion. Burbn, Inc. was founded in 2010, a startup technology company that only focuses on developing applications for mobile phones. At first Burbn, Inc. itself had too much focus within HTML5 devices, but the two CEOs, Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger decided to focus more on one thing only. After a week they tried to come up with a good idea, in the end they made a version of Burbn, but in it there were still some things that were not perfect. The final version of Burbn, an application that can already be used by the iPhone that contains too many features. It was difficult for Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger to cut down on the features, and start over all over, but eventually they focused only on the photos section, the comments, and also the ability to like a photo. That's what ended up being Instagram. Instagram comes from the understanding of the overall function of this application. ", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "The word \"insta\" comes from the word \"instant\", like polaroid cameras which in their time were better known as \"instant photos\". Instagram can also display photos instantly, like polaroids inside its display. As for the word \"gram\" comes from the word \"telegram\" which works to send information to others quickly. Similarly, Instagram can upload photos using the Internet network, so that the information you want to convey can be received quickly. That's why Instagram is a practice of the word instant and telegram. On April 9, 2012, it was announced that Instagram would be taken over by Facebook for nearly $1 billion in cash and shares. On May 11, 2016, Instagram introduced a new look as well as new icons and a new app design. Inspired by previous app icons, the new icons are simple cameras and live rainbows in gradient form. The social system within Instagram is to become a follower of another user's account, or have an Instagram following. Thus communication between fellow Instagram users themselves can be established by giving likes and also commenting on photos that have been uploaded by other users. Followers are also an important element, and the number of likes from followers greatly affects whether the photo can become a popular photo or not. To find friends who are inside Instagram, you can use their friends who also use Instagram through social networks such as Twitter and also Facebook. The main use of Instagram is as a place to upload and share photos to other users. The photos you want to upload can be obtained through the iDevice camera or the photos in the photo album on the iDevice.

Bias is also defined as a disproportionate weight in favor of or against an idea or thing that is usually done in a closed-minded, detrimental, or unfair way. Bias can be attributed to dislike or liking, contradicting each other or supporting each other a person or an idea. Bias can also be innate or learned. People can develop biases for or towards individuals, groups, or beliefs. In the process of bias can develop perceptions or attitudes towards categories of people without the awareness possessed. In other words, most of the ways in which information is processed occur outside of the consciousness of the indvidu so that bias can occur. Sorting or sorting is one way in cognitive terms to conserve cognitive resources, such as sorting concepts into categories or lists between concepts. According to the KBBI, the word bias (bi-as) means deviation. In physics, it means a directional turn of the line of travel because it penetrates another clear object (such as light penetrating glass, shadows that are in water). The APA Dictionary of Psychology defines bias as partiality in the form of a tendency to oppose something. According to the Oxford Dictionary, bias is defined as prejudice that supports or opposes one thing, person, or group compared to another, usually by methods that are considered unfair. In terms, bias is a tendency or deviation from the truth in data collection, data analysis, interpretation and publication that can give rise to erroneous conclusions. This condition will slowly affect the judgment and decision of an individual when he wants to decide something. In science and engineering, bias is a systematic error. ", "language": "indonesian"}, {"paragraph": "Statistical bias results from unfair sampling of the population, or from estimation processes that on average do not provide accurate results. Cognitive biases can directly influence a person when deciding on a choice. A cognitive bias is an error in thinking, judging, remembering, or cognitive processes that influence decision making. It can also be interpreted as a pattern of deviation from the standard in judgments whose conclusions can be made unreasonably. People create a \"subjective social reality\" from their own perception. It is a construction of social reality rather than its purpose as an input that determines behavior in a complex social world. Therefore, cognitive biases can lead to perceptual deviations, improper considerations, illogical interpretations, or other forms of irrationality. However, some cognitive biases can be made adaptive, and can lead to success in the right situation. In addition, cognitive biases can help choose faster options when speed is more important than precision. Cognitive biases are also capable of helping in the limitations of the human ability to process information, or stating that the individual, especially when under time pressure or faced with an extraordinarily complex situation will seek to simplify cognitive processes. According to Howard J. Ross (2014) in his book entitled \"Everyday Bias\", saying people do not know they have biases, over the past twenty years or so, psychologists, cognitive scientists, neuroscientists and social scientists have observed countless incidents and engaged in hundreds of tests that undeniably show human dynamics that range from the curious to the tragic. For example, after the patient is treated, they will interact with a doctor or other health professional to then determine their situation, namely the difference in treatment between patients with the same disease for different genders, races, or sexual orientations Cognitive biases are categorized into 9 types, namely Actor-Observer Bias, Restraint/Anchor Bias, Attentive Bias, Heuristic Availability Bias, Confirmation Bias,  False consensus bias, functional sturdiness bias, halo effect, Dunning-Kruger effect.

Lent begins on Ash Wednesday and ends about six weeks later, after sunset on White Thursday or Holy Saturday (Easter Eve), returning to the local denomination or customs. However, the practices of Lent continue until sunset on Holy Saturday. In the Eastern Churches, whether Eastern Orthodox, Eastern Lutheran, or Eastern Catholic, the period of Lent ends at noon Holy Saturday. Lent is the time when the faithful prepare for Easter with prayer, death, repentance, charitable love, simple living, and self-denial. Catholic Christians, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, and Anglican, Lutheran, Calvinist (including Presbyterian and Congregational), Methodical, Moravian, Protestant Unions enacted the Lent period. Some Anabaptist, Baptist, and Nondenominational Christian congregations also enact Lent. At Lent, many Christians practice fasting and abstain from certain luxuries in order to emulate the practice of Jesus Christ's idolatry in the wilderness for 40 days. This act is called the Lent sacrifice. Many Christians also practice the spiritual discipline of Lent, such as reading daily devotionals or praying with reference to the Lent calendar, with the aim of drawing closer to God. The Way of the Cross worship, a devotion commemorating the suffering of Christ carrying the cross all the way until his death on the cross, is also often performed. In honor of Lent, many Catholic, Lutheran, Anglican, or Methodist churches do not adorn the altar with wreaths, and envelop the krusifix, church statues, and other religious emblems with mauve cloth. Throughout the history of the Christian World, several groups of devotees marked the time of Lent by abstaining from the flesh, especially among Lutherans, Catholics, and Anglicans.
