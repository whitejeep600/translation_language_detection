The Christians of mortalism also embraced the understanding of anihilationism, the belief that after the last trial, the wicked would disappear, not endure eternal torment. Jehovah's Witnesses share a similar view. The holiday of Christianity was established on the basis of astronomy. Two of them are Christmas and Easter. Easter was celebrated the first week when the full moon passed. This condition was achieved when the eukinoks of spring. Whereas Christmas was celebrated on the first day of the turning point of the sunrise in winter again in the opposite direction in view of the sky. In his writing, the First Defense (ca. 150 C.E.), Justin Martyr describes the course of Christian liturgy in his explanation of the Christian religion to Emperor Antoninus Pius. This image is still relevant to the basic order of Christian worship. Justin Martyr gave this description: And on a Sunday, all who lived in cities and villages met together in one place, and in the history of the apostles or the writings of the prophets were read, all the time permissible; then when the reader had completed his duty, the leader of worship gave speech, and encouraged these good things to be recited. Then we all stood together and prayed, and as we had said before, when we had prayed, and bread and wine and water were delivered, and the elders offered prayers and words of thanksgiving, according to their ability, and the audience said, \"Amen,\" and there was a part of it, and it was offered to all the people, and there was no portion brought to them.\"",

It is known from Justin Martyr's writings that, in his lifetime, Christians meet to worship in a congregation on Sunday, the day of Jesus ' resurrection, despite other religious ceremonies performed outside Sunday. The Bible's readings are from the Old Testament and the New Testament, especially the Bible. Often these readings are arranged to follow an annual cycle, in a book called lexionarian. The oral direction of the leader of worship is based on these readings, and it's called sermons or homily. There are various prayers of thanksgiving, confessions, and intercession. He is the Hearer, the Knower. The Lord's Prayer, or the Lord's Prayer, is uttered regularly. Some Christian denominations have left behind this traditional religious arrangement. In English-speaking countries, people often distinguish the services of worship into \"higher\" church services, which are characterized by more grander, more public ceremonies, and \"lower\" church services, but in these two categories too there are a wide variety of forms of worship. The Seventh Day Adventist Church held congregation worship on Saturday, and there were also Christian churches who held regular worship (a week).",

Denominations that do not recognize the existence of separate priesthoods of laymen in general worship without having to be guided by an official leader of worship, either because of the principles held by the denomination, or because of simply adjusting the arrangement of worship to the needs of the local congregation. Some denominations use only acapela music, either because of the principles it contains (for example, many from the denomination of Christ's Congregation rejected the use of musical instruments in worship), as well as the tradition (as in the Orthodox Church). Almost all Christian denominations hold the Eucharist celebration ceremony, which is the blessing ceremony and the distribution of bread and wine. This ceremony was performed in obedience to Jesus ' command at the Last Supper to his disciples to be made to remember himself when he gave them bread, and said, \"This is my body,\" and passed the cup of wine, saying, \"This is my blood.\" Some Christian denominations practice closed communications, so they only share communion (blessed bread and wine) with those who have joined their denominations, or sometimes only to those who have joined their church. The Catholic Church only shares communism with its members who are not in a state of grave sin. Most denominations practice open communication, for their view of communion is the means of alliance, and not the alliance itself.",

In many churches today, children are separated from adults throughout the whole or part of the worship time to be taught according to their age. Special worship for this child is called Sunday school or Sabbath school (Sunday School is often held before worship, rather than during worship). Justin Martyr in the scope of Christian faith and practice, the sacrament is a rite instituted by Christ into a channel of divine grace, and is a sacred mystery. The term \"sacrement\" comes from the Latin word, the sacrementum, which is a equivalent to the Greek word, Christian denominations differ in view regarding which rituals can be called sacraments, and any action necessary for the splendour of a sacrament. The most common functional definition of the sacrament is a external sign that Christ established as a channel of inner spiritual love by means of Christ. The two most acceptable sacraments are the baptismal sacraments and the Eucharist. Nevertheless, the majority of Christians also acknowledge the five other sacraments of Sacracy (called Krisma among Orthodox Christians), the sacrament of Leviticus (dedication), the sacrilege of the Penalty, the Sacrament of Condemnation, and the Sacracies of Marriage. If put together, these sacraments are the Seventh Sacrament recognized by the Churches of the High Church, especially the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Orthodox Church, the Independent Catholic Churches, the Old Catholic Churches, many Anglican churches, and a number of Lutheran churches.",

Each period of the liturgy highlights certain theological themes and certain customs of worship that are shown in various ways to decorate churches, paramentum colors and vestimentum for ministers, nas-nas which are read in worship, sermons, and even on various traditions and practices for members of the congregation in person or where they live. Christian liturgy dating in the Western World was arranged to follow the annual cycle of Roman rites in the Catholic Church, while the Eastern Christians used similar dates arranged to follow the annual cycle of their respective Church rites.

There are also a few Christian denominations that do not use the liturgy date at all. In general, Christianity did not practice aniconism, namely, rejection or ban on the use of various images, although some Jewish Christian sects and a number of modern Christian denominations were to some extent more inclined not to use the images of living beings as symbols for the reasons of obedience to idolatry in Dasatitah. The cross, one of the most familiar symbols in the world today, is used as one of the symbols of Christianity since the beginning of the history of the Church. In his writings entitled De Corona (The Crown Hall), Tertullian expressed that it was a tradition for Christians to mark their foreheads repeatedly with the sign of the cross. Although the symbol of the cross was well - known to the first Christians, it was not until the 5th century that the crewifices (a cross in Jesus ' image) began to be used. Among the various symbols used by first - century Christians, the symbol of fish seems to occupy the most important position.

This abbreviated phrase of the word iktys is an attack on the short Greek word but clearly describes Christ's fitrah as the one that the believers worship, Iesous Kristos Ios Soter, meaning Jesus Christ, the Son of God, Savior. Other principal symbols of Christianity include ki-ro monogramms, doves, sacrificial lambs, wine subjects (the need for Christians to be constantly connected to Christ), and various other symbols. All these symbols belong to the verses of the New Testament. Baptism is an act of ritual, using water, to legalize a person as a member of the Church. Christian denominations differ in belief regarding baptism. The first is related to the issue of whether baptism has an important spiritual meaning. Some denominations, such as the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, as well as a number of Lutheran and Anglican churches, embraced the doctrine of baptism for rebirth, confirming that baptism fosters or confirms one's faith, and is closely related to salvation. Other denominations think that baptism is simply a symbolic act, which is a public statement about the inner change that has taken place in a person, but does not contain spiritual properties. The second is related to the application of baptism. One can be baptized in a form of imersi (dip), submersion (salm), afusion (guyur), and aspersi (sip). Denominations that believe that baptism contains spiritual properties generally apply to the tradition of infant baptism.

In various verses of the New Testament, the freedom to draw close to God is also highlighted (Filips 4:6, James 5:13:19). Such confidence must be understood in the scope of Christian confidence in the special relationship between a believer and Christ through the Holy Spirit that resides within him. In the traditions of Christianity in later times, certain gestures were highlighted, including medieval gestures such as kneeling or making a sign of the cross. Kneeling, prostrating, and prostrating (see also a colon) are often practiced by more traditional Christian denominations. Christians in the Western World often prayed as they closed their palms with their fingertips pointed forward as in a feudal recommendation ceremony. It's also sometimes used a much more ancient form of prayer, which is to lift the two hands together with the palms of their hands facing forward, the tips of their fingers pointing upward, and the elbows bent. A prayer of intercession is to pray in behalf of others. There are many historys of intercession in the Scriptures, among which the apostle Peter's intercession for the healing of the sick (The Apostles 9:40) and the intercession of the prophets in the Old Testament in behalf of others (1 Kings 17:19 JULY22).

The ancient Church, which included both the Eastern Church and the Western Church, developed the tradition of praying for the saints ' intercession. To this day this tradition is still practiced in the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Oriental Orthodox Church, the Catholic Church, and a number of Anglican churches. Nevertheless, churches formed in the days of the Protestant Reformation rejected the tradition of praying to the saints, on the basis that Christ was the only intermediary for mankind. The Protestant Reformer Hulderikus Zwingli once claimed to pray to the saints until it was finally convinced by the Biblical nas that such acts were idolatry. According to the Catholic catechism, \"praying is to direct your mind and heart to God or ask God for good things.\" The Common Prayer Book used among Anglicans is a church prayer guide that contains prayers, Bible readings, and a group of madahs or psalms to sing. The Christian agam began as a Jewish religious sect in the region of Shamm, the Middle East, in the middle of the first century of the Common Era. In addition to the Jewish religion of the second half-decent, the great beliefs that contributed to Christianity's original Christianity were the Magi and the teachings of Gnostic.note 2) John Bowker argued that the notions of Christians such as \"angels, the apocalypse, the final courts, the resurrections, and the resurrections and hells gained the form and meaning of... the beliefs of the advanced religion.\" Christianity first grew under the leadership of the twelve apostles, especially Peter and Paul, followed by the first bishops 5] honored by Christians as successors to the apostles.

According to church tradition, during the persecution of Emperor Nero these were the leaders of the Prime Church, Peter and Paul, who died as martyrs in Rome. Even greater persecutions took place during the reign of the nine Roman Emperors, and the most frequent during the reign of Emperor Desius and Emperor Dioclesian. Since the 150th year, Christian scholars have begun to produce works of theology and apology to defend the Christian faith. These poets are known as fathers of the Church, and studies of their works are called Patristic or Patrological Studies. The well - known fathers of the former Church include Ignasius of Antioch, Polycarpus, Justin Martyr, Ireeus, Tertullian, Clement of Alexandria, and Origen. Armenia is believed to be the first country to accept Christianity, when King Tirdat III made Christianity the religion of the Armenian state between 301 and 314. Christianity was not a new religion in Armenia at the time, because it had spread to the country as slowly as it had been since the 3rd century, and it was probably early again. Oppression by the state subsided in the 4th century, after Constantine I issued an pronouncement of tolerance in 313. At the time, Christians were still a minority class, perhaps only five percent of the Roman population.

By the beginning of the 10th century, Christian monasticism in the Western World was growing because of the efforts of reforms that were pioneered by the Benediktin mother convent in Cluny. Hebraism, like Hellenism, is one of the most important factors in the development of Western civilization; Jewish religion, as the predecessors of Christian religion, has in no way contributed much to the formation of the high values and eclipse of Western nations since Christianity spread far and wide on the mainland of Europe. Since the 11th century, long - standing cathedral schools in the Western World have been developed into universities (see Oxford University, Paris University, and Bologna University). These traditional Middle Ages universities considered the development of Catholic and Protestant Church schools to form special academic structures to educate more deserving students in order to become professional forces. Professor Walter R\u00fcegg, editor of the book A History of the University in Europe, suggested that the universities of those days only educated students to become ministers, legal experts, prajas, and physicians. Although initially only taught theology courses, universities began to add other college spies, such as medicine, philosophy, and law. The universities that teach these additional subjects became the precursor of modern higher education institutions.

The Crusades finally failed to stem from Islam's aggression, even causing a sense of hostility among the Christians themselves after the city of Constantinople was plundered by Christian armies from Western Europe during the 4th Crusade. From the 7th to the 13th century, Christians in the Western World and Christians in the Eastern World were gradually isolated from one another.

Nevertheless, the Catholic Church has been able to restore unity with a number of smaller Eastern Churches. Starting about 1184, after the Crusade against heresy of Katarism, various judicial institutions, commonly called the Inquisition, were formed with the goal of eliminating heresy and maintaining the unity of Christianity through religious conversions and lawsuits. The spirit of reform in the 15th century revived people's interest in ancient science. Another great skisma, the Protestant Reformation, splits the Christians in the Western World into streams. In 1517, Martin Luther protested the sale of indulgences (received the removal of sin) and soon began to establish a number of key points in the doctrine of the Catholic Church. Other Protestant Reformers such as Hulderikus Zwingli, John Oecolampadius, John Kalvin, John Knox, and James Arminius went further in denouncing Catholic teachings and worship. These oppositions to the Catholic Church developed into a movement called Protestantism that prefaced the Pope, the role of Sacred Tradition, Seven Sacraments, and other doctrines and practices. The Protestant Reformation movement in England began in 1534, when King Henry VIII was proclaimed Head of the Church of England.

During the centuries that followed, the rivalry between Catholic Christianity and Protestant Christianity was mixed with the political struggles of European countries. Meanwhile, the discovery of America by Kristoforus Kolanbus in 1492 generated a new wave of activity. Thanks to this new spirit for preaching, although in line with the expansion of countries in Europe, Christianity spread to America, Oceania, East Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa. Throughout Europe, the disunity that was caused by the Protestant Reformation took place in the proliferation of religious violence and the formation of self-conceived churches. Lutheran streams spread to northern, central, and eastern regions of Germany, Livonia, and Scandinavia. Anglican stream formed in England in 1534. The flow of Kalvinis and its various fractions (e.g. Presbyterian Flow) spread in Scotland, the Netherlands, Hungary, Switzerland, and France. Alitan Arminian found followers in Holland and Frisia. These differences ultimately led to issues that were triggered by religious issues. The Thirty Years ' War, the British Civil War, and the French Religion War are the most outstanding examples. These events heat up debates among Christians about persuasion and tolerance.

Variables in this competition are the size of the nisbi of the denominations and religious orientation, politics and ideology of the country. Urs Altermatt of the University of Fribourg, who took a special look at Catholic Christianity in Europe, managed to identify four different forms of human life in Europe. In countries where the majority of its citizens have embraced Catholic Christianity, such as Belgium, Spain, and to some extent Austria, religious and national communities are more or less identical. Symbiosis and cultural separation have been found in Poland, Ireland, and Switzerland, which is countries with competing denominations. Competition has been found in Germany, the Netherlands, as well as in Switzerland, which is a minority Catholic population that is more or less proud to be the nation's son of a country that he lives in.

The ban on communism and the anti-confusionism policies issued by the New Order regime led people (most of them Chinese) to embrace Christianity. From the end of the 20th century to the beginning of the 21st century, many missionaries from the United States came to Indonesia to spread the Gospel and Pentecost flow. These streams that are often called \"carismics\" are streams that are considered \"moderns\" because they combine traditional Christian beliefs with modern thinking. With the number of huggers of about 2.5 billion people, divided into three major branches, which are Catholic Christians, Protestant Christians, and Eastern Orthodox Christians, Christianity is the largest religion in the world. The percentage of Christians from the rest of the world's population survived in the 33% range over the last hundred years, which means that one in three people in the world embraced Christianity. This percentage doesn't actually show the huge shift that has taken place in Christian demographics, which is the huge increase in the number of Christians in developing countries that have taken place as there is a huge decline in Christian Christianity in Europe and North America.",

Symptoms usually appear ten to fifteen days after being bitten. If left untreated, the disease may have relapsed a few months later. In those who have just survived infections, reinfection usually causes mild symptoms. This partial immunity disappears for months to several years if the person is not exposed constantly to malaria. The disease is most often transmitted by infected female Anopheles. A mosquito bite inserts parasites from mosquito saliva into someone's blood. Parasites move to hearts where they grow up and reproduce. Five species of Plasmodium can infect and spread by humans. Most deaths are caused by P. falcipulum because P. vivax, P. ovale, and P. malariae generally causes lighter forms of malaria. The species of P. Knowlesi rarely causes human disease. Malaria is usually diagnosed with microscopic blood tests using blood films, or with rapid diagnostic tests based on anthygens. Methods that use polymerase chain reactions to detect parasitic DNA have been developed, but little is used in areas where common malaria is due to its cost and complexity. The risk of disease can be reduced by preventing mosquito bites by using mosquito nets and insect resistance, or by eradication of mosquito nests (PSN) such as insecticide spraying and draining pools of water.

In red blood cells, parasites breed further, sexually again, periodically coming out of their host cells to attack fresh red blood cells. Some of these amplification cycles occur. Thus, the classic description of a fever wave arises from a simultaneous merozoit wave escapes and infects red blood cells. Some sporozoit P. vivax did not soon develop into merozoit-exoric phases, but it produced hypozoits that doured for a specific period ranging from months (7-10 typical months) to several years. After domance, they reenact and produce merozoit. Hipnozoit is responsible for long incubation and the final relaxion of the P. vivax infection, although its existence in P. ovale is uncertain. These parasites are relatively protected from attacks on the immune system because in most of the human life cycles of the parasite are within the liver and blood cells and are relatively invisible to immune surveillance.",

To avoid this, the parasitic P. falcipulum shows a protein tape on the surface of infected blood cells, causing blood cells to attach to the walls of small blood vessels, so parasites are not through general circulation and spleen. Microvasculature insertion causes symptoms like placenta malaria. Red blood cells can penetrate the blood-brain barrier and cause cerebral malaria. According to a 2005 review, because of the high mortality and morbidity caused by malaria the primary species of P. falcipulumalaria has put the greatest selective pressure on the human genome in recent history. Some genetic factors provide some resistance to it including the properties of sickle cells, the attributes of thalasemia, the deficiency of dehidrogenase of glucose-6-phosphate, and the absence of antigen Duffy in red blood cells. The effect of sickle cell properties on malaria's resistance represents several evolutionary exchanges that occur because of endemic malaria. The properties of sickle cells cause changes in the hemoglobin molecules in the blood. Normally, red blood cells have a very flexible form of biconcaf that allows them to move through narrow capillaries; yet, when the modified hemoglobin S molecules are exposed to a low amount of oxygen, or clustered together because of dehydration, they can merge into strands that cause the cell to be scythe-shaped or curved. In the form of a string of hemoglobin molecules is ineffective in taking or releasing oxygen, and cells are not flexible enough to circulate freely. In the early stages of malaria, parasites can cause infected red blood cells to form sickle, and so they are removed from circulation quickly. This will reduce the frequency of malaria parasites to complete their life cycle inside the cell. The homozygote individual (with two copies of the beta abnormal hemoglobin allele) has sickle - cell anemia, while those with heterozygote (with one abnormal allele and one normal alel) have resistance to malaria without heavy anemia.",

This syndrome is sometimes called malaria hepatitis. Although it has been considered a rare event, malaria's hepatopathy has improved, especially in Southeast Asia and India. Liver compromises in people with malaria correlate with greater probability of complications and death. Because of the non-specific properties of malaria, malaria diagnosis in non-ensomal areas requires a high level of suspicion, which may be posed by one of these: recent history of travel, spleen enlargement, fever, low number of blood platelets, and a higher bilirubin rate than normal in blood combined with normal levels of white blood cells. Malaria is usually confirmed by microscopic examinations of blood films or rapid diagnostic tests (rapid diagnostic tests, RDT) based on DNA. Microscopes are the most common method of detecting malaria parasites about 165 million blood films examined for malaria in 2010. Despite widespread use, microscope diagnostics have two major weaknesses: many of the (especially rural) circumstances are not equipped for tests, and results depend on the skills of those who examine blood films and blood parasites. Blood film sensitivity ranged 75-90% in optimum conditions, up to 50% low.

Although tests based on polymerase chain reactions have been developed, they have little use in areas where malaria is common in 2012, because of its complexity. Malaria has been classified as \"bad\" or \"uncomplication\" by the World Health Organization.

There's a wide difference in the cost of the control program (which is low endemic maintenance) and the elimination of the state.

The beard's growth is linked to the follicle stimulation of hair in the area by dihyrotestosterone, which continues to affect the growth of beards after puberty. Dihydrotestosterone also causes baldness. Dihydrotestosterone is produced from testosterone, which vary according to seasons. The growth rate of beards is also genetic. Biologists characterize beards as secondary sexual characteristics because they are found only in one sex, but they do not play a direct role in reproduction. Charles Darwin first suggested a possible evolutionary explanation of the beard in his work The Descent of Man, hypothesizing that the process of sexual selection may have caused the growth of the beard. Modern biologists have reiterated the role of sexual selection in beard evolution, summarizing evidence that the majority of women find men with beards more attractive than men without beards.

This can be a simple redoxyxic process such as carbon oxidation that produces carbon dioxide, or carbon reduction by hydrogen produces methane (CH4), or it can be a complex process such as sugar oxidation in the human body through a complex array of electron transfers. The redox term comes from two concepts, which is reduction and oxidation. It can easily be explained this way: Although it is appropriate to use it for various purposes, the above explanation is not exactly correct. Oxidation and reduction actually refer to the change in oxidation numbers because the actual electron transfer won't always happen. So oxidation is better defined as an increase in oxidation, and reduction as a decrease in oxidation numbers. In practice, electron transfers will always change oxidation numbers, but there are a lot of reactions classified as \"redoxes\" even though there are no electron transfers in that reaction (e.g. involving covalent bonds). Non-redox reactions that don't involve formal charge changes (formal charge) are known as methesis reactions.

The compounds of reformers vary greatly. Metal elements like Li, Na, Mg, Fe, Zn, and Al can be used as reformors. These metals will give away its electrons easily. Another type of reformer is the hybrid transfer reagen, e.g. NaBH4 and LiAlH4), these reagens are used extensively in organic chemistry, especially in the reduction of carbonil compounds into alcohol. Another useful reduction method involves hydrogen gas (H2) with palladium, platinum, or nickel, which is primarily used to reduce double bond ata three carbon-carbon bond. An easy way to look at the redox process is to transfer its electrons to oxidators. So in reaction, the conductor releases electrons and oxidizes, and the oxidators get electrons and are reduced. An oxidator and conductor couple involved in a reaction are referred to as a redox pair. One example of the redox reaction is between hydrogen and fluorin: we can write this whole reaction as two half reaction: oxidation and a half-redirection reaction would make the entire chemical process more clear. Since there is no total yield of charge during redox reactions, excessive number of electrons in oxidation reactions must be equal to the amount consumed in reduction reactions. The elements, even in the molecular form, often have zero oxidation numbers. In the above reaction, hydrogen is oxidized from oxidation number 0 to +1, while fluorine is reduced from oxidation to -1.

He developed a transcendental method of searching of philosophy. The transcendental idea is considered to be the goal of controlling thought in the framework of science. He started philosophy thinking with questions about the source of the basic nature of the subject. All questions not related to this main question are not considered at all. The philosophical investigation was done by first knowing of events that had subjects that could be investigated with empirical evidence. Through this thought, there is a known object of knowledge on the subject, but its nature is unrecognizable. The only known thing is what's on the subject. In all forms of knowledge, the Kant philosophy method requires activation in the development of subjects of knowledge. Kant proposed a critical theory that states that there are two sources of science that are sense and experience. Kant's view of the source of knowledge balances between rationalism and empirism.",

Kant then balances them both through synthesis on the element of recognition of knowledge. It states that the materials of knowledge accepted by reason come from empirical evidence that include senses and experience. Kant synthesized the element of apriori on rationalism with an 'teriori element on empirism. He believes that apriori elements are needed by all knowledge accomplished by man through the senses. This apriori element must exist before the experience takes place. It gives an example to the condition of the element of shape, space and time that makes things up in human observation. These three elements have existed ahead of time in the human sense before there were observations and experiences. Apriori in Kant's opinion directs the object of observation to reason. Through this view, Kant viewed study as a spiritual substance. The process was created and built by itself. Kant referred to his theory of morals as a categorical imperative principle. In this principle, all are treated equally in freedom. Every human has the right to be treated equally and obliged to treat others equally. He viewed God as the highest good that provides life in the everlasting future in a moral sense. He proposes that good deeds are done to him for his own good. And when We give man a taste of mercy from Us, he rejoices in it. Kant believes that morally, every human act in the world will receive justice by God in the afterlife.

There is no blame on you if you make an excuse. Kant's view is known as conduct on the basis of legality. The Kant views the status of moral norms as higher than legal norms. Responsibility to morals must be based on a human conscience. Meanwhile, Kant considers it a crime not a good deed for evildoers or for society. He argued that the criminal was given in return for the crime committed by the perpetrator. Kant claims that the criminal is part of the crime itself. Kant sets mind for ethics. The view of ethics is determined by the will to acquire the essence of something. The ethics presented by the Kant can bring about deeds or actions along with awareness of duty. Moreover, in Kant's view, humans are highly dignified creatures. Education is needed by humans to perfect a high - tempered and responsible human being. A whole human nature is built on educators for individuals and groups. The role of education is to produce individuals who are capable of giving in to their own skills and thus benefit themselves and others. Immanuel Kant acknowledged the connection between justice and freedom. His confession was delivered through his book Metaphysical Elements of Justice. Kant stated in his book that humans have only one innate right to freedom. The right to this freedom can only be gained during this freedom rendered equally to everyone.

This principle is known as the principle of alterity or the equation of recognition. Kant believes that autonomy over freedom is owned by morals. Determination of something called good and evil is a duty of reason. Kant became one of the philosophers who used teleological arguments to reveal the nature and existence of God. In this argument, all of nature's symptoms occur because someone arranged them and not just by chance. The order of the universe indicates that nature is created by an all-powerful substance. It's this substance known as God. Kant argues that the status of the omnipotent can be raised into a creator through deep reasoning. Kant developed metaphysics using apriori elements. The metaphysics developed by Kant set the concept for theory and practice. The theoretical metaphysics developed to determine the human requirements for thought. While practical conditions were developed to determine the human requirements of action. Kant metaphysics uses experience objects that differ from formal logic. It forms a new way of thinking in metaphysics. Immanuel Kant set out 12 categories to establish an epistemology basis for natural science. This whole kateogri was presented in his work entitled Criticism of the Pure Narars. The Kant divides this whole category into four groups of quantity, quality, relation and modulation. The quantity includes unity, cruelty and wholeness. Quality groups include reality, negation and restrictions. The relations group includes substance, causality and reciprocity.

Immanuel Kant was one of the thinkers who examined the origin of the Solar System. He was one of those who followed the Monotheistic order. This Mazhab was one of two mazhabs that explained the Solar System to the 1960s. In this mazhab, it is believed that the building blocks of everything in the solar system come from one same matter. Immmanuel Kant was a popular figure of Montesquieu's teachings regarding separation of power. Kandt expanded the use of the concept of separation of power in the term trias polytica. This term was originally introduced by John Locke by the separation of power into legislative, executive and federative. Then by Montesquieu, the federative power was converted into judicial power. In Kant's definition, all three are considered to be branches of power. In addition, Kant also had opinions regarding political goals. Kant argued that politics was made to meet material needs and spiritual happiness. Politics is made so that everyone can be satisfied with its arrangement. The aesthetic in Kant's view is a human ability to observe the beauty of its environment regularly. The importance of human beauty indicates that humans have feelings that appreciate quality. Humans have made beauty by imitating the environment since ancient times. One characteristic of human aesthetics is that there is a flow of naturalism in art. In the Criticism of Pure Narar, Kant also explained the limitations of reason. Kant investigated the limits of the ability of reason in achieving knowledge. The conclusion is that knowledge of reason always begins with experience. Therefore the use of pure sense is impossible for humans to know something beyond experience.

A whole thing appears in the form of the hierarchy of the topic. This hierarchy consists of key topics and subordinates topics. Reconstruction of text as a whole only recognized when parts have been recognized. On the contrary, details can be understood once the parts are understood as a whole. A assessment of the level of interest of something is just an educated guess. Kant states that the law is the whole requirement required to adjust the free will of every human based on the principle of independence. Kant's thinking about the adopted law, modified and developed into neo-cantianism in the 20th century. Kant's thinking affected Friedrich Julius Stahl in thinking about the country. Stahl proposes the theory of a state of law with the sovereignty of a country owned by law. The elements of legal order include the protection of human rights and the guarantor of it through separation of power. Moreover, the government was held by law, while disputes were settled through the administration's justice. Charles Sanders Peirce coined the term \u25aapragmatism into the source of the philosophy of Immanuel Kant. Immanuel Kant's philosophy uses two words similar to pragmatism. These two words mean different. The first word is practical (Greek: practicals) and pragmatsch (Greek: pragmatics). The practical term refers to being interpreted as an act with a purpose intended for itself. Rangulah only exists in common sense and not in real experience. The pragmatisch, on the other hand, means a motion of the will of man that is used to achieve goals definitively. This action is an important stage to clarify thinking. In Kant's work there is the term pragmatic belief which means the level of hypothetical belief. This belief has the possibility of achieving certain goals in the real world.

The types of time gauges or main clocks are: the scale of time is measured by units: each society has a relatively different view of the time they live in. For example: Western society sees time as a straight line. The concept of a straight line of time is followed by a concept of the order of events. In other words, human history is seen as a process of traveling in a time line from ancient times, present times, and future times. Unlike Western society, Hindu society sees time as a cycle that repeats itself over and over again. The view of time is not merely a matter of looking at the seconds of a watch on a wall that is constantly spinning and waiting for the command of everyone, but time is more viewed as an opportunity, money, and a work that continues to carve endless life. Time freedom takes place where people are able to give all their works, their copyright, and their carbs to everyone. To measure the speed of time scale (in electronic and semiconductor worlds), most people use units: In the world of physics, the dimensions of time and dimensions of space (long, vast, and volume) are fundamental measurements, besides the mass of an object (time, length and mass).

Iron is the most common element on earth based on mass, forming most of the outer core and the interior of the earth. Iron is the fourth largest element in the earth's crust. Its abundance on rocky earth-like planets because of the abundance of production caused by fusion reactions in large mass stars, where the production of nickel-56 (which collapses into the most common iron isotopes) was the final exothermal nuclear fusion reaction. As a result, radioactive nickels are the last ingredient produced before a massive supernova collapse. The collapse scatters the precursor radionuclide iron into space. Like other elements of the 8th class, iron is at a wide range of oxidation levels, \u25aa2 to +6, although +2 and +3 are the most. Iron elements are found in meteorites and other low - oxygen environments, but they are reactive with oxygen and water. Fresh iron surfaces appear to be glistening gray, but oxidized in normal air produce iron oxide hydrate, known as rust. Unlike other metals that form a layer of pasivation oxide, iron oxide occupys more space than its own metals and then peels, exposing fresh surfaces to corrosion. Iron metal has been used since ancient times, although copper alloys, which have lower melting points, are used earlier in human history. Pure iron is relatively soft, but it cannot be obtained through smelting. This material hardens and is significantly reinforced by the dirt, the carbon in particular, of the smelting process.

Iron forms binary compounds with halegens and calogens. The compound of organologists includes the ferosen, the first sandwich compound found. Iron plays an important role in biology, forming a complex with molecular oxygen in hemoglobin and myoglobin; these two compounds are oxygen - carrying proteins in vertebrates. Iron is also metal in the active part of most redox enzymes that play a role in cellular respiration and oxidation and reduction in plants and animals. The nature of iron mechanics and their alloys can be evaluated using various tests, including Brinell's tests, Rockwell's tests and Vickers' violent tests. The data on iron is so consistent that it is often used for calibrations of tools or comparison tests. The nature of iron mechanics, however, is strongly influenced by the purity of samples: single crystal pure iron for the use of collection of facts is more soft than aluminum, and the iron produced by industry's most pure (99.99%) is violent. The increase in carbon in iron would cause a significant increase in violence and the power of attraction.

Iron meteorites are highly respected for their origin in the sky and are often used to forge weapons and tools or all the specimens placed in churches. Stuff made of iron by the Egyptians dated 2500 to 3000 BC. Iron has a different advantage than bronze for war equipment. Iron is much harder and more sustainable than bronze, although it is prone to rust. However, the thing. This has been opposed. Hittitologist Trevor Bryce argued that before advanced iron processing techniques were developed in India, the iron weapon meteorite used by the early Mesopotamian army had a tendency to be easily destroyed in battle, since its high carbon content. The first iron production began during the Middle Bronze Age but took several centuries before it could replace bronze. Examples of molten iron from Asmar, Mesopotamia and Tall Chagar Bazaar in northern Syria were made between 2,700 and 3,000 B.C.E.",

They began to melt iron between 1,500 and 1,200 B.C.E. and this practice spread to the Near East after their empire fell in 1,180 B.C.E. The next period is called the Iron Age. The scattering of iron, therefore called the Iron Age, reached Europe two hundred years later and arrived in Zimbabwe, Africa in the 8th century. In China, iron only appeared around 700-500 BC. The scattering of iron has been introduced to China through Central Asia. Early evidence of the use of the high furnace in China in the first century after masehi, and the dome furnace (English: furnaces) was used at the beginning of the war period (403:221 BCE). The use of high furnaces and domes remained spreading during the Song and Tang Dynasty. Melted iron artifacts were found in India in the mountains between 1,800 and 1,200 B.C.E., and in Levant from about 1,500 B.C.E. (showing smelting in Anatolia or the Caucasus). Iron processing entered Greece at the end of the 11th century B.C. The spread of iron processing in Central and Western Europe is linked to the expansion of the Celts. According to Gaius Pliny Secundus (Pliny the Elder), the use of iron was plural in the Roman era. The annual iron production of the Roman Empire was estimated to be 84,750 tons, while the densely populated Chinese Han produced about 5,000 tons. During the British Industrial Revolution, Henry Cort began smoothing iron iron using innovative production systems. In 1783 he patented the puddling process to process iron ore. This process was then perfected by another researcher, including Joseph Hall. Iron cast (or cast cor) (English: cast iron) was first produced in China during the 5th century B.C.E., but was hardly known in Europe until the medieval period.",

The molten iron was used by ancient China for war equipment, agriculture, and architecture. During the medieval period, European iron production of cast iron was found (in this context known as rough iron) by using finery fortune. In this whole process, coal is used as fuel. The height of the medieval high has about 10 feet (3.0 m) and is made of fire - resistant bricks; pressure air is obtained from hand - driven blowers. Modern high ground is much bigger. In 1709, Abraham Darby I formed a high coal furnace to produce molten iron. Cheap iron availability is one of the factors that led to the Industrial Revolution. Toward the end of the 18th century, cast iron began to replace cast iron for a specific purpose, for the price was cheaper. The carbon content in iron was not seen as an excuse to distinguish the nature of tempal iron, cast iron, and steel until the 18th century. Since iron became cheaper and more abundant, iron also became a major structural material following the innovative construction of the first iron bridge in 1778. Steel (with a carbon content smaller than rough iron but more than forge iron) was first produced using bloomery. The blacksmith of Luristan, western Iran made fine steel in 1,000 B.C.E. Then, the drag version is, Wootz steel by India and Damascus steel developed about 300 B.C.E. and 500 after mashri. This method was a specialty, and therefore steel did not become a major commodity until the 1850s. The new method of production was through iron carburate bars in a cementation process discovered in the 17th century.",

In the late 1850s, Henry Bessemer created a new steel-making process, involving an air blow through a rough iron melt to produce soft steel. This makes steel much more economical, therefore forge iron no longer produced. In 1774, Antoine Lavoisier reacted the water vapor with metal iron in the iron tube to produce hydrogen in an experiment that led to a mass conservation demonstration, which changed the chemical instrumentation of qualitative science into quantity. The anaerobic oxidation of iron at high temperatures is schemed by the following reaction: Iron or steel production is a process with two major stages, unless the desired product is molten iron. The first stage is the production of rough iron in a high furnace. Either way, direct reduction. Second stage, rough iron is converted into forge iron or steel. For some limited functions like the electromagnet core, pure iron is produced by way of electrolysis the fero sulfate solution. The production of iron industry begins with iron ore, usually hematite, with the formula Fe2O3, and magnetite, with the formula Fe3O4. The ore is reduced to metal in a carbothermal reaction, which is treated with carbon. This conversion is common in a high furnace at a temperature of about 2000 \u00b0C. Carbon is supplied in the form of coke. The process also contains fluxes such as limestone, which is used to eliminate silica minerals in ore, which can mimic furnaces. Coke and gampas were inserted through the top of the furnace, when there was a massive explosion during air warming, about 4 tons per ton of iron, which was pumped into the furnace through the bottom.",

Other special fluxes are used depending on ore characteristics. The heat in the furnace caused the gamping flux to decomposition into calcium oxide (also known as Laughter): Then calcium oxide reacted with silicon dioxide forming a slag. Slag melted from the heat of the furnace. At the bottom of the furnace, the slag floats on a denser iron melt, and the windows on the side of the furnace are opened to flow and separate the iron from the slag. Iron, when it has been cold, is called rough iron (pig iron), while slag can be used as a road construction material or a poor soil plugin of minerals for agriculture. Due to environmental problems, an alternative method of iron processing has been developed. Direct iron reduction reduces iron ore to powder called \"now\" or direct iron suitable for steel-making. Two major reactions to direct reduction process: Silika was eliminated with an added gamping flux as it has been described above. Metal iron is generally produced in labs through two methods. The first is fero chloride electrolysis on iron cathode. The second method involves iron reduction oxide with hydrogen gas at a temperature of about 500 \u00b0C. South Iron is the most used metal, including 92% of the world's metal production.n 1] Its low cost and high strength makes it essential in engineering applications such as engine construction and machine equipment, cars, hulls of large ships, and building structure components.",

Iron available to commercials is classified based on its purity and additive content. Pig iron has 3.5-4.5% of the carbon and contains a wide range of contaminations like sulfur, silicon and phosphorus. Pig iron is not a commercial product, but it is a stage between the production of iron and steel. Contamination in pig irons that have a negative effect on material traits, such as sulfur and phosphorus, produces molten iron containing 210% carbon, 110:6% silicon, and a small number of mangans. It has a melting point in the 1420-1470 K range, lower than one of the two main components, and makes it the first product that will melt when carbon and iron are heated together. Its mechanical properties vary greatly and depend on the carbon in the mixture. The \"white\" cast iron contains carbon in the form of fertite, or iron-carbide. This strong and fragile compound dominates the nature of this white cast metal mechanic, thus staying hard, but unable to withstand shock. The broken white cast iron surface is full of fine scraps of iron-carbide, milk of shiny material, musculent and very pale. In gray iron, carbon is a fine fragment of graphite separated, and it also makes a fragile material because of its sharp-eyed fragments that generates an allocation concentration of voltage in matter. A new variety of gray iron, referred to as elastic iron treated specifically with magnesium in the amount of renic to convert graphite into spheroids, or nodules, reduce voltage concentration and increase material resilience and strength. Formation iron contains less than 0.25% of the carbon, but it contains large amounts of fluctuation so that it gives fibrous characteristics.

The traditional blacksmithing and tempirism products have been almost completely replaced by light steel. Light steel rusts more easily than forge iron, but it is cheaper and more available. Carbon steel contains 2.0% carbon or less, plus a little bit of manganese, sulfur, phosphorus, and silicon. Combination steel contains various amounts of carbon and other metals, such as chromium, vanadium, molibdenum, nickel, wolfram, and so on. Its intermediary jacks costs, so it is usually used only for special purposes. One common steel alloy, is nirkarat steel. The latest development in iron metallurgy has produced a variety of steel micro alloys, which are called \"HSLA\" steel, containing a little extra strength and usually spectacular resilience at minimal cost. In spite of traditional applications, iron is also used for protection from ion radiation. Although it is lighter than any other traditional protection material, lead, it is much more mechanically powerful. Radiation atenuation as an energy function is shown on the graph. The ultimate loss of iron and steel is that pure iron, and most of its mixture, can form rust if not protected. The paint, the galvanization, the pastivation, the plastic layering and the refraction are all used to protect iron from rust by blocking the entry of water and oxygen or with cathodic protection. Although metallurgy plays a dominant role in numbers, iron compounds are widely used by both industry and other uses.

Iron acquisitions face problems for aerobic organisms, since ferry ions are difficult to dissolve at pH near neutral. Hence, bacteria have involved a sequencing compound called siderofora (English: siderophore). Once absorbed, in a cell, iron storage is carefully regulated; iron ions are \"free\" not readily available. The primary component that regulates this is the transferin protein, which binds the iron ions absorbed from the duodenum and transports them through the directional stream to the cell. In animals, plants, and mushrooms, iron is often a complex heme - shaped ion. Heme is an essential component of cytochrome proteins, which regulate redox reactions, and essential components of oxygen - carrying proteins such as hemoglobin, myoglobin, and leghemoglobin. Anorganic iron contributes to redox reactions in clusters of iron-belt enzymes, such as nitrogenase (involved in ammonia synthesis of nitrogen and hydrogen) and hydrogenase. Protein iron non-heme includes methane enzyme monooxygenase (ordination of methane into methane), ribonucleotide reductase (reducing ribosia to deoxyribose; biosynthesis of DNA), hemertrine (transportation of oxygen and fixation in marine invertebrates) and purple phosphate acids (hydrosisester phosphate). Iron distribution is highly regulated in mammals, especially since iron ions are potentially high on biological toxicity.

Another subclass, which is Cestodaria, is mostly parasites in fish. All members of Cestodes act as parasites and their living cycles vary, but usually adult worms live in the digestive tracts of vertebrates, and young worms sometimes live in other species, both vertebrates and invertebrates. For example, the genus Diphyllobothrium has two intermediary hosts, one crustacean and at least one freshwater fish, while its definitive host is a mammal. Some types of Cestodes are specific to their host, while others become parasites in various species. Some 6,000 species of Cestode have been descripted, and perhaps all vertebrates act as hosts for at least one species of Cestode. Adult tapeworms have a head, a short neck, and a corrugated body composed of proglotid-proglotid. The tapeworm attaches itself to the inner part of the host's intestine using scolex, which generally has hooks, suckers, or both. Cestodes don't have mouths and they suck nutrients directly from their host's digestive tract. The worm's neck constantly produces proglotid. Every proglotid has a reproductive channel. The ripe proglotid is filled with eggs and will separate from the worm body and leave the host body, either passively in host waste or actively moving.

The quality of intake can be improved by reducing the consumption of solid energy foods such as high fats and sugars, as well as increasing fiber intake. Anti-fat medicines can be consumed to reduce their appetite or inhibit fat absorption, along with proper dietary intake. If diet, exercise, and medicine are not effective, then gastric balloons can help reduce weight or surgery can be done to reduce gastric volume and bowel length. It can give you an earlier appetite and lower the nutrient absorption of food. Fatigue is the most preventable cause of death in the world, with increased prevalence in adults and children, so authorities regard obesity as one of the most serious public health problems of the 21st century.",

It's not like in fat developed countries, it's mostly men, so in fat Indonesia most of them are women. Fatigue is a medical condition of excess body fats that accumulate in such a way that they cause damage to health. Fatty is judged by indexing body mass (IMT), and it's next based on the distribution of fat through the waist-inflated ratio and a total cardiovascular risk factor. IMT is very closely related to the body fat percentage and total body fat. In children healthy weight vary according to age and gender. The obesity of children and adolescents is not defined by an absolute number, but in relation to the history of the group with normal weight, obesity is defined when the IMT is greater than the 95th percentile. The reference data that became the basis for this percentageile came from 1963 to 1994, and therefore has not been affected by the recent gain in weight. The IMT is calculated by dividing the weight of the subject with a square height, which is usually written both in metric units and in the American system: lb{\\displaystyle lb} is the weight of the subject in the pon and in\\displaystyle in\" is the height of the subject within inches. The most widely used definitions are made by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1997 and published in 2000, as shown on the table on the right.",

Because Asian populations show the negative impact of obesity on health at lower IMT values than Caucasian populations, some countries are re-defined obesity; as in Japan that defines obesity as an IMT value over 25 while China uses IMT values over 28. Overweight is associated with various diseases, especially cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes mellitus, obstructive sleep apnea, certain cancers, osteoarthritis and asthma. Therefore, obesity has proved to lower life expectancy. Fattyness is one of the leading preventable causes of death in the world. Vast - scale studies in America and Europe show that the lowest risk of mortality occurs at IMT 20 \u25aa25 kg/m2 in non-smoker groups and 24120 kg/m2 in smoker groups, with increasing risks as the IMT changes in both directions. IMT is more than 32 associated with the mortality rate twice as high in women after 16 years later. In the United States, obesity is estimated to increase the number of deaths by 111,909 to 365 per year, while 1 million deaths (7.7%) in Europe are associated with excess weight. Average obesity will reduce life expectancy by up to six to seven years: IMT 30 JULY35 reduces life expectancy by two to four years, while heavy obesity (IMT > 40) reduces life expectancy by 10 years. Fatigue increases the risk of physical and mental disorders. The commorbidity is most commonly seen in metabolic syndrome, which is a combination of medical disorders: Type 2 diabetes melitus, high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, and high triglyceride levels.",

There's a variation of the power of relationship between obesity and certain diseases. One of the most powerful relationships is with type 2 diabetes. Excess body fat is a 64% cause of male and 77% diabetes in women. The health consequences that occur are divided into two major categories, which are: the consequences of increasing fat mass (e. g. osteoarthritis, apnea obstructive sleep, social stigma) and the consequences that result from the increasing number of fat cells (diabetes, cancers, cardiovascular diseases, disease of non-alcoholic liver eating). The increase in body fat alters the body's response to insulin to potentially cause insulin resistance. Increased fats also result in prolatory conditions, and protrombosis. Although the negative impact of obesity on the general population is sustained by strong evidence, certain subgroup health seems better when the IMT is greater. This phenomenon is known as the obsolescence paradox. The paradox was first presented in 1999 in a group of more nutrition patients and overweight hemodialysis, which was found also in patients with heart failure and peripheral arterial disease. The patient's heart failure with IMT between 30,0 and 34.9 shows a lower mortality rate than that of a patient with normal weight. This is associated with the fact that a person's weight increases as he gains the weight of disease. Something similar has been discovered in another type of heart disease. Patients with first grade obesity who have heart disease do not develop faster into advanced heart disorders than normal weight patients with heart disease.",

Another study showed that if the lung disease is clusively chronical (PPOK) also found in patients with peripheral arterial disease then obesity is no longer a profitable condition. In individuals per individual, the combination of excess food energy intake and lack of physical activity can explain most cases of obesity. A small number of cases are largely caused by genetic factors, medical reasons, or mental illness. On the contrary, increased rates of obesity may be caused by easy access to food and good food, increased auto dependency, and increased use of machines for production. An review in 2006 identified ten other possible causes of increased obesity recently: (1) lack of sleep, (2) various endocrine bullies (e.g. antipsychological metabolism), (3) decreased environmental temperatures, (4) decreased smoking consumption, (5) increased the use of drugs that cause weight gain (for example, antipsychotic atipal), (6) increased ethnicity and age groups that are proportionally more severe, (7) older pregnancy (that can cause the laxity of children to become obese), (8) epigenetics that are sent down between generations, (9th) of natural selections, and (10 times) causing increased concentration (a pair that will increase in fatness).",

The per capita food energy supply vary greatly from region to country. This too changed significantly in accordance with time. From the early 1970s to the late 1990s the average calories available per person per day (the number of foods purchased) have risen in many parts of the world except in Eastern Europe. The United States reached its highest availableness by 3,654 calories per person in 1996. This continued to grow in 2003 to 3,754. In the late 1990s, Europe reached 3,334 calories per person, in the Asian developing area of 2,648 calories per person, and in sub-Saharan Africa, people got 2,176 calories per person. Total calories consumption has been proven to be associated with obesity. The wide supply of nutrition guidelines has little to do with overeating and poor food choices. From 1971 to 2000, the rate of obesity in the United States increased from 14.5% to 30.9%. Over the same period, an increase in food energy consumption is also occurring. For women, the average increase is 335 calories a day (1,542 calories in 1971 and 1,877 calories in 2004), while for men the average increase is 168 calories a day (2,450 calories in 1971 and 2,618 calories in 2004). Most of this food's energy overload comes from increasing carbohydrate consumption rather than from fat consumption. The main source of this excess carbohydrate comes from sweet drinks, which is currently up to nearly 25 percent of the daily energy of young adult foods in America, and potato chips.",

As society's growing reliance on solid foods - energy, large or fast - food, the relationship between fast - food and obesity becomes increasingly noticeable. In the United States fast food consumption tripled and food energy intake from this food increased fourfold between 1977 and 1995. Agricultural and technical policy in the United States and Europe has led to the decline in food prices. In the United States, subsidies for corn, soybeans, wheat and rice through the U.S. farm law have made major sources of food that have been processed cheap compared with fruits and vegetables. People who suffer from obesity consistently report less foods they consume than people with normal weight. This is supported by tests carried out both in caloriesmeters and by direct observation. A less mobile life - style has an important role to play in obesity. Around the world there is a tendency to shift jobs that demand less physical activity, and today at least 60% of the world's population is not doing enough exercise. This is largely due to the increased use of mechanical transportation and increased physical - energy technology at home. In children, a decline in physical activity appears to be due to a lack of walking and lack of exercise lessons. The world's propensity in actively filling free time for physical activity seems less real. The World Health Organization states that people worldwide lack the pursuit of recreation that involves physical activity, while studies in Finland show increased and studied in the United States indicating no significant changes in recreation involving physical activity.",

One study found that 63 of the 73 studies (86%) showed an increase in child obesity as media exposure increased, with a proportional increase in time spent watching television. Like a number of medical conditions, obesity is a combination of genetics and environmental factors.Polimorphism in genes that control appetite and metabolism is a predisposition of obesity when there is sufficient food energy. In 2006 more than 41 of these sites were linked with obesity when there was an appropriate environment. Someone who has two FTO genes (gens associated with fat and overweight mass) has been found to weigh an average of 310 pounds and risk a 1.67 - times greater weight than a person without an allele risk. The saturation of the obese population caused by genetic factors is quite varied, depending on the checked population, and ranging from 6% to 85%. Fatigue is a major representation of some syndrome, such as Prader-Willi Syndrome, Bardet-Biedl Syndrome, Cohen Syndrome, and MOMO Syndrome. (It should be \"fat without syndrome\" sometimes used as an exception to that condition.) In people with early obesity (defined with onset before age 10 and body times index more than three standard deviations above normal), a number of 7% have a single DNA mutation.

Their ability to take advantage at a rare age of abundance, by storing energy of fat will be advantageous during times of erratic food supply, and individuals with more fat piles will be more able to survive the famine. The tendency to store fat, however, would be a poor adjustment to society with a stable food supply. This theory has got various criticisms and other evolution-based theories such as the Drifty gene hypothesis and phenopathy hypothesis theory have also been submitted. Certain physical and mental illness and drugs used to deal with it can increase the risk of obesity. Medical diseases that can increase the risk of obesity include some rare genetic syndrome (above the above) as well as some innate disorders or conditions: hypothyroidism, Cushing Syndrome, growth hormone deficiencies, and eating disorders: overindulgence eating disorders and dinner syndrome. Nevertheless, obesity is not considered a psychiatric disorder, so it is not listed in DSM-IVR as a psychiatric illness. The risk of overweight and overweight patients with psychiatric disorders is higher than that of a person without psychiatric disorders. Certain medications can cause gain in weight or change in body composition; including insulin, sulfonilurea, thizolidinedione, antipsychotic atipical, antidepressants, asteroids, certain anticonceptions, (fenitoin and valproat), pizotives, and some form of hormone contraceptives.

In developing countries, women, men, and children from higher social classes have greater obesity. A newer review was done in 2007 and found the same relationship, but it was weaker. The weakening of this correlation relationship may have been caused by the effects of globalization. In developed countries, adult obesity levels, overweight teen percentages, correlate with income imbalances. Similar relationships are seen among states in the U.S.: more adults, even from high social classes, suffer from obesity in an uneven state. Many explanations are made about the relationship between BMI and social classes. It is estimated that in developed countries, who are more able to buy nutritious food, they are under social pressure to stay slim, and have more opportunities and also more hope for physical fitness. In undeveloped countries the ability to buy food, high energy needs because of physical work, and cultural values that love large bodies, are believed to contribute to visible patterns. A person's attitude toward his body mass also plays an important role in obesity. A correlation to the change of IMT in line with time has been found among friends, brothers, and couples.

A woman's risk is up 7% per child, while a man's risk is up 4% per child. It's partly explained in terms of the fact that having children who haven't been self-sufficient reduces the physical activity of parents in the West. In developing countries, urbanization plays a role in increasing obesity. In China the overall number of obesity is less than 5%; yet, in some cities the large numbers of obesity are greater than 20%. Malagizi in the early stages of life was believed to play a role in increasing obesity in developing countries. Endocrine changes that occur during the malagizi period can stimulate fat storage by the time food energy is available. Consistent with cognitive epidemiative data, a number of studies confirm that obesity is associated with cognitive deficits. Whether obesity causes cognitive deficits or vice versa, it's still unclear. The influence of the infection agent on metabolism is still in its early stages of research. Flora's intestines have proven to be different in a thin, fat human being. There are indications that the intestinal flora in the fat and thin individual affects metabolic potential. These metabolic potential changes are actually believed to change the capacity to be greater to produce the energy that causes obesity.

Flier sums up some possible patophysiological mechanisms involved in the event and survives obesity. Research in this field was almost never done until the discovery of leptin in 1994. Since this discovery, many other hormoneal mechanisms have been explained, which have played a role in the regulations of appetite and food intake, the storage patterns of the addosia tissue, and insulin resistance. Since the discovery of leptin, there have been studies of grelin, insulin, orexin, PYY 3-36, colesistokine, diponactin, as well as other mediators. Adipokin is a mediator produced by adiposa network; they are thought to be involved in various conditions associated with obesity. Leptin and grelin are considered to be complementary in affecting their appetite, with grelin produced by the stomach to control the short-term appetite (that is, to eat when the stomach is empty and stops when the hull is full) Leptin is produced by the adiposa tissue to signal the body's fat storage, and to provide long - term appetite control (that is, eat more when the fat reserves are low and eat less when the fat reserves are high). While leptin's giving may be effective for a few fat people who lack leptin, most fat people are concerned about leptin and even prove to have a high degree of leptin. This resistance can in part explain why leptin giving does not prove effective in suppressing the appetite of fat people in general. Although leptin and grelin are produced in periphers, they control their appetite by working on the central nervous system. Leptin and grelin, along with other hormones related to appetites, work especially in hypothalamus, areas of the brain that are centers of food intake and energy use.",

This circuit starts with an area in hypothalamus, nuclei arkuata, which comes out in lateral hypothalamus (LH) and hypothalamus ventromedial (VMH), each of which is a hungry center and a saturated center in the brain. Numleus arkuata has two different neuron groups. The first group expressed neuropede Y (NPY) and agouti-related peptide (AgRP) which gave input stimulation to LH and input inspiration to VMH. The second group expresss pro-opiomelanokortin (POMC) and cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) and gives stimulation input to VMH and input inhibition to LH. As a result, the NPY/AgRP neuron stimulates the eating and inhibiting the saturation, while the POMC/CART neuron generates a saturation and inhibiting eating. Both groups of nuclone neurons of this archuata are partially regulated by leptin. Leptin inhibits NPY/AgRP groups and stimulates POMC/CART groups. Therefore, if there is a lack of leptin signals, either because of lack of leptin or leptin resistance, there will be excessive eating, which contributes to some form of genetic obesity and is acquired. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that overweight and overweight in the near future will replace public health problems such as malnutrition and infectious diseases as major causes of poor health.

The settlers built an acropolis adjacent to the Golden Horn at the site of the early Thrakia settlement, encouraging the economy of this newborn city. The city had a short period of Persian rule at the turn of the 5th century B.C., but the Greeks took it back during the Greek-Pesian War. Byzantium then continued as part of the Athens League and its successor, the Second Athens Empire, before gaining independence in 355 B.C.E.",

Five years later Severus began to rebuild Byzantium, and the city was able to regain him as well as, according to some records, beyond the former prosperity. The Great Constantine was effective in becoming emperor of the entire Roman Empire in September 324. Two months later he proposed plans for the stand of a new Christian city to replace Byzantium. As the empire's eastern capital, the city was named Nea Rome; most called Constantinople, a name that remained in use until the 20th century. On May 11, 330, Constantinople was declared capital of an empire then known as the Byzantine Empire or the Eastern Roman Empire. Constantinople's stand was one of Constantine's most enduring achievements, which turned Roman power to the east because it became a center of Greek Christianity and culture. A large number of church buildings were built throughout the city, including Hagia Sophia built during the reign of Justinian the Great and became the largest cathedral in the world until the next thousand years. Constantine also did a huge expansion and renovation of Constantinople's hypodrom; with the capacity of tens of thousands of spectators, the hypodrom became the center of people's lives and in the fifth century also the sixth century became the center of riots, such as the Nika riots. Constantinople's location also ensured its survival of time tests; within centuries, the seaside area and its walls protected Europe against advance forces from the east and Islamic development.",

Constantinople began to experience a constant decline after the end of Basilios II's reign in 1025. The final blow was experienced by the conquest of Guillaume of Villehardouin and Enrico Dandolo in 1204 during the Fourth Crusade, where the city was robbed and plundered. The city, in turn, became the center of the Latin Empire, the creation of Catholic crusaders to replace the Orthodox Byzantine Empire. Agia Sophia was converted into a Catholic church in 1204. Constantinople was taken back in 1261 and the Byzantine Empire recovered even though it was weakened. The infrastructure of basic services, defenses, and church buildings were damaged, and the population had been reduced to one hundred thousand of the five hundred thousand inhabitants during the 8th century.d] After the reconquer of 1261, several city monuments were restored, including the manufacture of two Deisis mosaics in Aghia Sofia and Kariye. Military and economic policies applied by Andronikos II, such as a reduced military force, weakened the empire and made it vulnerable to attack. In the middle of the 14th century, the Turks of Utsmaniyah began a strategy by gradually taking control of smaller cities, cutting off supply routes and slowly pushing them down. On May 29, 1453, after an 8 - week siege (when the last Roman emperor, Constantine XI, was killed), Sultan Mehmed II \"the Conqueror\" seized Constantinople and declared it the new capital of the Utsmaniyah Empire or the Ottoman Empire. A few hours later the sultan went to Hagia Sophia and called a priest to declare Islam, and turned that magnificent cathedral into an imperial mosque because it refused to surrender peacefully.",

He encouraged the return of those who had fled the city during the siege, enforcing Muslims, Jews, and Christians from other parts of Anatolia. The sultan invited people from all over Europe to his capital, forming a cosmopolitan society that survived to most of the Utsmaniyah period. Mehmed II repaired the damaged city infrastructure, starting to build the Grand Bazaar and the Topkap\u0131 Palace that became the sultan's official residence. With the transfer of the capital from Edirne (formerly Adrianopel) to Constantinople, his new country was declared to be the successor and continuance of the Roman Empire. The Utsmaniyah dynasty quickly transformed the city from a bulwark of Christianity into a symbol of Islamic culture. Various religious foundations were set up to fund the construction of imperial mosques full of ornaments, which were often put together with schools, hospitals, and public baths. The Utsmaniyah Dynasty claimed its state of caliphs in 1517 and Istanbul remained the capital of this last caliph for the next four centuries. The time of Suleiman's incredible reign from 1520 to 1566 was a period of special architectural and artistic accomplishments; Mimar Sinan as chief architect designed several iconic buildings in the city along with the development of miniature art, calligraphy, glass, and Utsmanid celadon. Istanbul's population reached 550,000 residents by the end of the 18th century.

These modernization attempts were unable to prevent Utsmaniyah's decline. In the early 20th century, the Young Turkish Revolution caused Sultan Abdul Hamid II to descend to the throne and a series of wars struck the troubled empire's capital. The end of all of this, World War I, resulted in the occupation of Constantinople by the Italians, the French, and the British. The city's Armenian population was also affected by Armenian intellectual deportation on April 24, 1915, where Armenian leaders were arrested and most were killed as part of the Armenian Genocide event. To commemorate Armenian Genocide victims, April 24 was now his memorial day.

This compound is the second lightest halogen, between fluor and bromin in the periodic table and its properties most of them. Chlorine in shape is yellow-green at room temperature. This element is a highly reactive element and a powerful oxidator: the chlorine has the highest electron amplification and the third highest electronegivity behind oxygen and fluor. The most common chlorin compound, sodium chloride, has been known since ancient times. About 1630, the gas chlorine was first synthesized through chemical reactions, but it has yet to be known as an important substance. Carl Wilhelm Scheele wrote a description of the chlorine gas in 1774, viewing it as an oxide of a new element. In 1809, chemists claimed that this gas may have been a pure element, and this was confirmed by Sir Humphry Davy in 1810, named after the Ancient Greek: \u25aa based on its color. Because of its reactivity, all the chlorine in the Earth's crust is in the form of ion chloride compounds (including kitchen salts). This element is the second most abundant haleogen on earth (after fluor) and the 21st most abundant chemical element in the Earth's crust. This large deposit looks small because most of the chloride is found in seawater. Equipment is commercially produced from salt water with electrolysis. The high potential oxidation of chlorine elements triggers the development of commercial bleach and disinfectant, as well as reagen for many processes in the chemical industry. Chlorine is used in the manufacture of various consumer products, about two-thirds of which are organic chemicals such as chloride polyvinil.

In the form of chloride ions, chlorine is needed for all living species. Other types of chlorine compounds rarely exist in living organisms, and other organic compounds containing chlorins are made from inert to toxic. Above the atmosphere, organic molecules containing chlorine such as chlorofluorocarbons have resulted in ozone depletion. The most common chlorin compound, sodium chloride, has been known since ancient times, archaeologists have found evidence that saltstones have been used since the beginning of 3000 B.C.E. and saltwater since early 6000 B.C.E. The importance of this substance in food was well - known in ancient times and was sometimes used as payment for Roman general service and tribune military. The chlorine element is probably first isolated around 1200 with the discovery of aqua regia and its ability to dissolve gold, because chlorine gas is one of the products of this reaction: but it was not recognized as a new substance. About 1630, it was known as gas by Flemish chemist and physician Jan Baptist van Helmont.note 1) This element was first studied in detail in 1774 by Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele, and it was considered the inventor. Scheele produced chlorine by acting MnO2, with HCl: Scheele observed some chlorine properties: bleaching effect on lakmus, deadly on insects, yellow-green color, and smells similar to aqua regia.

In 1809, Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac and Louis-Jacques Th\u00e9nard tried to decipher the compound Scheele discovered by looking at it with charcoal to release a free muriaticum (and carbon dioxide) element. They did not succeed and published a report in which they considered the possibility that the substance was an element, but were not convinced. In 1810, Sir Humphry Davy tried this experiment again, and concluded that this substance was an element, and not a compound. He announced the results to the Royal Society on November 15th of that year. At that time, he named this new element as \"klorin,\" from the Greek word \u25aao\u25aaos, which means green-cubes. The name \"halogen\", meaning \"salt yielder,\" was originally used for chlorine in 1811 by Johann Solomon Christoph Schweigger. This term is then used as a general term to describe all the chlorin family elements (fluor, bromin, iodine), after the advice of J\u00f6ns Jakob Berzelius in 1826. In 1823, Michael Faraday made liquid chlorine for the first time, and it showed what came to be known as solid chlorine, which had a hydrate chlorine structure (Cl2\u00b7H2O). Clorine gas was first used by French chemist Claude Berthollet for textile bleach in 1785. Modern bleaching was produced from further work by Berthollet, who first produced sodium hypochlorite in 1789 in a laboratory in Javel (now part of Paris, France), by skipping the chlorine gas in the sodium carbonate solution.",

Scottish chemist and industrialist Charles Tennant first produced a calcium hypochlorite solution, then a solid calcium hypochlorite. These compounds produce low levels of chlorine and are more efficiently transported than sodium hypochlorite, which remains a diluted solution because when it is purified by eliminating water content, it becomes an oxidator very strong and unstable. Toward the end of the nineteenth century, S. E. Smith patented sodium hypochlorite production methods involving salt - water electrolysis to produce sodium hydroxide and hydrochlorin gas, which was then mixed to form sodium hypochlorite. This is known as the chloroallic process, first introduced on an industrial scale in 1892, and is now the source for the production of most of the chlorine and sodium hydroxide elements. In 1884 Chemischen Fkik Griesheim, Germany again developed a chloroallali process that began commercial production in 1888. The redistribution of chlorine that was dissolved in basic chemistry (natrium and calcium hypochlorite) was first used as an anti-degradation and disinfectant agent in the 1820s, in France, long before the formation of the germ theory of disease. This practice was confirmed by Antoine-Germain Labarrace, which adjusted the bleaching of Berthollet's \"water Javel\" water. The chlorine element then acts as an antisepsis (an irrigation wound solution and the like) and the sanitation of the community, especially in ponds and drinking water.

Both have a nuclear spin of 3/2+ and therefore can be used for nuclear magnetic resonance, although larger than 1/2 will result in a distribution of non-circle nuclear nuclear charge and eventually resonance extends as a result of nuclear quadruption and non-zero quaducular residation. The other chlorine isotopes are all radioactive with too soon. Of all of them, the most common ones in the lab are 36Cl (t1/2 = 3.0\u00d7105) and 38Cl (t1/2 = 37.2 minutes), which can be created from natural chlorine activation. The most stable radioisotop chlorine is 36Cl. The lower mode of isotopes is lighter than 35Cl is the electron capture of isotopes sulfur; isotopes heavier than 37Cl are beta decays against isotopes argon; and 36Cl can collapse into 36S or 36Ar stable. In the subface environment, the capture of muon by 40ca was used to produce 36Cl. Chlorine is intermediate in terms of reactivity between fluor and bromin, and is one of the most reactive elements. Chlorine is an oxidator that is weaker than a fluor, but stronger than a bromin or iodine.

Another approach is to mix sodium chloride with dense sulfuric acid to produce hydrochloric acid, also called \"salt-cake\": In the laboratory, hydrochloric acid can be created by drying this acid with dense sulfuric acid. Deuterium chloride, D.C.l., can be made by having the benzoil chloride in heavy water (D2O).

Modern physics most accurately describes gravity using the general theory of relativity proposed by Albert Einstein in 1915, which describes gravity not as a force, but as a consequence of a \"straight\" mass in a curvature of space-time caused by an uneven distribution of mass. The most extreme example of the curvature of space-time is a black hole, where nothing, not even light, can escape as soon as it passes the horizon of a black hole event.

Practically, the method commonly used in geophysics looks like the table below: Seismic methods are a method based on the concept of disparaging the waves in the earth's medium. Seismic methods are divided into two of active seismic and passive seismic methods, active seismic methods of refraction and reflection that have been standardized in exploration, for passive seismic methods using seismic waves produced by nature so that they can be used to see or predict earthquake disasters, but the development is less so that they are rarely used for exploration. The cysmic method can do mapping and monitoring, in performing symptoms of increased seismic activity on the volcano. The presence of magma in the earth's rising stomach affects seismic activity, and when the rock is already unable to withstand pressure, the volcanic earthquake will occur. In the world of exploration and earth's gas, seismic methods are used to get the depth and resolution of good seismic layers primarily using seismic reflections with additional data logs of wells.",

The object within the gravitational field then the force of gravity will work, the room that has mass and the acceleration value of gravity called the gravitational field. The method of gravity can be used to look at subsurface structural conditions and geothermal equality interpretations for advanced exploration. In oil exploration, the method of gravity is used as a secondary method of cost less than seismic methods, non-invasive, non-destructive and passive, to obtain data with a method of gravity doesn't need to put energy into the ground, so this method is suitable for the inhabited environment. This method was used as a detailed follow-up of magnetic and electromagnetic anomalies during the survey. Gravity includes natural sources such as magnetism, and radioactivity. Gravity and magnetism are grouped as potential methods, with a difference in which magnetic state relies on a magnetic field. Magnetic methods are widely used as precursor surveys of oil exploration, earth's heat, rock or fire monitoring or search for targets of steel/ircumbered goods, such as unexploded weaponry, electrical channels, or buried cables can be targeted, areas with magnetic rock like basalts mapped by magnetic methods. The accuracy of the measurements is high with simple field operations. Maps of magnetic field anomalies in general are complex that indicate the number of anomaly residues that cause a relatively difficult geomagnetic method interpretation. The geoelectric method of prisoners of type or resistivity is used to map geological structures beneath the surface. The size of potential fields, currents and electromagnetics are done to detect surfaces. The principle of work is to inject electrical currents to the ground surface with a pair of electrodes and then a potential difference is measured by other electrodes with different potential measurements, so the rate of resistance from medium can be predicted.",

Electrode currents are used to transmit currents, then in potential electrodes, the voltage will be measured. When the currents are cut suddenly, the price of zero at voltage should occur. However, in reality the decrease in voltage occurs exponentially, between time and time it drops to zero. This effect is called polarized polarization. Energy storage such as mechanical energy, chemistry or electricity can occur as the current continues to flow. The polarization effect can occur because of chemical energy that causes polarized polarization to affect membrane polarization and polarization of electrodes. In this method geophysicists try to find areas where resilience decreases frequently with increased current frequencies applied. Self - potential method or Self Potential Method (SP) is a geophysical method that uses electrical parameters. This method of earth's potential value is used as a measured parameter. These potential fluctuations are relatively constant. This method is often used in monitoring such things as volcanoes, ruptures, streams, exploration and infrastructure; and mappings such as mineral exploration, internal volcanoes, environments and so on. This method has been quite popular since the 20th century until now. The instruments used in this method are Voltmeters with sufficient precision and are able to measure positive and negative potentials; Porous metal pots covered by salt. Electromagnetic methods are often used to view the distribution of physical parameters in the earth's layers with characters that include wavelengths, amplitudes, speeds and frequencies. This method is often used in the exploration of conductive objects or that can conduct electrical heat and provide a magnetic response.

Most phones operate using electrical signals transmissions in telephone networks that enable phone users to communicate with other users. When the phone handle was picked up, the phone position was called off the hook. And then the circuit splits into two lanes, where the positive part will function as Tip, which points to zero, while the negative part will function as the Ring, which shows the number -48V DC. In order to produce sound on the phone, electrical signals are transmitted through telephone cables that are then converted into signals that can be heard by receiver phones. For analog technology, analog signal transmissions sent from central office (CO) will be converted into digital transmissions. The numbers as a phone number constitute a merge between certain tones and frequencies which are then called Dual-tone multi-frequency DTMF and have a Hertz unit. The main link that's in the circuit will be on the hook when it's opened, and then there's the vibration. The sound on the receiver's phone indicates the phone is ready for use. Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) is performed based on a direct link between the sender and the receiver that must use copper wires, fiber optics, satellite, wireless, and mobile wireless circuits. The use of the network involves the basic components of telephone, network access, central office (CO), special stems and circuitry, and customer premise equipment. The PSTN development as a digital telephone system has increased its network capacity and quality so it allows it to use some communication channels in a switch medium.

This new generation of networks uses a number of technologies such as wireless and mobile, fiber and cable, or the updates of existing copper lines. The countries that have adopted this technology are developed countries. Developing countries can adopt this NGN technology by using wireless broadband access to create information technology and communication technology (ICT) to remove obstacles to innovate and invest. In the development of NGN technology, there are two technologies that play on optical transmission based networks, which are SDH and DWDM. The ability to send bandwidth to SDH reaches STM-64 (10 Gbps), while at DWDM is n x 2.5 Gbps or n x 10 Gbps (n is the wavelength number).

Biomoleculars include large macromolecules (or polyanions) such as proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids, as well as small molecules such as primary metabolic, secondary metabolic, and natural products. A more common name for this group is biological matter. The biomolecular is an important element for living organisms, often endogenous, or produced within the organism itself. However, organisms usually require an exogenous biomolecular, such as certain nutrients, to survive. His biology and branch of science, biochemistry and molecular biology, studied his biomolecular and reaction. Most of the biomoleculars are organic compounds and only four elements of a human body's 96% mass are oxygenated, carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen. However, many other elements, such as various biometals, are found in small quantities. The uniformity of these kinds of biomolecular and metabolic pathways is an unchanging feature among the diversity of life-forms; thus, these biomolecular and metabolic pathways are referred to as \"theuniversal biochemical\" or \"the theory of the unity of living materials,\" a concept of union in biology, along with cell theory and evolution theory. There are various kinds of biomolecular, which include small molecules: lipids, fatty acids, glycolipids, sterols, monosacres, vitamins, hormones, neurotransmitters, and metabolic acids; and monomer, olygomer, and polymers like tables below. Monoskarides are the simplest forms of carbohydrates of one sugar. In its structure, monoskarides contain a group of idehidas (the group is called the sin) or a group of ketons (the group is called ketose).

Most of the sacarides are fuel for cellular respiration. Diskarides are formed when two monosocarides form glycocytic bonds by removing water molecules. One molecule is sociable that it can be separated into two molecules of monoskaride through hydrolysis. An example of disoride is sucrosa, maltose, and lactose. Policarides are polysacredly polymerized into complex carbohydrates. These include starch, cellulose, and glycogen. Policacidal molecules are generally large and often have complex connectivity. Shorter polysacrides, with 3 to 10 monomers called oigoskarides. Lipid is generally an ester of fatty acid, and it acts as a basic building material for biological membranes and energy storage (e. g. triglycerides). Most lipids consist of polar or hydrophilic parts of the head (usually glycerol) and the tail parts consist of one to three nonpolar or hydrophobic fatty molecules. Because of these two traits, lipids are referred to as amphiphilic molecules. Fat acid consists of a branchless carbon atomic chain associated with a single bond (this type is called saturated fat acid) or by a single and double bond (this type is called saturated fatty acid). The chain usually consists of 14 to 24 clusters of carbons, and this number is always even. For the lipid on the biological membrane, the hydrophilic head comes from one of three groups: (1) glycolipid, whose head contains an olygosocaride with 1 JURAfida residue; (2) its head contains a positive charged force linked to the tail by a negative phosphate group; or (3) the head, which contains a plantar steroid ring, such as cholesterol.",

In 1871, Germany was founded as a nation, Austria was not part of it. After World War I and the end of Austria's monarchy, politicians declared the name of the new republic \"Deutsch\u00f6sterreich\" and that it was part of the German Republic. The union of the two countries has been banned by the Saint-Germain-en-Laye Testament (1919) as one of the terms of the Allied Block in World War I that won the war against the defeated nation, to prevent the formation of a German country whose territory is widespread. After the events of World War II and Nazism, Austria as a country has sought to establish an Austrian identity among its population, and now most of them do not consider themselves German. Nevertheless, a small part of Austria still feels as Germans and is fighting for the Great Reich, on the grounds that according to its history, the bounds of the German people go beyond the borders of today's country, particularly Austria and Germany. Austria can be described as a national or as a homogeneous German ethnic group, which is closely associated with German neighbors Liechtenstein and Switzerland. Today 91.1% of the population is viewed as Austrian ethnic. Ethnic Turk is the largest group of immigrants in Austria, followed by Serbian ethnics.",

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was born in Salzburg, when it was included in the territory of the Holy Roman Empire, which became part of Austria, and Mozart's many careers were spent in Vienna. Vienna has long been the center of important musical breakthroughs. The 18th and 19th - century composers were attracted to this city for the protection of Wangsa Habsburg, and made Vienna a classic European music center. During the Baroque period, the people of Slavia and Hungary influenced Austria's music. Vienna's status began its rise as a cultural center in the early 16th century, and focused on the surrounding instrument, including the lute. Ludwig van Beethoven spent a good part of his life in Vienna. The current Austrian national anthem, associated with Mozart, was chosen after World War II to replace the traditional Austrian song by Joseph Haydn. Herbert von Karajan was the main conductor of Berliner Philharmoniker for 35 years. He was generally viewed as one of the greatest conductors of the 20th century, and he was the dominant figure in European classical music from the 1960s until his death.

As subdistinguishable from biology and chemistry, biochemistry can be divided into three areas: structural biology, enzymes, and metabolism. Over the last few decades of the 20th century, biochemistry has managed to explain the process of life through these three subdisciplinary sciences. Most of the field of life science is being discovered and developed through methodology and biochemical research. Biochemistry focuses on a basic understanding of chemistry that allows biological molecules to produce processes that occur within living cells and among cells, which in turn are closely related to tissue and organ understanding, as well as structure and function of organisms. Biochemistry is closely related to molecular biology that studies the molecular mechanisms of biological phenomena. Most biochemistry deals with structures, functions, and biological macromolecular interactions, such as proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and lipids. These molecules build cell structures and do a lot of life-related functions. Cell chemistry also depends on the reaction of small molecules and ions. They can be inorganic compounds (e. g. water and metal ions) or organic (e. g. amino acids used to synthesize proteins). The mechanism used by the cell to harness energy from its environment through chemical reactions is known as metabolism. Biochemical findings were applied primarily in medicine, nutrition, and agriculture. In medicine, biochemists investigate the causes and cures of disease.

However, biochemistry as a specific discipline began about the 19th century, or earlier, depending on which aspects of biochemistry were focused. Some believe that biochemistry may have started since the discovery of the enzyme molecule, which is diastage (now called amilase), in 1833 by Anselme Payen, while others considered Eduard Buchner's demonstration of complex biochemistry (now called fermentation on free-cell extract in 1897 as a sign of the birth of biochemistry. Some may also point to a work of influence published in 1842 by Justus von Liebig, animal chemistry, or, organic chemistry in its application on physiology and pathology, which presented a chemical theory about metabolism, as a start of biochemistry, or even since the 18th century study of fermentation and respiration by Antoine Lavoisier. Many other pioneers are referred to as founders of modern biochemistry because it helps uncover the complexity of biochemistry. Emil Fischer, who studied protein chemistry, and F. Gowland Hopkins, who studied enzymes and dynamic biochemical properties, represented two early biochemists. The term \"bichemical\" itself comes from a combination of biology and chemistry. In 1877, Felix Hoppe-Seyler used this term (biochemic in German) as a synonym for physiological chemistry in introduction to the first edition of Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physiologistche Chemie (Jurnal Chemical Physiological) when he suggested setting up an institution dedicated to this study.

Since then, biochemistry has advanced, especially since the middle of the 20th century with new engineering developments such as chromatography, X-ray diffraction, double polarization interferometry, NMR spectrocopy, radioisotop labeling, electron microscopes, and molecular dynamic simulations. These techniques allow more profound discoveries and analysis of various molecules and cell metabolic pathways, such as glycolysis and the Krebs cycle, and lead to understanding of biochemistry at molecular levels. The development of new sciences such as bioinformatics also helps greatly in the forecast and modeling of giant molecular structures. Another important historical event in biochemistry is the discovery of genes and their role in transferring information inside cells. In the 1950s, James D. Watson, Francis Crick, Rosalind Franklin, and Maurice Wilkins played an important role in the discovery of DNA structure and showed connections with genetic information transfers.

Monoskarides can switch between a funlic (open chain) and a cyclic form.

A well - known type of dyscharide is sucrosa, also known as cane sugar. One molecule of sucrosa consists of one molecule of glucose and one molecule of fructose.

In triglycerides, the main group is mostly lipid, there's one molecule of glycerol and three molecules of fatty acid. In this case, fatty acid is a monomer and may be saturated (not having a bond in its carbon chain) or unsatisfied (having one or more bonds in its carbon chain).",

        "paragraph": "Although generally nonpolar, the majority of lipids also have some polar properties. Most of the structures are nonpolar or hydrophobic, whereas other parts of the structure are polar or hydrophilic. This makes lipids an amphiphiphilic molecule. In cholesterol, the polar clusters are \u25aaOH (hydroxyl or alcohol). In phospholids, the polar clusters are much larger and more polar. Lipid is an integral part of everyday food. Most of the oil and dairy products used to cook and eat like butter, cheese, samin oil, and such are made up of fat. Nabati oil is rich in multiple unsatied fatty acids (PUFA). The food that contains lipid undergoes digestion in the body and is broken down into fatty acid and glycerol, which is the final product of fat and lipid degradation. Lipid, especially phospholipid, is also used in various pharmaceutical products, either as a joint solvent (for example in parential IV) or as a drug - carrying component (for example, in a liposom or transfersom). Proteins are a huge molecule (biopolimer macro) composed of monomeres called amino acids. There are 20 standard amino acids, each of which consists of carbon atoms that bond with four clusters, which are amino clusters (-NH2), carboxyleic acid clusters (-COOH; although this group also exists as -NH3+ and -COO - in physiological conditions), simple hydrogen atoms, and side chains (usually represented as \"-R\"). It's this cluster of \"R\" that makes each amino acid different, and the side chain's properties very much affect the three-dimensional shape of a protein. Some amino acids have their own function, for example glutamate acts as a neurotransmitter. A number of amino acids can be combined by the peptide bond through dehydrated synthesis.",

        "paragraph": "In this process, water molecules will be released and the peptide bond connects nitrogen from one amino cluster on an amino acid to the carbon from the carboxylic acid cluster to another amino acid. The resulting molecule is called dipptide. A short series of amino acids (usually less than thirty) is called peptides or polypedes. Longer circuits are called proteins. For example, the albumin protein in the blood plasma consists of 585 amino acid residues. Proteins have structural and/or functional roles. For example, the movements of actin and miosin proteins play a major role in the contraction of skeleton muscles. One trait that many proteins have is that they bind certain molecules or groups of molecules specifically and may be very selective. Antibodys are examples of proteins that can only bind one type of molecule. One of the most important types of proteins is enzymes. The enzyme molecule can only recognize one type of reactant molecule, referred to as a substrate. The enzyme will catalyze the reaction so that the activation energy will decrease and the reaction rate can last up to 101 times faster or more. A reaction might take 3,000 years to completely complete, but with an enzyme his reaction may become less than a second. The enzyme itself is not used in the reaction process so it immediately catalyzes other substrates. Protein structure can be explained through four levels. Primary structure of proteins consists of linear sequences of amino acids, for example, \"lain-glisin-triptofan-serin-glutmat-asparagin-glisin-lisin-...\" Secondary structure has more to do with local morphology. Some combinations of amino acids would tend to form a scroll called alpha fluid or a sheet called beta sheets. The tersier structure is a whole three-dimensional form of protein.",

For example, the hemoglobin alpha chain consists of 146 amino acid residues; if the glutamate residue in sixth place is replaced by the valin, the hemoglobin properties will change and cause sickle cell anemia. Finally, the quartener structure relates to a protein structure with several peptide subunits, such as hemoglobin with its four subunits. Not all proteins have more than one subunit. Proteins that enter the body will be broken down into amino acids or dipptides in the fine intestines, and then they can be absorbed by the body. Eventually, these amino acids can rejoin to form new proteins. The product between glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and the phosphate path of pentose can be used to form twenty different amino acids. Most bacteria and plants have all the enzymes necessary to synthesize them. Humans and other mammals can only synthesize some of those 20 kinds of aminos. Their bodies cannot synthesize isoleusin, leusin, lisin, metionin, fenilalanin, treonin, triptofan, and valin. Because it has to be obtained from the outside of the body, these amino acids are essential amino acids. Mammals have enzymes to synthesize nonessential amino acids, that is, alin, asparagine, aspartat, sistein, glutamat, glutamin, glysin, prolin, serin, and tirosin. Arginin and histidin can also be synthesized by mammals, but can only be produced in limited amounts so that sometimes it is also referred to as essential amino acids. If the amino group is released from an amino acid, then it leaves behind a carbon skeleton called keto-cour. Transaminase enzymes can easily move an amino cluster of one amino acid into another keto-toxinic acid (make it an amino acid).",

So amino acids can be combined to form proteins. Similar processes are used to break proteins. First of all, proteins will be hydrolyzed into the components, which are amino acids. The free Ammonia (NH3) that exists in ammonium ion (NH4+) in the blood will be dangerous to the body and therefore must be expelled. Uniseluler organisms just have to release this ammonia out of the body. The same is true boned fish that can release ammonia into fast diluted water. In general, mammals convert ammonia into urea, through the urea cycle. To determine whether two proteins are interconnected, or in other words to decide whether they are homologous or not, scientists use a method of comparison sequences. Methods such as alignment of sequences and structural alignments are a powerful way that helps scientists identify homology among related molecules. Besides knowing the pattern of protein family evolution, the discovery of homology is also to identify the resemblance of two proteins and its structure and function. The nucleic acid is a complex biochemical macromolecule and has a high molecular weight, which can transmit genetic information in all living cells and viruses. The name nucleic acid was given because it was originally found in the nucleus (though also found in mitochondria and chloroplasts). The monomer is called nucleotide and each consists of three components: nitrogen heterocyclic bases (both purin or pyridin), sugar pentose (sugar with five carbon atoms), and phosphate groups. The most common nucleic acid is deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA). The phosphate and sugar clusters of each nucleotides are bound together to form a nucleic acid called \"edit,\" whereas the nitrogen base sequence determines the genetic information it holds.",

Adenine pairs with thymine and thyrasil, thymine pairs only with adenine, while cytosine and guanine can only pair with each other. In addition to the genetic material of the cell, nucleic acids also often play a second messenger, as well as a basic adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a primary energy - carrying molecule found in all living organisms. The types of nitrogen bases found in DNA and RNA differ: adenine, cytosine, and guanin are found both in DNA and RNA, thymine is only present in DNA, and rasil only exists in RNA. Glucose is the main source of energy for most living things. For example, polycaciacs will be broken down into monomer-monomeres (fosforilase glycogen will remove glucose residue from glycogen). Coordinates such as lactose or sucroses will be broken into two components of its monosacred. Glucose is primarily metabolized by metabolic pathways called glycolysis. This process consists of 10 steps that if simplifyed aim to break one molecule of glucose into two molecules of pyruvate acid. At the end of glycolysis came two ATP molecules as well as a change in NAD+ (nikotinamida adenina dinukleotide: oxidized form) to NADH (nikotinamida adenina dinukleotide: form is reduced). Glycolysis doesn't need oxygen. If no oxygen supply (or cell cannot use oxygen), NAD is restored by converting pyruvate into lactic acid (e.g. human) or into ethanol and carbon dioxide (e. g. on leaven). Other monoskarides such as galactose and fructose can be converted into substances between in the path of glycolysis. In aerobal respiration when the cell gets enough oxygen, the pyruvate acid produced from glycolysis will be re-absorbed and converted into Ko-A acetyl.",

Energy in NADH and FADH2 will later be used in electron transport. This energy is used in a gradual way by releasing electrons and H+ from NADH and FADH2 in the electron transport system. The electron transport system will pump H+ out of the membrane in mitochondria. The concentration of H+ outside the membrane in the mitochondria will cause the proton gradient, so H+ will reenter the membrane in the mitochondria through ATP synthane. Oxygen serves as the final electron receiver, so the ATP formation continues. Oxygen associated with H+ will form water. NAD+ and FAD will be reused in respiration systems, as previously explained. This is why we breathe oxygen and release carbon dioxide. In 1 molecule of glucose will be produced a total of 36 ATPs, and one ATP can release 7.3 kilocalories. In the body of the vertebrates, a hard-working urinal muscle (e. g. when lifting weights or running) will not get enough oxygen so it will perform anaerobal metabolism, which will turn glucose into lactic acid. The liver will reproduce the glucose, through a process called gluoneogenesis. The gluoneogenesis process actually requires three times as much energy as it does in the glycolysis process (there are 6 ATPs made, while glycolysis produces only 2 ATPs).

Wheat is usually used to produce wheat flour, livestock feed, or fermentation to produce alcohol. Generally speaking, ocular wheat grains are of an opal length of 61'8 \"sm\" and 6\"3 mm in diameter. Like other types of cereals, wheat has a hard texture. The wheat grain consists of three parts of the skin (bran), part endosperma, and part of the institution (germ). Prehistoric society already knows the properties of wheat and other grain crops as a source of food. According to archaeological excavations, it is estimated that wheat came from areas around the Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea, areas surrounding Turkey, Syria, Iraq, and Iran. China's history indicates that wheat cultivation has existed since 2700 B.C.E. Wheat is a basic human food, livestock and industrial materials that use carbohydrates as the raw materials. Wheat can be classified based on the texture of wheat grain (kernel), the color of seed skin (bran), and the season of planting. Based on the texture of the kernel, wheat is classified as hard wheat, soft wheat, and durum wheat. Meanwhile, based on the color of bran, wheat is classified as red wheat and white wheat. For the harvest season, wheat is divided into winter wheat and spring wheat. In general, though, wheat is classified as hard wheat, soft wheat and durum wheat. The astivum triticum is the world's most grown wheat species and is widely used as a breadmaking material because it has high protein levels.

The triticum durum is a special type of wheat. The characteristic of this wheat is the yellow (endosperma) inside, not white, like the common type of wheat and it has harder seeds, and it has a brown skin. This type of wheat is used to make pasta products, such as macoonries, spaghetti, and other pasta products. For the most part, the kernel is shaped of 6 inches long and 2,3 mm in diameter. Like other types of cereals, wheat has a hard texture. The wheat grain consists of three parts of the skin (bran), part endosperma, and part of the institution (germ). The skin part of the wheat seed is not easily separated because it is a single unit of wheat seeds but it is usually separated by milling. Bran is the skin outside the wheat and is 14.5% of the whole grain. Bran is made up of five layers of epidermis (3.9%), epicarp (0.9%), endokarp (0.9%), testta (0.6%), and alteuron (9%). Bran has greater granulation than a pollard, and he has protein content and high fiber levels so that cattle are both consumed.

There's also an ash substance that gets smaller when it gets close to the nucleus and it gets bigger when it gets closer to the skin. The institution is found in grains of 2.5-3%. The Society is a high - fat food reserve and has a part where cells are still alive even after harvesting. Around the surviving parts are few molecules of glucose, minerals, proteins, and enzymes.

Sadly, though, in the production of wheat flour, the essence of wheat was removed at the time of the cleansing of wheat seeds. This is because it is high in the essence of wheat so that it prevents flour from being oxidized easily, insiduous and preserved when stored.

Floured flour is obtained from mills of wheat that experience several stages of processing. Several stages of processing are the preparatory and milling stages. The preparatory stage includes cleaning, rounding, and watering. At the cleansing stage, wheat is cleansed of dirt like dust, other grains besides grain, soybeans, wheat bark, wheat stalks, stones, pebbles, metals, and so forth. The contaminants must be separated from the wheat before the mill process. The use of crude and magnetism can separate foreign objects and the metal substance found in wheat. Small contamination requires special treatment to separate it from wheat. The wheat that has been cleared goes through the next process, which is the moisturizing and liquidation process. The rounding process is a process of adding water so that the mixture of wheat has the desired water level. The process of rounding depends on the water content of wheat, density, and the violence of wheat seeds. The amount of water added can be calculated mathematically by using the equation: W is the amount of water added (kg), M2 is the desired water level (%), M1 is the initial grain water level (%), and Q is the grain weight (kg). After going through the process of rounding up, the wheat has been desiccated by adding water to the wheat and being silenced for a period of time so that the water actually sinks.

The next stage of milling is the process of reduction, which is the already crushed endosperma, reduced into flour, for the next time sifted to be separated from bran and pollard. During the milling process were produced by side products such as bracks, pollards, pellets, and industrial flour. The goal of this mill stage is to obtain high extracts with good quality of flour.

The humidity ranges from 70 to 90%. The major factor that affects the Indonesian climate is, not air temperature or air pressure, but precipitation. The variation of the season in Indonesia, which is the rainy season and the dry season, is related to the movement of the muson wind. West muson winds that blew from Asia to Australia through Indonesia in October to February result in high rainfall, especially in western Indonesia. Meanwhile, the east muson winds are moving in the opposite direction in April to August with little moisture and rain. In addition, there is a transitional season when the sun crosses the equator, causing the wind to blow weak and to move erratically. Nevertheless, not all Indonesian regions have the same pattern of rainfall.

Kagyud's tree begins with the Great Mahasiddha of Tilopa (988-1069), one of India's 84 great mahisidhas, who first developed spontaneous insights. This achievement gained through a method taught by the Sakyamini Buddha only to his closest pupils. Tilopa herself is not an ordinary human being. When Tilopa was young, there was a creepy-looking Dakini who appeared before him. Tilopa asked for his status, origin and family, and this Dakini replied: \u25aa Your country is Udiyana, your father is Chakrasamvara, your mother is Vajrayogini. Tilopa then passed down the genealogical line of Kagyu (1016-1100) and passed on to Marpa Lotsawa (1012-1097), continuing to Milarepa (1052-1135) a well - known yogi in Tibet, who reached enlightenment in 1 life (Milarepa originally was a very tall Bon-talist, who had killed the village by creating a large rock and dropping it from the sky, and created a scorpion and bracelet as big as a house). Milarepa received enlightenment under the harsh guidance of her teacher, Marpa Lotsawa. Because of great tenacity and devotion to Dharma, Milarepa trained hard, relentlessly every second, to the point of not thinking about eating and other worldly things. By paying attention to the thoughts that arise, removing all inner stains, finally Milarepa was able to attain enlightenment in just one life and have countless supernatural abilities. Milarepa passed the genealogical down to Gampopa (1079-1153), which was then passed down to Karmapa I \u25aa Dusum Kyenpa (1110-1193) and continues to the present day to Karmapa XVII - Trinley Thaye Dorje (born in 1983).",

Democritos developed the thought of atoms that led to the more well - known Democritos thought in the history of philosophy. Besides being a philosopher, Democritos is also known for mastering many skills. Unfortunately, Democritos' work is not stored. Democritos wrote about science, astronomy, mathematics, literature, epistemology, and ethics. There are about 300 quotes of Democritos' thinking inside ancient sources. Most of those quotes are about ethics. Democritos was born in the city of Abdera, North Greece. He lived about 460 B.C.E. to 370 B.C.E. He came from a wealthy family. When he was young, he used his inheritance to travel to Egypt and other Eastern lands. Besides becoming Leukippos' disciples, he also studied with Anaxagoras and Philolaos. There's little to be known about Democritos' history. A lot of data about his life has been mixed up with legends whose truth is hard to believe. Although he was a contemporary of Socrates, even younger, Democritos was still classified as a pre-socratic philosopher. This is because he went on and developed the teaching of atomicism of Leukippos which is a pre-socratic philosopher. The teachings of Leukippos and Democritos can hardly be separated. Moreover, Democritos philosophy was not known in Athens for long. For example, Plato knew nothing about Atomism. Aristotle then took great note of the view of atomicism. Democritos and his teacher, Leukippos, argue that atoms are the elements that make up reality. Here, they agree with the teaching of Empedocles pluralism and Anaxagoras that reality consists of many elements, not one. However, contrary to Empedocles and Anaxagoras, Democritos thought that these elements could no longer be divided.",

The atoms differ from the others through three things: they're like letter A different than N), they're in sequence (like An is different from NA), and they're positioned (A is different from Z in alphabetical order). Thus, atoms have sheer quantity, including mass. The number of atoms that make up this reality is endless. Furthermore, atoms are also viewed as unmade, indestructible, and unchanging. What happens to atoms is motion. Therefore, Democritus stated that \"the fundamental principles of the universe are atoms and voids.\" If there's empty space, then those atoms can move. Democritus compared atomic motion to a situation when sunlight entered a pitch-dark room through the cracks of a window. It'll show how the dust moves through all the directions, even though there's no wind to cause it to move. Thus, it doesn't take any other principle to make the atoms move, like the principles of \"love\" and \"hate\" according to Empedocles. There's enough empty space to make those atoms move. The world and all of reality are created because different atoms are intertwined with each other.

These atoms are driven by tiny images of an object called the eidola. Thus comes the impression of senses over these objects. It has previously been said that every object, composed of atoms, emits a small picture called the eidola. It's these images that go into the human senses and are channeled into the soul. People can see because these little images are in touch with the soul atoms. Such a process applies to all other kinds of senses recognition. And what about the quality accepted by the human senses, like bitter, sweet, color, etcetera? According to the Democritos these atoms don't have quality, so where do people feel those qualities? According to Democritos, such qualities result in contact between certain atoms and others. For example, humans feel sweet because the atoms of the soul come in contact with slippery atoms. Then humans feel bitter when souls come into contact with rough atoms. The heat is acquired because the soul is in contact with atoms that are moving at high speeds. Democritos thus conclude that these qualities are felt only by subjects and not by actual objects. For this reason, Democritos claims that humans cannot recognize the true nature of an object. All that can be observed is the symptoms or sightings of the object. Democritos says: According to Democritos, the highest value in human life is a perfect inner state (euthymia). When man balances the measure (of good and evil), The one in charge of working this balance is the ratio. Untranslated articles can be removed quickly according to the A2 criteria.",

The alchemy can be viewed as a classic of modern chemistry before it was formulated by scientific method.n 1) The word alchemy comes from Arabic al-kimiya or al-khimiya, meaning \"printing together,\" \"polling together,\" \"aloy,\" and so on (from hument, \"which is poured out, metal stems\"). Another etymology links this word to the word \"Al Kemi,\" which means \"Egyptian Art,\" because the ancient Egyptians called their country \"Mami\" and were viewed as a magical wizard throughout the ancient world. Most people view alchemists as pseudoscience experts who seek to turn lead into gold, believing that all matter is made up of four elements of soil, air, fire, and water, and possessing mystical and magical water. From a modern point of view, their efforts and beliefs are considered to have limited validity. But not in the context of their times. They tried to explore and investigate nature before the vast majority of basic scientific tools and practices were available, and instead depended on digitation, tradition, basic observations, and mysticism to fill these holes. To understand alchemists, try to reflect on how miraculous the transformation of a substance becomes another substance, which has been the basis for metallurgy since the beginning of this science at the end of Neolithum, for cultures that do not understand physics or chemistry formally.",

At that time, physics that had no metaphysic insight was considered incomplete as metaphysics had no physical manifestation. Thus, symbols and processes of alchemy usually have both an inner meaning that refers to the spiritual development of its practitioners, as well as the material meaning associated with the physical changes of matter. A common metal transmutation into gold symbolizes an effort toward perfection or the highest height of existence. Alchemists believe that the entire universe is moving toward perfect conditions; and gold, as never broken, is considered the most perfect substance. By trying to turn ordinary metals into gold, they're actually trying to help the universe. So, it's logical to think that by understanding the secrets of the unchanging gold, they'll find the key to preventing organic disease and decay; that's the link between chemical, spiritual, and astrological themes into medieval alchemical features. Hence, the naive interpretation of some alchemists, or false expectations promoted by others, must not reduce the value of the more sincere efforts of other practitioners. Moreover, the field of alchemy has changed a lot throughout the ages, starting as a branch of metallurgy, becoming an adult into a rich and legitimate field of study, evolved into mysticism and blunt deception, and eventually gave some basic empirical knowledge for modern chemistry and medicine. Until the 18th century, alchemy was considered a serious science in Europe; for example, Isaac Newton devoted much time to this art. Another major alchemist in the Western world is Roger Bacon, Saint Thomas Aquinas, Tycho Brahe, Thomas Browne, and Parmigianino. The decline of alchemy began in the 18th century with the birth of modern chemistry, which provided a more meticulous and reliable framework for transmutation of substances and drugs, in the new design of the universe based on rational materialism.",

More recently, reports of transmutation of the upper elements by electrolysis or cavitation of the voice became the center of cold fusion controversy in 1989. None of these claims can be duplicated. In both of these cases, the necessary conditions are far beyond the reach of ancient alchemists. Alchemical mining was once used in the 20th century by psychologists and philosophers. Carl Jung rechecked mining and alchemy theory and began to show inner meaning in the work of alchemy as a spiritual path. Philosophy, symbols, and alchemy methods enjoy the rebirth in the context of posmodern, such as the New Age movement. Even some physicists are messing with the idea of alchemy in books like The Tao of Physics and The Dancing Wu Li Masters. The history of alchemy has become an active academic field. As the language of the obscure alchemist and of course hermetics can slowly be \"discrypted,\" historical scholars have become increasingly aware of the intellectual connections between alchemy and other aspects of Western cultural history, such as Rosicucan society and other mystical societies, magic, and of course evolution of science and philosophy. Alchemy includes some philosophy traditions that spread over four thousand years and three continents, and their general interest in coded languages and mining makes it difficult for us to track down things that affect and their \"genetic\" relationships.

The alchemy in the Western world and other places that practice it widely are related and closely associated with traditional Greek-Babilonian astrology; in many ways, alchemy and astrology were built to complement one another in search of magical knowledge. Traditionally, every seven planets in the solar system known to the people of the age are intertwined with, overpowered, and regulated certain metals. Since Isaac Newton was a well - known alchemist in his day, astrology and alchemy (even today) were so closely linked, perhaps Newton once had a good knowledge of astrology, or at least a basic understanding of the astrology methodology associated with alchemy. Logically, then, a person must have learned a lot about astrology in order to use alchemy effectively, and Newton and other leading alchemists must have known this. While Western alchemy finally centers on common metal transmutation into glorious metals, the relationship between Chinese alchemy and medicine is more noticeable. A European philosopher's philosopher's rock can be compared to the Grand Elixir of Immorality the Chinese alchemists are looking for. In hermetic view, however, these two goals do not stand alone, and philosophical stones are often compared with universal panacea. These two traditions may thus have more in common than they were originally predicted. Black powder may be the most important creation of Chinese alchemists.

In other words, the human body (microcosm) is influenced by the outside world, which includes the heavens through astrology, and the earth through elements.

In essence, he felt that sense and faith could be used to understand God, but experimental philosophy was bad: \"In the soul also exists, through this sense of the body, this kind of empty desire and curiosity that aims not to enjoy the body, but to gain experience through the body, and this empty curiosity is respected in the name of learning and science.\" Augustinian's idea was clearly against experiments, but when experimental Aristotelian techniques were available to the Western world, they were not rejected. Yet, Augustinian's thinking had already bled in medieval society and was used to blame alchemy as ungodliness. In the end, at the end of the Middle Ages, this flow of thought created a permanent gap, which separated the alchemy from the religion that encouraged its birth. The vast majority of Roman knowledge of alchemy, as Greek and Egyptian knowledge is now lost. In Alexandria, at the center of an alchemy study in the Roman Empire, the art was delivered from mouth to mouth and to maintain secrecy, only a few were written. (Since then the word \"hermetic\" means \"secret\"). There may have been some written in Alexandria, and then it was lost or burned in times of turmoil after that. After the collapse of the Roman Empire, the focus of alchemy moved to the Middle East. What is known about Islamic alchemy is much more because the documentation is better: in fact, most of the writings that have been handed down over the years are energized in the form of Islamic translations.",

Islam's Alchemist Abu Bakr Muhammad bin Zakariya al-Razi (Rasis or Rhazes in Latin) also contributed important chemical discoveries, such as distillation techniques (words of alembic and alcohol also derived from Arabic), chloride acid, sulfuric acid, and nitrate acid, al-narun, and al-kaline that formed names for elements of sodium and potassium and many more. The discovery that the king's water or aqua regia, a mixture of nitric acid with chloride acid, can dissolve the gold's mighty metals, is a discovery that fuels the imagination of the alchemists over the next thousand years. Islamic philosophers also made a huge contribution to alchemy hermeticism. The most influential writer in this regard is Jabir bin Hayyan. The primary goal of the Jabir is to unwin, the artificial creation of living beings in the lab of alchemicals, up and including humans. He analyzed every element of Aristotelian, hot, cold, dry, and damp. According to the twister, in each metal, these two traits are inside and two are outside. For example, the lead was cold and dry outside, while the gold was hot and damp. So, theorized twist, by reorganizing the properties of a metal, could produce other metals. With this reasoning, the search for philosopher stones was introduced in Western alchemy. It develops complex numerology, which is the letter of the name of an Arabic substance, if transformed, will relate to the physical nature of the element. It is now widely accepted that Chinese alchemy affects Arabic alchemists, although to what extent the influence is still debated.",

Because of their strong relationship with Greek and Roman cultures, alchemy was easily adopted by Christian philosophy, and medieval European alchemists expanded its absorption of Islamic alchemy. Gerbert of Aurillac, who later became Pope Silvester II, (dead 1003) was one of the first to bring Islamic science to Europe from Spain. The figure after that is like Adelard from Bath, who lived in the 12th century, bringing additional knowledge. But up until the 13th century those movements were mainly assimilative. During this period there were some irregularities in Augustinian principles from early Christian thinkers. Saint Anselm (1033\u25aa1109) was a Benedictine (St. Benedict) who believed that belief should precede rationalism, as Augustine and most theologians did before Anselm believed, but Anselm was more convinced that faith and rationalism were compatible and that he encouraged rationalism in the Christian context. His views prepare for the explosion of philosophy. Saint Abelard, a believer by Anselm, laid the basis for the acceptance of Aristotelian thinking before Aristotle's first works reached the Western world. The big impact on alchemy is his belief that the Platonic universe has no separate existence beyond human consciousness. Abelard also systemsiatically analyzed philosophical contradictions. Robert Grossete (1170 JULI 1253) was a pioneer of scientific theories that later were used and polished by chemists. He took Abelard's method of analysis and added the use of observation, experiment and conclusion in making scientific evaluations. Grossete also bridged the thought of Platonic and Aristotelian. Albertus Magnus (1193 JULI 1280) and Thomas Aquinas (1225 JUNI1274) were both Dominican followers who studied Aristotle and sought to reconcile the gap between philosophy and Christianity.",

Furthermore, he claimed that the universe could be known only through logical thinking: it was contrary to Platonic belief generally held that the universe could only be known through divine inspiration. Magnus and Aquinas were among the first to test alchemical theories, and they could also be considered as alchemists, with the exception that they did very little experiment. One of Aquinas ' main contributions was the belief that since the mind of the mind would not be in harmony with God's will, then the mind's mind certainly conforms to theology. The first true alchemist in medieval Europe was Roger Bacon. His work on alchemy was as much as Robert Boyle produced for chemistry and Galileo Galilei for astronomy and physics. Bacon (1214\u25aa1294) is Oxford Fransiscan who explores optical science and languages other than alchemy. The Fransisian idea of taking part in the world instead of rejecting the world brought it to the belief that experimentation is more important than thought: \"In three ways in which humans feel that they are gaining knowledge: authority (because it is their right), thinking, experience; then only the last one that is effective and able to reconcile common sense.\" \"Experiodal science is mastering the conclusions of all fields of science. He reveals the truth where the evidence of the common laws was not found before.\" Roger Bacon also known as the starter of the philosopher's stone search and the elixir of life: \"It will remove all filth and vices from some metals, in its wisdom, eliminating many of the evil traits may have been in the human body for centuries.\" The idea of immortality was replaced by the idea of a long life; after all, human life on Earth was just waiting and preparing for immortality in God's world.",

His works were used by countless alchemists from the fifteenth to the nineteenth century. Other alchemists in the Bacon period had some similar characteristics. First, and most clearly, that is almost all members of the priesthood. Simply put, it's because a few people outside the parishional school are learning a lesson that studies the derivatives of Arabic works. Also, the alchemy of this time was approved by the church as a good method of exploring and developing theology. Alchemy was also of interest to the church people because it offered a rationalistic view of the universe in which humans had just begun to learn about rationalism. So at the end of the thirteenth century, alchemy developed into a almost structured belief system. Experts believe in the macrocosmos theory of the Hermes, which means that they believe that the process that affects minerals and other substances will also affect the human body (for example, if one can learn the secret of the golden purification, then he can apply the technique to purify the human soul. They believe in the four elements and the four qualities that have been described above, and they have a strong tradition of wrapping their writing ideas into a concise jargon maze, full of confusing traps. Alchemists practice their art: they actively experiment with chemicals and make observations and theories on how the universe works. Their whole philosophy revolved around their belief that the human soul had been separated inside humans since Adam's fall. By purifying those two souls, humans can once again become one with God.",

William of Ockham, an Oxford Franciscan who died in 1349, attacked the Thomist's view of the harmony between faith and thought. His view, accepted widely now, is that God is simply accepted through faith; he cannot be limited by human thinking. Of course this view is not wrong if one receives a postulate about God's infinity versus the limitations of human thinking, but this in effect eliminates the practice of alchemy in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Pope John XXII in early 1300 issued a fatwa against alchemy, where the result was to rid the church of all church personnel from the practice of Art. The changing climate, Black Plague, and the increase in wars and famines that mark this century, no doubt have also hindered the search for philosophy in general. Alchemicals were kept alive by people like Nicolas Flamel, who were to be reckoned because he was among the few alchemists who wrote at those difficult times. Flamel, who lived from 1330 to 1417, was a basic pattern maker (archetype) of the next stage of alchemy. He wasn't as religious as most of his predecessors, and his whole interest in the subject surrounding the search for philosophers, where he was thought to have found it; his works spent a lot of time with descriptions of processes and reactions, but never really gave the formula for transmutation. Most of his works were intended to gather the knowledge of alchemy that had existed before, especially those associated with philosopher rocks. During the medieval end (1300-1500) the alchemists were mostly like Flamel: they concentrated on the search for philosophers and young medicine (elixir of youth), which is now believed to be two separate things.

These were considered magicians by most people, and often tortured for their practical practices. Tycho Brahe, better known for his investigation of astronomy and astrology, was also an alchemist. He had a lab built for that purpose at the Uraniborg observatory institute. One of those whose name appeared early in the sixteenth century was Heinrich Cornelius Agappa. This alchemist believes he's a witch, in the sense that he actually thinks he's capable of summoning the occult. His influence was insignificant, but just like Flamel, he produced writings that became a reference to the alchemists years later. Again, like Flamel, he did much to convert alchemy from mystical philosophy to occult magic. He continued the philosophy of former alchemists, including experimental sciences, numerology etc., but he added magic theories, which strengthened the idea of alchemy as an occult belief. Nevertheless, Agruppa is still a Christian, although his views often conflict with the church. European alchemy continued this way until the rise of the Renaissance. The era also witnessed the proliferation of con artists who used chemical and magic tricks to \"demonstrate\" common metal transmutation into gold, or who claimed to have a secret knowledge with the original capital \"little\" of it would have achieved that goal. The most important name of the time is Philippus Aureolus Paracelsus (Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim, 1493:1541) which has printed a new form of alchemy, rejecting some of the occult that has been standing by for years, promoting the use of observation and experiments to study the human body.",

In particular, Paracelsus rejected the magical theories of Agruppa and Flamel. He doesn't consider himself to be a witch, and condemns those who claim to be. Paracelsus pioneered the use of chemicals and minerals in medicine, and wrote \"Many people say that alchemy is intended to make gold and silver. For me, the purpose of alchemy is not that, but to learn the good and the power contained in medicine.\" The hermetic view is that disease and body health depend on the harmony between human microcosm and the macrokosm's natural nature. He took a different approach to his predecessors, using this analogy not in order to purify-the soul, but in order that man should have a certain mineral balance in his body, and that certain body diseases can be cured with certain medications. While his efforts to treat disease with a drug such as mercury may seem wrong from a modern point of view, his basic ideas about chemical drugs have proved time - tested. In Britain, the topic of age alchemy is often associated with Doctor John Dee (July 13, 1527, December 1608), better known as astrologers, cryptaries, and \"scientific Consultant\" for Queen Elizabeth I. Dee was viewed as an expert in the works of Roger Bacon, and was quite interested in alchemy, thus writing a book on this topic (Mos Hierlyphica, 1564) with the influence of the Kabala.

He assumed that air contained oxygen, 170 years before Scheele and Priestley, by warming the nitre (saltpetre). He thinks of the gas he produces as a \"living drink.\" The end of Western alchemy is caused by the rise of modern science, which emphasizes experiments that are just as precise and take the \"old wisdom\" for granted. Although these seeds were planted in the early 17th century, alchemy continued well for two hundred years, in fact he may have reached the furthest point of his apogee in the 18th century. Late 1781 James Price claims to have produced powder that could transmutate mercury into silver or gold. Robert Boyle (1627\u25aa1691), better known for his study of gas (cf. Boyle law) pioneered scientific methods in chemical investigations. He had no assumptions in his experiments and he compiled any relevant data; in an experiment, Boyle would record the places where experiments took place, the characteristics of the wind, the position of the sun and the moon, and the barometer numbers, in case they proved relevant. This approach eventually led to the formation of modern chemistry in the 18th and 19th centuries, based on the revolutionary discoveries of Lavoisier and John Dalton \u25aa which eventually provided logical, quantitative and reliable framework for understanding material transmutations, and the failure of long-lasting alchemy goals such as fisuf. Meanwhile, the alchemy of Paracelsian leads to the development of modern medicine. Experimentalists gradually discovered how the human body works, such as the circulation (Harvey, 1616), and at one time found that many diseases were caused by germ infections (Koch and Pasteur, 19th century) or lack of vitamins and natural nutrients.",

So, when science continued to break the veil and rationalize the time machine of the universe, yeng was built on its own materialistic metaphysics, alchemy was removed from its relationship with chemistry and medicine but was still burdened by it. Alchemy is reduced to a philosophy system that is considered difficult to understand, weak in its relationship with the material world, it experiences a fate similar to that of other esoteric disciplines such as Astrology and Kabbalah: expelled from the curriculum, avoided by former supporters, exiled by scientists, and generally viewed as symbols of culture and superstition. These developments can be interpreted as part of a broader reaction within European intellectualism against the Romantic movement of the previous century. Perhaps it would be wise to examine how a discipline of science that once gained intellectual and material dignity, over two thousand years, could easily vanish from Western thinking. Many authors denounce the alchemist and use it as a laughingstock. The Alchemist's play by Ben Johnson is famous. In Harry Potter's children's book, the \"rock of philosophy\" is mentioned. This stone was created by the alchemists in J.K. Rowling's creation world. This rock can turn any metal into pure gold, and create a drink of life that keeps its drinkers alive forever.

These constant conditions include variables, such as body temperature and balance of bodily fluids, which are kept within the predetermined limits (called homeostasis range). Other variable examples are pH extracellular fluid, sodium ion concentration, potassium, and calcium, and blood sugar levels. These things need to be kept in spite of environment, diet, and body activity constantly changing. Each of these variables is controlled by one or several mechanisms that together sustain life. When a thing is already in optimal condition, homeostasis emerges as a natural resistance to change. Balanced conditions are maintained and regulated by many mechanisms. All the mechanisms that control homeostasis have at least three interdependent components, which are receptors, centers of control, and effectors, each of which are owned for every variable arranged. Receptors are sensing components that monitor and respond to environmental changes both external and internal. Receptors include temperature receptors and mechanical receptors. The control center, for example, is a respiratory center and an anangiotensity-recording system. The effector is an actionable target so that changes are returned to normal state. The concept of internal environmental settings is explained by French physiologist Claude Bernard in 1849, while the word homeostasis was created by Walter Bradford Cannon in 1926. In 1932 Joseph Barcroft, a British physiologist, said that the higher brain functions require the most stable internal environment. For Barcroft, homeostasis is not only regulated by the brain but also serves the brain.

The word homeostasis itself combines the new Latin word from the ancient Greek: Metabolic processes in all organisms can only occur in very specific physical and chemical environments. Conditions vary in each organism and depend whether chemical processes take place inside the cell or in the interstitial fluid that fills the cell. The mammal's best - known homeostasis mechanism is the regulator that keeps the composition of extracellular fluid (or \"internal environments\") constant, especially those associated with temperature, pH, osmolality, and concentration of sodium, potassium, glucose, carbon dioxide, and oxygen. There are many other homeostasis mechanisms that govern various aspects of the body's physiology. When a variable level is higher or lower than it needs to be, each of these conditions often starts with hyper- and hypo-, such as hyperthermia and hypothermic or hypertension and hypotension. If an entity is controlled through homeostasis, it doesn't imply that its value must be completely stable to maintain health. The body's core temperature, for example, is regulated by homeostasis mechanisms by temperature sensors, among which are hypothalamus in the brain. However, the set point of a regulator is regularly reset. For example, human core temperatures vary throughout the day (influenced by circdian rhythm), with the lowest temperatures occurring at night and highest in the afternoon. Normal temperatures also vary as a result of menstruation cycles. The temperature regulator's set point is reset when the infection is to produce a fever.

Gubalwood contains vessels that transport water from root to leaf and also to store water. The larger the number of leaves, the greater the volume of gubal wood. Gubalwood is thicker on the top of the bar, but volume is the same as the bottom. There's a close link between the wood's properties and the nature of the tree that produces it. Wood density varies according to its species and determines the strength of the wood. Mahogany wood and teak, for example, have a medium - to - high density, so it is good to be treated as furniture and construction wood. However, chestwood and low density, so it is only proper to create a beginning or other uses that do not require much strength. However, the definition of 'hardwood' and ' soft wood' in English (yakni hardwood and softwood, in a row) is more associated with the plant group that produces it. Hardwood is produced by large-leaf trees, whereas softwood is produced by needle-leaf trees. In fact, certain types of 'hardwoods', which have a low density, could be more soft than some kind of high-tuned softwood. Each type of wood has a variety of physical properties, which determines the quality and function of the wood. For example, software (softwood) is preferable to paper because it is easy to destroy and become pulp. Hardwood was used as a pillar. Also, the existence of certain features such as knots and colors also affect. Wood is the product of living plants with ungenerate fibers, so its physical nature will not be the same radial (from the empirical to the outside) and longitudinal (stangting wood, from the bottom up).",

So the measure of wood that is, usually for chemical purposes, wood that's dried with a furnace can be said to be \"absolutely dry.\" The effect of the existence of water in wood is to make wood softer and malleable. And so this water level affects other physical properties, such as the force of attraction and force of pressure. Besides water, wood has three primary components - cellulose, hemisellulose, lignin. The combination of all three is called lygnoselulose. Cellulose is a crystallized polymer compound of glucose, which fills about 41-43% of wood. Hemicelulose is an irregularly connected pentose, and it fills 20% of the wide-leaved plants, and 30% of them are coniferated. Lignin is composed of a hydrocarbon aromatic ring that has hydrophobic properties and fills about 23% of the plants with wide leaves and 27% of the conifer. In chemistry, the difference between hardwood and softwood is in the number and type of lignin contained in it. Besides lygnocellulose, wood consists of a variety of organic compounds called extractive compounds that vary in number and type depending on the tree species. Wood has extractive compounds of fatty acid, resin, wax, and decanter. These extractive compounds have such benefits as protecting logs from pests. Extractive compounds are one of the results of the non-wood forest. Roughly, there are different kinds of stems that are also called wood in non-botani definitions. The botanical bamboo is a monocotil of grassy tribes that have rods with power that can be compared to wood. Today bamboo is widely used as building materials, floors, boards, and so on where previously dominated by wood.",

Hardwood is preferred as fuel because it burns longer with less smoke. Burnt furnaces with chimneys (fireplace) are built largely in homes in temperate areas that aim to provide warmth in homes. In addition to being burned directly, wood can be used as biofuel by processing the biomass of lygnocellose with gasification, pyrolysis, and biochemistry produce a variety of fuels such as syngas, biomethanol, bioethenol, dimetil ether, and blindol depending on the type of processes used. Wood has long been used as art media to make wood carvings. The totem statues made by the Native North American people were made from conifer wood, usually Red Cedar (Thuja plicata). Various musical instruments, such as violins and guitars, are made of wood. The selected type of wood is adjusted to the desired tone. Sports equipment such as baseball bats and basketball - ring floors are made of wood. Ski boards, hockey sticks, bows are also usually made of wood but have now been greatly replaced by polymers and metals.

The Anglicans based their Christian faith on the Bible, the traditions of the Atholilic Church, the Apostonic succession (\"episcopic\"), and the writings of the Church Fathers.

By the end of the century, the resistance in Anglicanism to many traditional liturgy and to the episcopic was unacceptable to those who promoted the latest Protestant principles. In the first half of the 17th century, the Church of England and the Church of Ireland associated with it was presented by several Anglican ministers as a coverage of a different Christian tradition, with various theologys, structures, and practices representing one kind of middle or via different media between Protestantism and Roman Katolisism. This perspective became very influential in the next Anglican identity theories and was revealed in the description of Anglicanism as \"Catholic and Informationd\" (Catholic and Reformed). The difference between Protestant and Catholic trends in the Anglican tradition is a regular debate within certain Anglican churches as well as throughout Anglican Communion. Anglicanic efficacy is the General Book of Prayer, a collection of practices used in most of the Anglican churches over the centuries, and thus recognized as one of the ties that bind the Anglican Communion together. After the American Revolution, the Anglicans in the United States and North America (which later formed the basis for modern Canada) each were re-formed into autonomous churches with skekelola structures and their own bishops, the Episcopal Church of the United States and the Anglican Church of Canada.

Most water can be found in the sea (salt water) and in layers of ice (at the poles and peaks of the mountains). Also, water can be found in clouds, rain, rivers, fresh water surfaces, lakes, water vapors, and oceans of ice. The water in these objects moves along a cycle of water: evaporation, rain, and streams above the ground (runoff, including springs, rivers, estuaries) toward the sea. Clean water is essential to human life. Besides the Earth, large quantities of water are also estimated to exist in the northern and southern poles of the planet Mars, as well as in the months of Europa and Enceladus. Water can be solidified (ice), liquid (water) and gas (water vapor). Water is the only substance that is naturally found on the Earth's surface in all three forms.

Water is colorless, tasteless and odorless at standard conditions, which is at 100 kPa (1 bar) and temperature 273.15 K (0 \u00b0C). This chemical is an important solvent, which has the ability to dissolve many other chemicals, such as salt-salam, sugar, acid, some kinds of gas and many kinds of organic molecules. The state of liquid water is an unusual state in normal conditions, especially with regard to the relationship between other hirdrides similar in oxygen columns on the periodic table, which suggests that water should be in the form of gas, as hydrogen sulfide. By paying attention to the periodic table, it appears that the elements surrounding oxygen are nitrogen, flor, and phosphorus, sulfur and chlor. All of these elements when they bond with hydrogen will produce gas at normal temperature and pressure. The reason why hydrogen binds to oxygen forms a liquid phase, is because oxygen is more electronegative than those other elements (except for flor). The oxygen atoms in the electrons bond much stronger than the hydrogen atoms do, leaving a positive amount of charge in both hydrogen atoms, and the amount of negative charge in the oxygen atoms. The presence of each atom gives the water molecule a number of moments to be patterned. The force of electricity between the water molecules as a result of the pattern makes each molecule close together, making it difficult to separate and that ultimately raises the boiling point of water. These attractions are referred to as hydrogen bonds. Water is often referred to as a universal solvent because water dissolves many chemicals.",

In ion form, water can be described as a hydrogen ion (H+) associated with a hydroxide ion (OH-). Here is a physical fixed water at a certain temperature: a water molecule can be deciphered into elements of its origin by flowing electrical currents. This process is called water electrolysis. In cathode, two water molecules react by capturing two electrons, reduced to H2 gas and hydroxide ions (OH-). Meanwhile, on anode, two other water molecules break down into oxygen gas (O2), releasing 4 H+ ions and releasing electrons to the cathod. Ion H+ and OH- are neutralized so that some water molecules are re-formed. The overall equal reaction of the water electrolysis can be written as follows. The hydrogen and oxygen gases produced from this reaction form bubbles in electrodes and can be collected. This principle is then used to produce hydrogen and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) which can be used as a hydrogen vehicle fuel. Water is a strong solvent, dissolving many kinds of chemicals. And among them are some that mingle with water, and among them are some that do not mix with water. The insulation of a water substance is determined by the inequality of the force of the electrical attraction between the water molecules. If a substance can't match the force of attraction between water molecules, it doesn't dissolve and it settles in water. Water attaches itself to one's fellow man because water is polar. Water has a partial number of negative charges near the oxygen atoms due to a pair of electrons that are (almost) not used together, and a number of partial positive charges near hydrogen atoms.",

Water has a high adhesion attributed to its polar nature. Water has massive surface voltage caused by the strong properties of cohesion between water molecules. It can be observed when a small amount of water is placed in a surface that cannot be wetted or dissolved; it gathers as a drop. On the surface of a perfectly clean glass or surface of water can form a thin layer because of the molecular pull between a glass and a water molecule (adhesion style) is stronger than the cohesion of a water molecule. In biological and organelle cells, water comes in contact with membranes and the surface of proteins that are hydrophilic; that is, surfaces that have a strong interest in water. Irving Langmuir observed a strong force of rejection between surfaces of hydrophilic. To perform a dehydrated hydrophilic surface in the sense of releasing a strongly bound layer of water hydration requires careful work against these forces, called hydration forces. They're worth a lot of money, but they're fast in nanometer range or smaller. The importance of these forces in biology has been studied extensively by V.

Other medical literature recommends one liter of water per day, with additional exercise or in hot weather. Drinking water is healthy, but excessive exposure can cause hyponatremia - when sodium in the blood becomes too diluted.

In industrialized countries, most water is used as a solvent. Water can facilitate a biological process that dissolves waste. Microorganisms that are in the water can help break waste down to lower levels of pollution. Water is a singularity fluid, due to its capacity to form a 3D molecular network with a mutual hydrogen bond. This is because each molecule of water has 4 fractional charge in the tetrahedron direction, 2 positive charge of both hydrogen atoms and two negative charge of oxygen atoms. As a result, each molecule of water can form 4 hydrogen bonds with the molecules around it. For example, a hydrogen atom that lies between two atoms of oxygen, will form one covalent bond with one atom of oxygen and one hydrogen bond with another atom of oxygen, just as it happens in ice.

In the monograph, problems of Cell Permeability, Troschin thesis says that the solution partitions that occur between intracellular environments and extracellulars are not only determined by membrane permeability, but there is an accumulated solution in the protoplasm, forming a different gel solution with pure water. In 1962, Ling went through her monograph, A physical theory of the living state, stating that the water contained inside the cell experiences polarization into layers that cover the surface of the protein and is a bad solvent for the ion. Ion K+ is absorbed by normal cells, because the carboxyl clusters of proteins tend to attract K+ rather than Na+ ions. This theory, known as the induction hypothesis also speaks of the absence of the cassation pump, ATPase, which is bound to the cell membrane, and the distribution of all the solution is determined by a combination of interesting attractions between each protein with modification properties of the water solution in the cell. The results of the NMR measurement do indeed indicate a drop in water mobility in the cell but are quickly diffusioned with normal water molecules. This is then known as a two-fraction model, fast-exchange. The presence of the cadence pump driven by ATP on the cell membrane, continues to be a subject of debate, in line with the debate about the characteristics of fluid in the cytoplasm and normal water in general. The strongest argument against the theory of the special type of water inside the cell comes from among physicists.

Water is said to have its own balance which cannot be limited by cell membranes. Other experts believe that the water inside the cell is very different from the water in general. Water is not free to move because of the ionic surface effect, called bonded water (English: bound water), while the water outside the ion's influence is called free water (English: water bulb). Tied water can quickly dissolve an ion, because each type of ion will soon be attracted by each fractional charge of water molecules, so that kation and anion can be nearby without having to form salt. Ion is more likely to be hydrated by reactive water, dense with weak bonds, than inert water with strong binding powers. This creates water zones, for example, which are very hydrated, will tend to accumulate in more densed water phases, whereas the larger clusters will tend to accumulate in more intertwined water phases, and create ion partitions like the Hofmeister series as follows: Interaction notes between the water molecules and the ionic clusters assumed to occur at a short range, so hydrogens are reoriented in the direction of the anion and inhibit the interaction between water populations with free water. The orientation of water molecules bound together is increasingly limited to the surface of negative - charged polyelectric molecules including DNA, RNA, hialorunat acid, sulfate condroitin, and other charged biopolimer types.

The resilience of water molecules inside the structure of gel crystals is one example of the natural tendency of each component of a system to mix evenly. Water molecules can be released from gel in response to air pressure, rising temperatures or through evaporation mechanisms, but with the drop in the water content ratio, the ionic binding force that occurs between the solute molecules that hold water molecules is getting stronger. Nevertheless, this kind of ionic approach still does not explain some solution anomaly phenomena such as, the phenomenon of the solution's anomaly is thought to occur at long distances outside the ionic approach domain. The energy in the water molecules is higher when the hydrogen bonds that are possessed become less maximum, as when the water molecules are close to the surface or the hydrocarbon clusters. The hydrocarbon compound is then called hydrophobic because it does not form hydrogen bonds with water molecules. The hydrogen binding power of this condition will penetrate several water zones and ion partitions, so it is said that as a water character at long distances. At this range, the salt molecules like Na2SO4, sodium acetate and sodium phosphate will have a tendency to decompose into the caation of Na+ and the anion.

Generally available heat sources are drawn from water jacket main engines, which are used to cool primary engine components such as cylinder heads,liner etc. Temperatures generated from water jackets are about 70 degrees Celsius. But at this temperature water evaporation is not maximum, as we know that water evaporation occurs at 100 degrees centigrade under atmospheric pressure. So in order to produce clean water at 70 degrees we need to reduce atmospheric pressure, which is done by creating vacuums in the space where evaporation takes place. Also, as a result of the cooling vacuum of seawater evaporating at lower temperatures, water is cooled and collected and then transferred to the tank. At present most ships use reverse osmosis methods, one of the methods used in decks to produce fresh water. It is commonly used on passenger ships where there is a great need to produce fresh water. The reverse osmosis is a method of filtering that can filter out many large molecules and ions of a solution by giving pressure to the solution when it's on one side of the selection membrane. The process allows solutes to linger in a pressure - flowing layer so that the pure solvent can flow into the next layer.",

Osmosis is a natural phenomenon that occurs in living cells where solvent molecules will flow from low concentration areas to high concentration areas through a semipermeable membrane. This semipermeable membrane points to any cell membrane or membrane that has a similar structure or part of a cell membrane. The movement of the solvent continues until a balanced concentration is reached on both sides of the membrane. The reverse osmosis is a process of coercion a soluble of a high-soluted concentration area through a membrane to a low-soluted area by using a pressure beyond osmotic pressure. In an easier term, the reverse osmosis is pushing a solution through a filter that captures the solute from one side and allows the solvent income purely from the other side. To get fresh water from seawater can be done in a reverse osmosis way, a process of filtering seawater by using pressure directed through a filter membrane. This system is called ocean reverse osmosis and is widely used on ocean vessels or coastal clean water installations with raw seawater materials. This process has been used to process seawater for fresh water, since the early 1970s. In a different way learned urine, it is presented as a direct element, not directly or merely as a symbol.

Photos of water as an element in an object require special treatment, ranging from a filter of circular polarizer that helps remove reflections, to the utilization of old exposure techniques, a photography technique that relies on a slow opening to create a soft effect on the surface of the water.

This has proved to be true of the many theories of money presented by some experts. Money theory consists of two theories, which are static money theory and dynamic money theory. Static Money Theory or also called \"static qualitative theory\" aims to answer the question: is it really money? And why does that money have a price? Why is that money going around? This theory is called static because it doesn't question the changes in values caused by economic development. What's included is the theory of static money: money is like goods, it's value is not made up, it's equal to the value of the coin made into it. Example: gold money and silver. This theory states that money was created on the basis of the creation of society to make exchange easier. In addition, the theory also states that money itself can change when people approve of the changes that happen to the money. This theory states that currency is always equal to its current value. Both intrinsic and extrinsic values can affect that value. This theory was developed by George Friederich Knapp (1924) who claimed that the origin of money was country. When the state determines what it is to exchange and what it is to pay, then it is to make money. So money is worth due to the certainty of the state's legalized payment.

This park is a summary of Indonesian culture, which includes various aspects of everyday life in Indonesia's 26 provinces (in 1975) which were shown on traditional architecture bridges, and showed a variety of fashions, dances, and local traditions. In addition, in the middle of TMII there was a lake depicting a miniature of Indonesian islands in the center of it, a train, museums, and theaters of IMAX to my Airland Mas and Theater), these means to make TMII one of the most prominent tourist areas in Jakarta. The idea of building a miniature with all of Indonesia in it was triggered by the First Lady, Siti Hartinah, better known as Mother Tien Soeharto. This idea was triggered at a meeting on Cendana Street no. Jakarta 8 on March 13, 1970. The idea of making these Indonesian miniatures rose up after the First Lady listened and lived up to President Soeharto's speech on the balance of the general development of the GR House in 1971. In addition, he also often accompanied the President to visit friendly countries and see foreign tourist objects. So the idea of building a recreation park that describes the beauty and diversity of Indonesia. Through this recreation park, it is expected to inspire pride and love of the homeland of the entire Indonesian nation. So began a project called the Beautiful Indonesia Miniatur Project, which is carried out by our Hope Foundation. TMII began to be built in 1972 and was inaugurated on April 20, 1975. Various aspects of the natural and cultural wealth of Indonesia to the use of modern technology are demonstrated in an area of 150 hectares [150 ha].",

TMII has a logo that's basically made up of TMII, abbreviated by \"Maintain Indonesian Park.\" His mascot was a Hanoman puppet character named NITRA (Son Anjani). The Mascot \"The Beautiful Mini Indonesia Park\" was inaugurated its use by Mrs. Tien Soeharto, coincided with dwi windu age TMII, in 1991. In Indonesia almost every nation's tribe has different forms and features of buildings, not even a single nation has more than one traditional type of building. Traditional buildings or architecture that they make are always based on environmental and cultural conditions that they have. In TMII, that image is realized through the District Bridge, representing the tribes of the nation that are in the 34 provinces of Indonesia. The bridge of this province was built around the lake with miniature Indonesian islands, the themeally divided over six zones; Java, Sumatra, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Bali, Southeast Nusa, Maluku and Papua. Each bridge presents a typical local building. The bridge also features traditional clothes and clothing, wedding clothes, dance clothes, and ethnography artifacts such as distinctive weapons and everyday furniture, model buildings, and crafts. All of this was intended to provide complete information on the traditional way of life of various national tribes in Indonesia. Each province bridge is also equipped with platforms, amphitheaters or auditoriums to feature traditional dances, regional musicals, and customs ceremonies usually held on Sundays. Some bridges are also equipped with cafeterias or small stalls that serve typical Indonesian cuisines of the province, as well as with gift shops that sell handicrafts, T-shirts, and various souvenirs.",

In Abrahamic religions, angels are often described as kind heavenly creatures who act as intercessors between God and heaven and man. He is the Guardian of the heavens and the earth. In Abrahamic religions, angels were often grouped into hierarchys, although such clusters could vary among sects in any religion. Such angels were named or titled, such as Gabriel or \"the Angel of Destruction.\" The term \"angel\" has also been extended to various notions of spirits or figures found in other religious traditions. Theological study of angels is known as \"angelology.\" An angel expelled from heaven is referred to as a fallen angel. In the arts, angels are usually described as having a human form with extraordinary beauty and sometimes androgini; they are often identified by bird wings, halos, and bright light. In the religion of Islam, the angels were to be believed in, including the reconciliation of faith, the angels were created by God of the heavens and the earth, and they had a duty which God had given to Him. The angels were creatures created by God who neither ate nor drank nor did they possess the likes of men. Verily, the Muttaqun (pious - see V. 2:2) and Al-Muttaqun (the pious - see V. 2:2). The word \"angel\" appears in modern English from ancient English and ancient French. Both came from the Latin end of \"angelus\" (literally meaning \"mission\"), which was borrowed from the late Greek \"Oh no\" aggelos, usually transliterated by non-Gunani speakers in the form of phenetical \u00e1ngelos.",

Perhaps then, the earliest form of the word is Mycenaean \"a-to-ro,\" proven in the Linear B syllable. The translation \"\u00e1ngelos\" is the standard translation of the Hebrew word Biblical mal'\u0101kh, which simply indicates \"a messenger\" without its character. In association that follows in the Latin Vulgate, the meaning becomes double: when mall'\u0101kh or \u00e1ngelos should point to human envoys, words like nuntius or legatus apply. If the word refers to supernatural beings, the word angelus appears. Such differentiations have been taken over by local translations of the Bible, early Christian and Jewish interpreters and finally modern scholars. In Arabic etymology, the word 'Malabel' is a plural from Arab malak, which means strength, which is from the word mashdar mashmar-alkah, which means tracts, then the carrier of the mission is referred to as an army. Angels created by God were made of light (nur), based on one hadist of Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him), the Angel was created of light. Faith in angels is the belief that angels exist, even though we cannot see them, and that they are one of God's creatures. God created them from light.

Unlike Hebrew, this term is exclusively used for the heavenly spirit of the divine world, but not for human messengers. The Quran refers to angels' messengers and humans as \"apostles\" instead. The Koran is a major source of Islamic concepts about angels. Some of them, like Gabriel and Michael, are named in the Qur'an, others simply called by their functions. In the hadis literature, angels are often assigned to only one particular phenomenon. Angels played an important role in Isra Mikraj, where Muhammad met several angels during his journey in heaven. The next angel is often displayed in the eschatology of the Calamic Sciences, the Calamic Sciences, and the philosophy of Islam. The task given to angels includes, for example, communicating divine revelations, glorifying God, recording each person's actions, and taking a soul at death. In Islam, as in Judaism and Christianity, angels are often represented in anthropomorphism combined with supernatural images, such as wings, large in size or wearing heavenly objects.

Even if they're not focused on research, they've been shown in various folklore, philosophical debates and potassium science. While in the Islamic Age of Glory, the widespread notion was accepted as canonic, there was a contemporary tendency among scholars to reject many studies of angels, such as calling the Angel of Death by the name of Azra'il. Ibn Sina, who took advantage of the Neoplatonism Emanation of Al-Farabi, developed the angelological hierarchy Intellects, created by \"Monad (filsaphate). Therefore, the first creation by God was the highest angel followed by another great angel, identified with a low intelligence. Next, there's a lower angel or a moving ball, where in turn, emitting another intellect until it reaches the level of intellect, which rules over the souls. The tenth sense is responsible for realizing material and illuminating the mind. All the angels are present in the service of God. Some Islamic Modernism has stressed the reinterpretation of the metaphorical concept of angels. The angels are spirit creatures created by God, who are dedicated to His own purpose, both for the service of God and for the help of the believers.

They're referred to as \"the army of the heavens\" or \"Elohim\" or \"the army of the army,\" \"the Zebaot\" in the title of Yahhuwah Zebaot, Elohim of the heavenly armies, may be associated with the angels. This army is linked to the stars as well, because the stars are thought to be closely related to the angels. However, YHWH distinguished himself from the angels, and therefore the Hebrews were forbidden to worship the armies of heaven. Before the emergence of monotheism in Israel, the idea of angels was found in Mal'akh Yahuwah, the angel of YHWH, or Mal'ach Elohim. The Mal'akh Yahweh is a human form of Yahuwah. These are the limits (imposed by) Allah. Those who saw Malakh Yahuwah said they had seen you. Mal'ach Yahuwah (or Elohim) appeared to Abraham, Hagar, Moses, Gideon, &c., and led the Israelites in a cloud pillar. The phrase Mal'akh Yahweh may be a polite greeting to the Divine King; but rather a means of avoiding anthropomorphism, and then, when the angels are grouped, Mal'akh Yahweh means \"a high-ranking angel.\" Mal'akh Yahuwah's emulation with the Logos, or the second person of the Trinity, was not shown by reference to the Hebrew scriptures, but the idea of identification which exists with Elohim, but which in a certain sense differs from him, describes the tendency of the Jewish religious mind to distinguish individuals in the darkness of God.

The prophet Ezekiel, as a prophet in the Waste, may have been influenced by hierarchic hierarchies in the Babel religion, and perhaps by the angelology of Zoroastrianism, but it is not clear that this Zoroastrian doctrine had developed so early. Ezekiel 9 provides a detailed picture of cherubs (an angelic type). In one of his visions Ezekiel saw seven angels execute the judgment of Elohim upon Jerusalem. As in Genesis, they are described as \"humans\"; the mala'ach, because \"angels\", does not appear in the book of Ezekiel. Later, in Zechariah's vision, angels played an important role. They are called sometimes as \"man,\" sometimes as mal'ach, and Mal'akh Yahuwah seems to occupy the main place among them. In post-Bible times, heavenly armies became increasingly organized. Angels too vary, and they also have a name. In the beginning all angels were created in good condition, holy and faultless. But there are some fallen angels who have chosen to rebel against Elohim. This fallen angel is called a demon, and it is likely that Cherub was one of them. In his book Certitude Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h, founder of the Faith Bah\u00e1'\u00ed, described the angel as \"who has spent time with the fire of God, with all human qualities and limitations\" and had \"clothed himself\" with angelic attributes and had been \"blessed with spiritual attributes.\" 'Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1 described the angels as \"confirming God and His heavenly power\" and as \"the blessed being who has severed all ties with the underworld\" and \"leashed from the chains\" and \"the embrace of God abounds in grace.\" Bah\u00e1'\u00ed's writings also refer to Concourse on High, the host of angels, and Maid of Heaven's vision of Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h.",

For example, each individual has a guardian angel, called Fravashi. They protect humans and other creatures, as well as manifest God's energy. Amesha Spestas is often regarded as an angel, although there are no direct references, but more is Ahura Mazda's management (\"Wise God\"); which at first appears abstractly and then is personalized, associated with various aspects of divine creation. In the comment of Proclus (fourth century, under Christian rule) on Timoeus of Plato, Proclus used the terminology of the \"angel\" (agelikos and aggelos) in connection with metaphysical creatures. According to Aristotle, just as a major spiritual drive exists, so there must also be a spiritual secondary drive.

People affected by this virus will become vulnerable to opportunistic infections or are susceptible to tumors. Although existing treatment can slow the progression of the virus, the disease is not completely treatable. HIV and other viruses are commonly transmitted through direct contact between the inner layer of the skin (membrases) or the bloodstream, with HlV bodily fluids, such as blood, semen, vaginal fluid, preseminal fluid, and mother's milk. Infection can occur through intimate intercourse (vaginal, anal, or oral), blood transfusions, contaminated needles, between mother and baby during pregnancy, childbirth, or breast - feeding, as well as other forms of contact with the body's fluids. Scientists generally believe that AIDS comes from sub-Saharan Africa. AIDS has now become a plague. AIDS is thought to have infected 38.6 million people worldwide. In January 2006, UNAlDS cooperated with WHO to estimate that AIDS has caused more than 25 million deaths since its first recognition on June 5, 1981.

Most of these conditions are caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites, which are usually controlled by the elements of HlV's immune system. Opportunistic infections are commonly found in AIDS sufferers. HIV affects almost every organ of the body. AIDS sufferers are also at greater risk of suffering from cancers such as sarcoma Kaposi, cervical cancer, and cancer of the immune system called lymphoma. Usually AIDS sufferers have systemic infection symptoms; such as fever, perspiration (especially at night), swelling of glands, cold, feeling weak, and weight loss.

Pneumonia pneumocystis (PCP) is rarely found in healthy people who have good immunity, but it is generally found in people infected with HIV.

It can easily be handled if it has been identified, can appear in an early stage of HIV, and can be prevented by treatment therapy. However, tuberculosis resistance to various drugs is a potential problem in this disease. Despite the emergence of this disease in Western countries, it has been reduced because of the use of therapy with direct observation and other new methods, but that's not the case in the developing countries where HIV is most widely discovered. In the initial stage of HlV infection, tuberculosis appears as a lung disease. In the advanced stage of HIV infection, it often appears as a systemic disease that attacks other body parts (extrapulmonary tuberculosis). Symptoms are usually unspecific (constitutional) and not limited to one place. TBC along with HIV infections often attack bone marrow, bone, urinary tracts and digestive tracts, liver, lymph nodes, and the central nervous system.

This difference may occur because there is a difference between HlV subtypes in India. Patients with HlV infections basically have a higher risk of some cancer. This is because of the infection by the DNA virus that causes genetic mutations; that is especially the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), the Zacoma Kaposi (KSHV) virus, and the human papilloma virus (HPV). Sarcoma Kaposi is the most common tumor on HlV-infected patients. The appearance of this tumor in a number of homosexual youths in 1981 was one of the first omens of the AIDS outbreak.

The risk is also increasing in real, although smaller, by sexually transmitted diseases such as urine, chlamydia infections, and trichomoniasis that cause local lymphocytes and macrophage collections. HIV transmissions depend on the ease of transmission from uninfected sexual partners' vulnerabilities and vulnerabilities. The ease of transmission varies at various stages of this disease and is not constant between people. The unsensible load of plasma virus does not necessarily mean that the weight of a small virus in semen or the secretion of genitals.

Women are more vulnerable to HIV-1 infections because of hormone changes, ecology and vaginal microb physiology, and greater vulnerabilities to sexual diseases.

It can also happen to people who give and accept the mace and piercing of the body. Universal caution is often lacking in sub Saharan Africa and Asia because of inadequate resources and training. WHO estimates 2.5% of all HIV infections in sub Saharan Africa are transmitted through injections at unsafe health facilities. Therefore, the General Assembly of the United Nations, supported by the general medical opinion on this issue, encourages countries in the world to apply universal caution to prevent HlV infection through health facilities. The risk of HIV infection in blood transfusion recipients is very small in developed countries. In the developed world, donor selection is getting better and HlV observations are being made. However, according to WHO, the majority of the world's population have no access to safe blood and \"between 5% and 10% of the world's HlV infections occur through infected blood transfusions.\" The HlV transmission from mother to child can occur through the uterus during period of period, which is the last weeks of pregnancy and childbirth. If not treated, the level of infection from mother to child during pregnancy and childbirth is 25%. But if the mother had access to antiretroviral therapy and gave birth by caesar surgery, the infection rate was only 1%.

Yet, both systems are intended for epidemic monitoring and not for the clinical determination of the patient, because the definition used is neither sensitive nor specific. In developing countries, the World Health Organization system for HlV infections is used by using clinical data and laboratories; while in developed countries it is used by the Centers for Disease Control classification system (CDC) of the United States. In1990, World Health Organization (WHO) classified various infections and AIDS conditions by introducing phase systems to patients infected with HIV-1. This system was renewed in September of 2005. Most of these conditions are opportunistic infections that are easily treated to healthy people. There are two definitions of AIDS, both of which are issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Protection (CDC). At first, the CDC did not have an official name for the disease; so AIDS was referred to by the name of the disease associated with it, for example, the lymphadenopathy. HIV inventors even initially named AIDS the virus. The CDC began using the word AIDS in September 1982, and it defines the disease. In 1993, the CDC expanded their AlDS definition by including all of the people with T-cell numbers under 200 per \u25aaL blood or 14% of all of its lymphocytes as HlV positives. The majority of AIDS cases in developed countries use both definitions, both the last and pre-1993 definitions of the CDC.

In addition, only 0.5% of women contain in cities who visit public health facilities receive guidance on AIDS, undergo examinations, or receive their test results. This figure is even smaller in rural public health facilities. Thus, the blood of donors and blood products used for medical medicine and research, must always be examined for its HIV contamination. General HIV tests, including HIV enzyme immunoasis and Western blot testing, are performed to detect HlV antibodies in the serum, plasma, mouth fluid, dry blood, or patient urine. However, the period between infections and the growth of detectable antibody infections (window period) for everyone can vary. This is why it takes 3-6 months to figure out the seroconversion and positive results of the test. There are also commercial tests to detect other HlV antigens, HlV-RNAs, and HlV-DNAs, which can be used to detect HlV infections, even though antibody development has yet to be detected. Although these methods were not approved specifically for diagnosis of HIV infections, they had been used regularly in developed countries. Aggressive HIV has actually been known to happen in Africa before, but what happened in Cuba is massive. Usually from HlV to AIDS it takes five to 10 years without any treatment at all, but with HIV aggression it happens in just three years.

Although HlV can be found in saliva, the tears and urine of an infected person, but there are no records of infections because of those fluids, the risk of infection can be generally ignored. The majority of HlV infections come from unprotected sexual relations between individuals who are infected with HIV, as well as sexual inconsistencies. Heterosexual relationships were a major mode route of 80% of HIV infections in Africa in 1988, vulnerable to the category of prostitutes and individuals who engaged in promiscuous sexual relations. Gay relations in America, Ga\u00ebtan Dugas is either called or blamed as the first sufferer or Patient Zero with AIDS symptoms. AIDS is rumored to infect and kill 5 homosexuals with lung problems in 1981. Then in the 21st century, homosexuals were the main mode and the majority of infections, with infections two to three times the rate of heterosexual or 70%, as well as in Indonesia. During sexual intercourse, only male or female condoms can reduce the possibility of HIV infection and other sexual diseases as well as the possibility of pregnancy. The best evidence at present shows that the use of condoms that are common to reduce the risk of HlV infection to roughly 80% in the long run, even though these benefits are greater if condoms are used correctly at every opportunity.

A woman's condom has an inner ring that keeps a condom inside a vagina to put a woman's condom in, it has to be pressed. The obstacle is that women's condoms are rarely available and that they are unreachable for a large number of women. Early studies show that with female condoms available, sexual relations with protective protection as a whole have increased relative to unprotected sexual relations so that female condoms are an important HIV prevention strategy. The study of couples who are infected shows that with the consistent use of condoms, the rate of HlV infections on uninfected couples is under 1% per year. However, studies of behaviors and epidemiologists in Europe and North America show the existence of minority groups of young people who continue to engage in high-risk activities despite knowledge of HlV/AlDS, thus ignoring the risks they face over HIV infections. However, HlV transmissions between drug users have decreased, and HlV transmissions by blood transfusions have become quite rare in developed countries.

The United States government and health organizations encourage ABC's approach to lower the risk of HlV by means of sexual intercourse. As for the formula in Indonesian: You stay away from sex, act faithfully with couples, stop with condoms. Medical workers who follow universal caution, such as wearing latex gloves when injecting and always washing hands, can help prevent HIV infections. All AIDS prevention organizations advise drug users not to share needles and other materials needed to prepare and retrieve drugs (including syringes, cotton balls, spoons, drug thinners, straws, etc.). People need to use new and sterilized needles for each shot. Information on cleaning needles using bleach is provided by health facilities and needle exchange programs. In a number of developed countries, clean needles are found free in a number of cities, in exchange for a needle or a secure injection. Many countries have legalized the possession of needles and have allowed the purchase of injection equipment from apothecaries without the need for prescriptions.

Of all children thought to live now with HIV, 2 million children (almost 90%) live in Sub Saharan Africa. So far there is no vaccine or cure for HIV or AIDS. The only known method for prevention is based on the avoidance of contact with the virus or, if it fails, direct antiretrovirus treatment after significant contact with the virus, called post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). PEP has a four - week schedule that requires a lot of time. PEP also has unpleasant side effects such as diarrhea, ill health, nausea, and fatigue. The latest HlV infection handler is a highly active antiretrovirus therapy (Highly active antiretroviral therapy, HAART). This therapy has benefited people who have been infected with HlV since 1996, which is that after the discovery of HAART, it uses a protease inhibitor. THE current best option is a combination of at least three drugs (called \"knits) consisting of at least two kinds (or \"class\") of antiretrovirus material. The combination commonly used is nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptage inhibitor (or NRTI) with protease inhibitor, or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). Because HlV disease progresses more quickly in children than in adults, it also recommends more aggressive treatment for children than it does for adults. In developing countries that provide HAART treatment, a doctor will consider the quantity of the virus load, the rate of decreasing CD4, as well as the patient's mental readiness, when choosing to start the initial treatment.

Without HAART treatment, the turn of HIV infection into AIDS occurs at an average rate of between nine and ten years, and the next time it lasts after AlDS is just 9.2 months. HAART application is considered to increase patient survival time by 4 to 12 years. For some other patients, perhaps more than fifty percent, HAART treatment results far from optimal. This is because there are side-effects of the treatment that can't be tolerated, previous antiretroviral therapies that aren't effective, and certain HIV infections that are drug-resistant. Disordination and disorder in applying antiretroviral therapy are the main reasons why most individuals fail to benefit from HAART application. There are many reasons for this. The principal psychosocial system is the lack of access to health facilities, lack of social support, mental illness, and drug abuse. HAART treatment is also complex, due to a variety of combinations of pills, dose frequencies, food restrictions, and so on and so forth that must be run regularly. Side effects that also result in aversion to the regular application of HAART, including lipodistrophy, dislipidaemia, insulin resistance, increase in risk of cardiovascular systems, and congenital disorders in babies born.

Violence or fear of violence, has prevented many from doing HIV tests, examining how their tests have been tested, or trying to get treatment; so it may turn a chronic illness that can be controlled into a \"death sentence\" and resulting in the spread of HlV.

In heavily infected areas, epidemics have left behind many orphans cared for by their elderly grandparents. The higher levels of mortality in an area would cause the downside of the working population and those with the skills. These fewer workers will be dominated by young people, with less knowledge and experience and thus less productivity. Increased worker leave to see sick or sick family members on sick leave will also reduce productivity. Increased mortality will also undermine the mechanisms for human production and investment in human resources (human capital) in society, which is the result of the loss of income and the death of parents. Since AIDS causes the death of many young adults, it weakens the taxpayer population, reducing public funds such as education and other health facilities that are unrelated to AIDS. It puts pressure on the country's finances and slows economic growth. The effect of slowing down the growth of the number of taxpayers will increase when increased spending on the treatment of the sick, training (in place of sick workers), the substitute for sick costs, and the care of orphans for AIDS victims.

The primary biological function of lipids is to store energy, to play a role in resonance, and to act as a component of cell membrane building. Lipid is used in the cosmetics and food industry as well as in nanotechnology. Lipids can be widely defined as tiny molecules of hydrophobics or amphyphilics; amphiphiphilic properties of some lipids allow them to form structures like vesicles, lyposom multilamelar/unilamelar, or membranes in the acumatic environment. Biological lipids come, in whole or in part, from two types of biochemical subunits or different \"blocks,\" which is a group of ketoacials and isoprena. Using this approach, lipgolipids can be divided into eight categories: fatty acids, glyserolipids, glyceroflipids, sphingolipids, donarolipids, and polyketides (descended from the condensation of the subunit toomatic); and the creamy and the prenol lipid (from the condensation of the subunit isoprena). Although lipid terms are sometimes used as synonyms for fat, fat is a subgroup of lipids called triglycerides. Lipid also includes molecules such as fatty acids and derivatives (including tri-, di-, monoglycerides, and phospholids), as well as other metabolics that contain sterol such as cholesterol. Although humans and other mammals use biosynthesis paths to break down and synthesize lipids, some essential lipids cannot be made this way and must be obtained from food. Fat acids (or fatty acid residues when they're part of lipid) are groups for molecules synthesized by the chain of a primary acetyl-CoA with clusters of malonil-CoA or methylonol-CoA in a process called fat acid synthesis. They form from a hydrocarbon chain that ends with a nonpolar group of carboxic acids; this setting makes fat acid molecules have polar hydrophilic ends, and nonpolar hydrophobic edges and are not dissolved in water.",

If fatty acids contain cluster bonds, it is likely to have cis or trans geometry isomer, which has a significant effect on its molecular configuration. The cis-frame bond causes the acid chains to curve and emulate on the multiple bonds of the carbon chain. The three cluster bonds in the lynolenic acid (C-18), the most abundant asil fat chain in the thylakoid membrane, resulting in this membrane's very \u25aacair accompanism despite low environmental temperatures. It also makes lynolenic acids display sharp peaks on the chloroplast spectrum when viewed with an NMR C-13 high resolution. This in turn plays an important role in the structure and function of cell membranes. Most natural fatty acids have cis configurations, even though their trans form is present in some natural fat and oil or have been hydrated partially. A biological example of fatty acid is the eikosanoid group, which is mainly derived from aridonic acid and eikosapentaenoic acid, which includes prostaglandin, leukotriena, and tromboksana. Docosahexanoate acid is also important in the biological system, especially those related to vision. Another major class in the fat acid category is fat ester and fat amida. Ester fat includes substances between vital biochemistry such as wax esters, derivatives of tioester-fat acid koenzim A, derivatives of the ACP's tioester fatty acid, and fatty acid of carnitine.

Because it serves as an energy reserve, it is found in most of the fat reserves in animal tissues. Hydrolysis ester bonds on triglycerides as well as the release of glycerol and fatty acids from the adiposa tissue called \"fat mobilization.\" Another glyserolipid subclass is glycosylglycerol, which is marked by the presence of one sugar residue or more that is attached to glycerol via glycosydic bonds.

Gliserofosfolipid, usually referred to as phospholid, is largely in nature and is a key component of the dwilayed lipid in the cell, and is involved in the metabolism and intercellular communication signals. The neural tissue, including the brain, contains quite a lot of glycerofosfolipid. Changes in the composition of this substance can lead to various neurological disorders. Gliserofosfolipid can be divided into several different classes, based on the properties of the polar head group at the position of sn-3 glycerol skeletons in eukaryota and bacteria, or the position of sn-1 in the case of the archea. The example of glycerofosfolipid found in the biological membrane is phospharidilcolin (also known as PC, GPCho, or lesitin), phosphoidilelanmina (PE or GPEtn), and phosphatidilserin (PS or GPSer).

Procariota synthesizes polyprenol (called baktoprenol) whose terminal isoprenoid units, which adhere to oxygen, remain unsatisfied, while in the isoprenoid animal polyprenol (dollol) the terminal has been reduced. Sakarolipid or glukolipid are fatty acids that are directly bound to the sugar frame and form structures that correspond to the dwilay membrane. In dosarolipid, monoskarides replace glycerol skeletons on glyserolipid and glycerofosfolipid.

Polyketides are synthesized through polymerization of acetyl subunits and propionils by classical enzymes as well as iterative and multimodular enzymes that share mechanistic features with fatty syntase. They consist of large amounts of secondary metabolic and natural products of animals, plants, bacteria, fungi and sea sources, as well as great structural diversity. Many polyketides are cyclic molecules with skeletons that have been modified further by glycocillation, metilation, hydroxulation, oxidation, and/or other processes. Most antimicrobs, antiparaocytes, and anticancers used are polyketides or polyketide derivatives, such as erytromysin, tetracycline, avermektin, and antitumor epotilon.

Biological membranes are a form of lipid dwilayer lamelar phase. The formation of the dwilayer lipid is an exetherm when the glyserofosfolipid described above is in the acumatic environment. It's known as the hydrophobic effect. In an acumatic system, the head of the polar lipid aligns into a polar acumatic environment, while the hydrophobic tail minimizes their contact with water and tends to cluster together, forming vesicles; depending on the concentration of lipid, these biophysical interactions can result in myceles, lyposoms and bi-layed lipids. Other aggression is also observed and is part of the behavior of amphilid polymorphism. The behavior of phases is the field of study in biophysics and is the subject of current academic research. Misels and dwilayers form in the polar media with a process known as hydrophobic effects. When dissolving lipophilic or amphiphilic substances in the polar environment, polar molecules (that is, water in the acumatic solution) become more regular around the dissolved lipophilic substances, since polar molecules cannot form hydrogen bonds in the lipophilic area of an amphill. So in the academic environment, water molecules form an order of \"klatrate cages\" around the dissolved lipophilic molecules.

The sugar polyprenol phosphate and polyprenol sugar are functioned in the glycosillation reaction outside the cytoplasm, in the biosynthesis of extracaricide (e.g., polymerization of peptidoglis in bacteria), and in N-glicosillation of eukaryotic proteins. Cardiolipin is a glycerofosfolipid subclass containing four asil chains and three fairly abundant clusters of glycerol in the membrane in mitochondria. They believe they can activate enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation. Lipid is also the basis for the formation of steroids. The source of lipids in primary foods for humans and other animals is triglycerides, sterols, and animal phospholidis and nabati membranes. The metabolism of lipid synthesizes and degrades lipid reserves and produces characteristics of structural and functional lipid in individual networks. In animals, when there is excess intake of carbohydrates, excess carbohydrates are converted into triglycerides. This involves the fatty acid synthesis of acetyl-CoA and the esterification of fatty acid in the production of triglycerides, a process called lipogenesis. Fat acids are made by cytane fatty acids that polish and then reduce acetyl-CoA units. The acid chain on the fatty acid is expanded by a reaction cycle that adds the acetyl cluster, reduces it to alcohol, dehydrates it into an alkena cluster and then reduces it again into an alcana cluster. The biosynthesis of fatty acid is divided into two groups, in animals and fungi all these cytane fatty acid reactions are performed by single multifunction proteins, while on separate plant plastids and enzyme bacteria do every step of the way.

The saturated fat acid doubles linoleic acid and unsatisfied acids can't be synthesized in the mammal's tissue, and therefore it's essential fat acid then it has to be obtained from food. The triglyceride synthesis occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum through the metabolic pathways where the asil clusters in the fat asil-COA are moved to the hydrocsil cluster on glycerol-3-phosphate and diasylglycerol. The pen and isoprenoids, including carotenoids, were made by the assembly and modification of donated isoprena units from the reactive precursor isopentenil pirofosphate and the meethylalil turofosphate. These precursors can be made in different ways. In animals and archaea, mevalonate lines produce these compounds from acetyl-CoA, while plants and bacteria in non-mevalonate pathways use pyruvate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate as substrate. One important reaction that uses active isoprena donors is biosynthesis steroids. Here, the isoprena unit joins together making the scoalena and then folded into a set of rings to make lanosterol. Lanosterol can then be converted into other steroids such as cholesterol and ergosterol. Beta oxidation is a process of metabolism when fat acid is broken up inside of mitochondria and/or peroxysom to produce acetyl-CoA. For the most part, fat acid is oxidized by a mechanism similar to, but not identical to, the opposite of the process of fatty acid synthesis. That means, the two carbon fragments are released in a sequence from the tip of the acid carboxyl after the dehidrogenation, hydration, and oxidation to form beta-keto acid, which is broken through tiolysis.

Most of the fat found in food is in the form of triglycerides, cholesterol, and phospholids. Some diet fats are needed to ease the absorption of fats (A, D, E, and K) and carotenoids. Humans and mammals have dietal requirements for certain essential fatty acids, such as linoleic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid) and alpha-linolenatic acid ( omega-3 fat acid) because they cannot be synthesized by simple precursor in food. These two fatty acids are unsaturated carbon-18 fatty acids with differences in the number and position of the bond. Most vegetable oils are rich in linoleic acid. Alpha-linolenat acid is found in green plants, and in certain seeds, beans, and peas (especially hemp, rapa, walnuts, and soybeans). Fish oil is very rich in omega-3 long chains of eikosapentaomaic acid and docosahexanoic acid (DHA).

The term \"ignostisism\" was introduced by Sherwin Wine, a rabbi and an important figure in Jewish Humanism. Ignosticism is a view that states that any religious term or theological concept must be accompanied by a coherent definition. Without a clear definition, the term cannot be discussed in any meaningful way. The term or concept must also be pronounced. Since these conditions were not met, the ignostic takes up the position of noncognitist theological, which states that the existence or nature of the terms given (and the debate about them) is meaningless. For example, if the term \"God\" does not point to anything that can be defined with reason, then there is no method to determine the absence of God.

The scientific study of language is called linguistic science. Estimates of languages in the world vary from 6,000 to 7,000 languages. The exact estimate, however, depends on an random change that may occur between language and dialect. The natural language is spoken or sign language, but each language can be encoded into the second media using audio, visual, or tactile stimulus, for example, graphic writing, braille, or whistling. This is because human language is independent of modality. As a general concept, \"language\" can refer to cognitive ability to learn and use complex communication systems, or to explain a set of rules that make up the system or a set of pronunciations that can be produced from those rules. All languages depend on the process of semiosis to connect gestures with certain meanings. The spoken language and sign language have a phonological system that governs how symbols are used to form a sequence known as words or morfem, and a syntax system that regulates how words and morfems are combined to form phrases and mentions. Human language is unique because it has productivity, recursive and shifting properties, and because overall human language depends on conventions and social education. Its complex structure is capable of providing possible expressions and uses that are broader than known animal communication systems. Since hominin times, language has been estimated to begin gradually to change the inter-prime communication system. Primates then began to acquire the ability to form a theory of mind and intensity. These developments are sometimes estimated along with increased brain volume, and many linguisticists argue that language structures develop to serve certain social and communicative functions.",

Hence, in addition to being used for communication, language also has many social and cultural functions, such as identifying a group, social stratification, and social grooming and entertainment. Languages change and vary all the time, and the history of evolution can be reconstructed by comparing modern languages to determine which qualities it has to have in its ancestral language so that change can occur.

Theory of functionality tends to study grammar as a dynamic phenomenon, as a structure that is always in the process of changing when used by its speakers. This view causes linguistic studies to be important. Tipology studies are classifications of languages according to their structural features. This interest arose because it could show that the grammatical processes tend to follow a course that depends partly on tipology. In the philosophy of view language are often associated with the last works of Wittgenstein and with philosophers of common languages such as G. E. Moore, Paul Grice, John Searle and J. L. Austin. Human language is unique in comparison with other forms of communication, as is used by animals other than humans. The communication systems used by other animals such as bees or apes are closed systems consisting of a number of possible limited expressions. On the other hand, human language is not covered, and it is productive. And Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise. This means that the system can only be studied through social interactions. The known communication system used in animals, on the other hand, can only convey a number of phrases that are generally passed on genetically. Some species of animals have been proven to be able to acquire forms of communication through social learning, such as Bonobo Kanzi, who have learned to express themselves using a collection of symbolic lexigrams. Likewise, many species of birds and whales study their voices by imitating other members of their species. However some animals can acquire a number of words and symbols, no one can learn more of the different signs known by an average human being four years old.",

One of the differences between human and animal language is the use of grammatical categories and semantics, such as verbs, verbs, present and the past, to convey the most complex meanings of human beings. For example, speech uses hearing modulation, while sign language and writing use visual modulation, and braille's writing uses touch modulation. And even though some of the animal's communication systems can be like that of a bee that can communicate the location of an out-of-vising source of nectar, it is considered unique. The theories about the origin of languages are different in terms of the basic assumption of what language is. Some theories are based on the idea that language is so complex that one can't imagine it emerges from non-existence in its final form, but it must have developed from the pre-linguistic system of pre-human ancestors. This theory can be referred to as a theory based on sustainability. The opposite view of language is that language is a unique human trait that can not be compared to anything other than human beings, and that it should suddenly appear in the transition from pre-hoid to human beings. This theory can be defined by means of sustainability.",

Those who view language as an innate birth language, for example, psychologist Steven Pinker, hold the precedent as an animal cognitive, while those who see language as a social learning tool, such as psychologist Michael Tomasello, see it develop from animal communication, either primate cues or vocal communication to help in working together. The other model sees language developing from music, a view supported by Roussseau, Herder, Humboldt and Charles Darwin. Because the rise of language was predated by human prehistoricity, related developments left no trace of history, and there is no comparison process that can be observed at this point. The theory that emphasizes sustainability often looks at animals to see if, for example, primates display traits that can be seen as analogies to the language forms of pre-humans. Other alternatives, early human fossils can be inspected to see the physical adaptation of the use of language or the pre-linguistic footprint of symbolic behavior.

Studies on language, linguistics, have evolved into science since the first description of grammar from a particular language in India over 2000 years ago. Now, linguistics is a science that pays attention to all aspects of language, studying them from all the points of view that have been described above. Academic study of language is done from many discipline areas and from a different theoretical perspective, all of which provides a modern approach to linguistics. For example, linguistics descriptively dissecting the grammar of a language, linguistically developing the best theory to prescribe language as a study based on the data of any other type of human language still in existence, sociolinguistics learning how to use social language for social purposes and grammatical descriptions, neurolingistics learning how the language is processed in a human brain, and doing experiments on language, linguisticly computing is built from linguistics and spectical models to build complex models that sometimes wish to process natural language or to process the language, whether it's written language and it's based on language, and it's based on language.

The scientific exam expanded from the Indo-Epa language to the common language of Wilhelm von Humboldt. In the early 20th century, archeology introduced the idea that it was a static system of interconnected units, defined between the units. By introducing the difference in language analysis, between diaronic and synchronitic analysis, Saussure laid the foundation of modern linguistic discipline. Saussure also introduced several dimensions of language analysis that were still at the base in contemporary linguistic theories, such as the difference between sintagma and paradigm and the difference between Langue-parole: distinguishing language as an abstract system (langue), from language as a concrete manifestation of the system itself (parole). In the 1960s, Noam Chomsky formulated the generative theory of language. According to this theory, the most basic form of language is a universal syntax set of rules for all humans, underlying all human grammars. Chomsky called it the ultimate purpose of linguistic discipline. Thus, the grammar of every language is important for linguistics because by that science humans will be able to understand the universal rules underlying the origins of linguistic diversity that appear to be inherited. As opposed to the formal theory of the generative flow, the functional theory of grammar proposes that since language is essentially a tool, the structure is better analyzed and understood by referring to their functions.

Talk is the basic modulation of language in all cultures. The mastery and production of oral language depends on the existence of the advanced capacity to control lips, tongues and components of other vocal equipment, the ability to artificially translate oral sounds, and the neurological equipment needed to acquire and produce language. The genetic basis for human language is just started, and the only genes that have affected language production positively are FOXP2. When affected by mutations, the person may develop an inborn language disorder. The brain is the coordination center of all linguistic activity; it regulates the production of linguistic cognitive and illumination and mechanics of oral production.

The spoken language depends on the physical ability of humans to produce sound, a longituthenal wave is dispersed by air at a frequency that can vibrate eardrums. This ability depends on the physitology of human oral organs. These organs are made up of lungs, sound boxes, and top vocal systems - throats, mouths and noses. By controlling different parts of oral equipment, air flow can be manipulated to produce different oral sounds. The oral voice can be analyzed into a combination of segmentation and suprasment. The segmentation is that it follows one another in a row, which is usually represented by different letters in alphabet scripts, as in the Roman script. In free speech, there are no clear boundaries of one segment to another, nor is there generally a sound gap between words. Consonant consonants and vocals are combined to form syllabels, which are then combined to form formant structures; this can be fonetically distinguished through space between two respirations. In an acoustic way, these different segments are characterized by different formant structures, which can be seen in a spectogram of sound wave recordings (see the Spectogram of the formant structure of three English vowels).

Consonants are sounds that have friction sounds or closures at certain points in the upper vocal system. Consonant sounds vary from place of artificiality, such as places in vocal systems where air flow is stunted, mainly on the lips, teeth, alveolar ridge, palate, uvula, ulottis. Each place of interpretation produces a different set of sound, which is further distinguished by the arulation, or kind of friction, either full, in a case where consonants are called octuple or stops, or levels of fricatative equipment and approman.Ksonan can also be blown, depending on whether the vocal cords in the vibration set of the air are the flow as long as the sound (bilent) of the bus (bilant) is different from the buzz. Some verbal sounds, both vocal and consonant, involve spending the airflow through the nasal hole, and this is called nasal or nasalization sound. Other voices are defined by the way the tongue moves in the mouth: like the I's voice (called lateral, because air flows on both sides of the tongue), and the r sound (called r) characterised by how the tongue is positioned relative to the flow of air.",

The study of the semiotic process, how sign and meaning are combined, is used, and interpreted is called semiotic. The requirements can be formed from sound, motion, letters or symbols, depending on whether the language is pronounced, or written, and they can be combined with complex cues like words and phrases. When used, a signal is used and moved by a sender by a channel to the translator who translates it. Some properties that limit human language to other communication systems are the utilities of linguistic cues, meaning that there is no predictable connection between a linguistic gesture and its meaning, the duality of the linguistic system, meaning that linguistic structures are built by combining large structures that can be seen as large layers, for example how sound forms words and words form phrases, the properties of language elements, meaning that the building elements of linguistics are unit-unitics, for example sounds, and words, that can be distinguished with different patterns, and reorganized in different patterns, and the functionality of the system, meanings that include the limited number of language elements, the number of lings can combine into infinite combinations. The rules about which gestures can be combined to form words and phrases are called syntax or grammar.Maknas are connected to certain gestures, morfem, words, phrases, and text are called semantics.

In a language, the arrangement of gestures that are connected to certain meanings is called lexicon, and a gesture that is connected to a meaning is called lexeme. Not all meanings in a language are represented by one word. Sometimes semantic concepts are contained in morphology or syntax of a language in grammatical categories. All languages have semantic structure of predicate: a structure underlying a property, state, or action. Traditionally, semantics have been understood as a study of how speakers and listeners give correct value to a statement, so the meaning can be understood as a process in which a predicate can be said true or wrong about an entity, for example: \"x is y\" or \"x then y]. \"Recently, this model of semantics has been equipped with a more dynamic model of meaning that combines the same knowledge of context where a sign is interpreted into the production of meaning. Depending on the modalities, language structures can be based on sound systems (speak), gestures (signs), or graphs or tactile symbols (writes). The ways in which language uses sound or gestures to form meanings are studied in phonology. The study of how humans produce and declare vocal sounds are called by phonel.

In writing, temporary dimensions when sound and words flow in spoken languages are represented spatially in the form of directors.

Some categories include grammatical encoding of participants and preditative predicates in different languages between relation to predicates, encoding of relaxation and spatials in the predicates, and systems of the grammatics govern between speakers and recipients and who they are talking about. Languages classify parts of the talk into classes depending on function and position relative to other parts.

Other common categories are syllables: words that describe properties or the quality of nouns, such as \"red\" or \"great.\" Words classes also have different functions in grammar. Prototypely, verbs are used to form predicates, while nouns are used as predicate arguments. In a sentence like \"Sally run,\" the predicate is \"run,\" because it's a word that indicates certain circumstances of his argument \"Sally.\" Some verbs like \"swear\" could require two arguments, for example: \"Sally Cuss John.\" The predicate that uses only one argument is called intransitive, and the predicate that uses two arguments is called transitive.

This changes the Latin meamina into France] and the United States maam. Changes also occur in the grammar of the language on discursus patterns such as idioms or certain constructions to grammaticalization. This often occurs when the word or morfem aus and the gregorical system are consciously reconfigured to replace the missing elements. For example, in a variety of spanish Carribean suffixes /s/ has disappeared. Since Spanish Standards use the suffix /s/s in morfem, both subjects \"you\" on the work word, variations now have to express the second word t\u00fa. This means that \"your name\" is \u00bfcoms? 'como te 'jamas') at Spanish Standards, but 'commo 'tu te 'jama) in Spain Carribean. A simple change of sound has affected morphology and syntax. The other main reason for changing the grammar is gradually from idioms to new forms of grammar, for example the way in English construction \"going\" is missing aspects of its use and in a variation of English is almost the default sentence (that is I'm gonna). The change in language can be caused by the \"internal language\" factors, such as the change in speech is motivated by certain sounds is very difficult to distinguish by audio or to express, or because certain patterns of changes that cause certain rare types of construction types to shift to more common types. For others from language changes are social, such as the time of certain interpretations become symbols of members of certain groups, such as social classes, or ideologies, and because of their being adopted by those who want to be identified with that group or idea.

Although the Christian Church of mainstreams prevailed over Montanism for generations, and it branded it a heretic teaching, it survived in some isolated places until the 8th century. Some people create parallels between moncanism and Pentecostalism (called some Neo-Montanism). The most well - known Montanis was Tertullian, who was the most prominent Latin church writer before his conversion to Montanism. A moncanist called Montanis Montanus visited rural settlements in Asia Minor after his repentance, and taught and testified to what he said was the Word of God. However, his teachings were considered misguided by the orthodox Church for a number of reasons. He claims that not only had received a series of revelations directly from the Holy Spirit but also personally was the incarnation of the comforter spirit mentioned in the Gospel of John 14:16. Montanus accompanied by two women, Prisca, sometimes called Priscilla, and Maximmila, who also claimed to be the incarnation of the Holy Spirit that moved and inspired them.

Bishop Apolinarius found the church in Ancyra split in two, and he opposed \"fake made\" (quoted by Eusebius 5.16.5). But there were serious doubts in Rome, and Pope Eleuvus even wrote letters to support Montanism, although he later withdrew (Tertulianus, \"Adversus Praxean\" c.1, Trevett 58-59).

When he was ostracized, he cried out, \"I am driven out like a wolf from among the sheep.\" I am not a wolf: I am the word and the spirit and the power.

By producing oxygen gas as a byproduct of photosynthesis, the phenobacterial is thought to have transformed the thin atmosphere at the beginning of earth's formation into an oxidized atmosphere, resulting in a massive range of Earth's earth-wide exposures and a dramatic oxygenation event has altered life-form composition on Earth by stimulating biodiversity and making an anaerobic organism approaching its extinction. According to endosymbiotic theory, chloroplasts found in plants and alga eukaryotics are the evolution of the ancestors of cyanobacteria through endosymbiosis. Saanobakteria can be said to be the most successful microorganism on Earth. These bacteria genetically have many variations; they can also live in different habitats throughout the earth, scattered in fresh water, seawater and land ecosystems, and they're found in the Tretstrem basins, such as hot springs, salt factories and freshwater bays. Saanobakteria can be found nearly all the territorial and acumatic habitats of the Sea, fresh water, damp soil, the rock that is temporarily exposed to water in deserts, rock cadas and soil in the mountains, and even on rocks in Antarctica. They can appear as planktonic cells or form phototropic biomovies. They were found in almost all endolithic ecosystems. Some of them are endosimbiosis organisms in likens, plants, various protistas, or ocean sponges and provide their host with energy.",

Infrared is not part of visible light by the human eye but has a wavelength greater than that of red. Fitochrome is found in all plants. Similar molecules are also found in bacteria. Plants use fitocromics to regulate several aspects of adaptation of the environment, such as photoperiodism, dictation, transplantation and germination (especially dicotilted), leaf morphology, log - pading, and chlorophyil synthesis. Chemically structured, the fitochrome sensor part is a chromophor of the bilin (so called a fitomobile), which is still a family of chlorophyil or hemophrine (all of which have a heme skeleton). This chromosome is protected or bound by apoprotein, which also affects the performance of the sensor part. These chromosomes and apoproteins together are referred to as the phyrochrome. Research on the effects of red and red light far away on the growth of plants between 1940-1960 was conducted by Sterling Hendricks and Harry Borthwick of the Beltsville Farm Research Center in Maryland, using spectrographs from the remnants of World War II. From its result it is known that red light spurres away and triggers a response to the flowers. In addition, red light has a far - reaching effect on the effects of red light. Advanced research shows that the light - sensitive part of the light stimulates is in the leaves. It was not until 1959 that Warren Butler, biophysicist, and Harold Siegemman, a biochemist, managed to identify the pigment responsible for this symptom using spectrophotometry techniques. Butler called the pigment a phyrochrome. It took 23 years before Peter Quail and Clark Lagarias reported the biochrome chemistry purifying of plants (1983).",

Bishkek was at an altitude of 800 meters, just north of the Ala-Too Mountains, an expansion of the Tien Shan mountain, which was as high as 4,800 feet [4,800 m] and thus created a beautiful view of the city. To the north of Bishkek was a vast meadow with no luxuriant trees (steppe) and extended to neighboring Kazakhstan. Chui River runs in most of Bishkek. In ancient times, Bishkek, one of the silk routes, was made a resting place for caravans (caravans) that passed through the mountains of Tien Shan. In 1825, this area was fortified by Uzbek's defense against the Kokhand government with a mud fortress. In 1862, the fortress was taken down and destroyed when the Russian Tzar expanded the area. Then the site became a Russian garrison and was developed and named Pishpek since 1877 by the Russian government to encourage the poor Russians who were given a black land field to settle there. In 1926 the city of Pishpek became the capital city of ASSR Kirgiz newly formed and named Frunze after Mikhail Frunze, a close associate of Lenin who was born in Bishkek and played an important role during the 1905 and 1917 revolutions as well as during the Russian civil war in the early 1920s.",

The taxon includes an RNA virus that encodes the RNA polymerase enzyme that depends on RNA (RDRP); and including the reverse transcription virus (both with the genome of RNA or DNA) that encodes the polymerase enzyme of DNA that depends on RNA (RDDP). The RDRp enzyme is also called the RNA replicase, which produces RNA from RNA. Meanwhile, the RDDp enzyme, also called the reverse transcripttage enzyme, produces DNA from RNA. These enzymes are important to replicate the genome of the virus and copy the virus gene into the ambassador's RNA (mRNA) for the translation of viral proteins. Riboviria was set in 2018 to accommodate all the RNA encoders of RDRp and expanded a year later to also include the RDDp retrovirus encoder. These two viral groups were placed in two separate kingdoms: the Orthornavirae empire for the RNA encoder RdRp virus, which includes all RNA viruses, and the Parrnaviare empire for the RDDp encoder virus, which is all the back-to-back transcription virus. These two groups are most likely descendants of the nonvirus element that encodes the reverse transcripttase enzyme, although the origin of the Orthornavirae empire is precisely unclear. Although the Riboviria world has only a few viruses that infect procariota, this taxon covers most of the eukaryota infection viruses, including most of the human, animal, and plant viruses. Many of the viral diseases are famous for the Riboviria, such as corona virus, Ebola virus, HIV, influenza virus, and rabies virus.

Slovenian Ethnics form the absolute majority of the country's population. Slovenian, one of the members of the Southern Slav language, is official. Slovenia has a climate dominated by the continent, with exceptions to coastal regions and Julian's Alps. The sub-mediate climate reaches an extension north of the Diari Alps that rotates the country in the northwest-northeast direction. Julian's northwest Alps have an Alps climate. The continent's climate is getting clearer towards the Pannonian Basin in the Northeast. The largest city and central government, Ljubljana, lies in the middle of the country. Slovenia historically became the crossroads of Slavic, German, and Roman cultures. The region that was now Slovenian was once part of many different countries: the Roman Empire, the Byzantine Empire, the Karoling Empire, the Holy Roman Empire, the Hungarian Empire, the Venice Republic, the provinces of Iliria in Napoleon's First Empire, the Austrian Empire and the Austria-Hongaria Empire. In October 1918, Slovenians helped to establish Slovenian, Croatian, and Serbian countries. In December 1918, they joined the Serbian Empire into the Yugoslavian Kingdom.

Following Liudewit's anti-Franka rebellion in the early 9th century, the Franka people removed the Karantania princes, replacing them with their own border dukes.

The significant mountains, the great rivers and their proximity to Danibia played a role in the development of the transportation corridors of the area. One special advantage recently was the Pan-Eropa V Corridor (the fastest connection between the North Adriatic, and Central and Eastern Europe) and X (connecting Central Europe with the Balkans). This gave him a special position in the integration and restructuring of social, economic and European cultures. The transport of travel and passengers was a large part of Slovenian transportation of 80%. Personal cars are much more popular than public road passenger transports, which experience significant decline. Slovenia has a very high density of highways and highways compared with the average European Union. The highway system, which accelerated its development after 1994, slowly but surely turned Slovenia into a big conundrum. Other roads have worsened rapidly because of the lack of maintenance and the overall increase in traffic. The existing Slovenian railways are out - of - date and have difficulty competing with the freeway network; some of them as a result of scattered settlements. Because of this fact and the projection of increased traffic through the harbor of the Suit, which was mainly by train, the second rail on the case route was in the early stages of the work. With a lack of financial assets, maintenance and modernization, Slovenian railway networks have been neglected. Because of out - of - date infrastructure, railway transport shares have dropped in Slovenia. The transport of train passengers has recovered after a drastic decline in the 1990s. Pan-Europe V and X railway corridors, and several major European rail lines meet each other in Slovenia. All international transit trains in Slovenia serve access to Ljubljana.",

Bioethics can be described as science to sustain life and focus on the use of biological sciences to improve the quality of life. In a broader sense, bioethics is the application of ethics in biological sciences, medicines, health care and related fields. As a rational ethic, bioethics are the turning point of analysis of scientific, biological, and medical data. The rightfulness of human intervention is warranted. Human transcendental value is highlighted in relation to the creator as an absolute value holder. Sometimes, the term bioethics is also used to replace medical ethics terms, which include ethical problems about biological sciences such as animal investigations, as well as efforts to manipulate nonhuman genetic forms. Often, the use of bioethics and medical ethics is exchanged. In this study, biology, biotechnology, ecology, agriculture, medicine, politics, laws, and philosophy are used as a standard debate material. Included in these questions are the definitions of death, euthanasia and the right to death, borrowing the wombs, the use of alien organisms in crops or other economics, the utilization of seeds and medicinal plants from the original communities by multinational organizations, biological hijackings, and the use of biological weapons. The term bioethics was first introduced in 1927 by Fritz Jahr, who \"was expected to contribute a lot of arguments and discussions in contemporary biology research involving animals\" in an article on \"biological inevitability.\" At the time he was hinting at the use of scientific issues of animals and plants. In 1970, American biochemist Van Rensselaer Potter also used that term in a broader sense, which included solidarity with biosphere, thus producing global ethics, a discipline that represents the relationship between biology, medicine, ecology, and humanitarian values in order to achieve the survival of both humans and other species of animals.",

Bioethics is a branch of biological science and medical science that deals with the problems of life, not only considering the problems that are happening in the present, but also taking into account the possibilities of the future. Although it may still be a new term for most people, bioethics has now become a new kind of worldwide movement. Its presence and urgency cannot be released from the development of years science, especially biology and medical science that raise extraordinary ethical problems. Bioethics is a new discipline of science, which is a combination of biological knowledge (biological) with the knowledge of human value systems. This definition also provides the purpose of bioethics, which is to build a bridge between science and humanities, to help the human beings to stay safe and sustainable, and to perfect the civilized world. Bioethics is an interdisciplinary study of the problems posed by the development in biology and medical science both micro and macro scales, present and future. Bioethics include social, religious, economic, and even political issues. Bioethics besides talking about medical fields, such as abortus, euthanasia, organ transplants, butan reproductive technology, and genetic engineering, discuss health problems, cultural factors that play a role in the scope of public health, patient rights, traditional healing morality, work environments, demographics, and so on.

Bioethicists often disagree between themselves on the exact limits of their discipline, arguing whether it should pay attention to the ethical evaluation of all questions involving biology and medicine, or just some of these questions. Some bioethicists will narrow ethical evaluations solely on health - care morality or technological innovation, and the time of human health care. Others will expand the coverage of ethical evaluations to include the morality of all actions that might help or endanger organisms capable of feeling fear. The scope of bioethics can develop with biotechnology, including cloning, gene therapy, life extensions, genetic engineering, astrophetics and life in space, and the manipulation of basic biology through changes in DNA, XNA, and proteins. This development will affect the evolution of the future, and it may require new principles that discuss life at its core, like biotic ethics that value life itself in its own process and basic biological structure, and seek its spread. Panbiotics are trying to secure and expand life in the galaxy. Yuval historian Noah Harari saw an existenceal threat in an arms race in artificial intelligence and biological engineering and he stated the need for close cooperation between nations to overcome threats by technological interference. Harari says AI and biotechnology can destroy what it means to be human. One of the first areas handled by modern bioethics is human experiments. The National Commission for the Protection of the Subject for Biomedical Research and Human Behavior was originally founded in 1974 to identify basic ethical principles that should underpin the implementation of biomedical research and behavior involving human subjects.",

Others have added non-maleficience, human dignity, and the sanctity of life to this list of major values. Altogether, Belmont's report has led studies in a direction that focuses on protecting vulnerable subjects and encouraging transparency between researchers and subjects. Research has been booming in the last 40 years and because of technological advances, it is estimated that human subjects have transcended Belmont's report, and there needs to be a desired revision. Another important principle of bioethics is the placement of values in discussion and presentation. Many discussion - based bioethic groups exist in universities across the United States to fight for such goals. Take, for example, the Ohio State Bioethics Society and the Bioethics Society of Cornell. Professional versions of these organizations also exist. Many bioethicists, especially medical scholars, give the highest priority to autonomy. They believe that every patient should determine which course of action they consider most appropriate to their beliefs. In other words, patients must always have the freedom to choose their own treatment. Many scholars have formulated bioethic theory, such as Beauchamp and Childress: Franse Abel formulate the definition of bioethics translated as follows: Bioethics is an interdistinguishment study of problems posed by biology and medical science both on a microscale and on a macro scale, more than about its impact on large societies and their present and future value systems. The field of bioethic coverage has reached various studies in humans, starting with debates about the limits of the life of Tirzah, such as abortion, euthanasia, surgery with limited health services allocation (e.g. organ donations) can actually reject health services for religious or cultural reasons.",

Others will expand the scope of ethical evaluations to include the morality of all actions that may help or endanger organisms capable of fear. In the field of utilization of biological resources, it develops the technology of genetically modified organisms, genetically modified organisms that in their use require research and careful regulation because of the issues of biological security and food security attached to it. Thus, the Indonesian bioethics committee was formed. The ethics affects medical decisions made by health - care providers and patients. Medical ethics is the study of moral values and judgments that apply to medicine. Four major moral commitments are to honor autonomy, kindness, nonmalificence, and justice. These experts are like the biothetic theories of Beauchamp and Childress mentioned above. Using these four principles and thinking about what doctors especially care about their practice scope can help doctors make moral decisions. As a scientific discipline, medical ethics includes practical applications in clinical arrangements and work in history, philosophy, theology, and sociology. Medical ethics tend to be understood narrowly as an applied profession ethic; whereas bioethics have a broader application, touching the philosophy of science and biotechnology issues.

In treating sufferers, doctors must be free to use a new way of diagnosis or therapy, if this is considered a means of saving lives, restoring health or reducing suffering. Benefits, dangers and feelings that do not occur because of the new drugs or methods used, must be weighed against the excess of the diagnostic methods and therapies that were present at the time. In every medical study, every patient must get a good method of diagnosis and therapy. The patient's refusal in a study should not affect the relationship of doctors and patients.

Many scholars consider bioethics to appear in response to the lack of accountability in health care in the 1970s. :2 Learning clinical practices of ethics in health care, Hauschildt and Vries found that ethical questions are often redacted as clinical assessments to allow doctors to make decisions. Enthusiastrists most often put important decisions in the hands of doctors rather than patients. :14 The communication strategy recommended by the ethicalists acts to reduce patient autonomy. For example, doctors discuss treatment options with one another before talking to patients or their families to present a limited patient autonomy of united fronts, hiding uncertainty among doctors. The decision about the purpose of treatment that is redacted as a technical problem does not include patients and their families. Palliative treatment experts are used as intermediaries to guide patients to a less invasive end - invasive treatment. :11 In their research, Hauschild and Vries found that 76% of ethical consultants were trained as doctors. :12 Learning the approval, Corrigan found that some social processes result in the limitations of patient choices, but also sometimes patients can find questions about approval for burdensome medical trials. Bioethics in Islamic domains differ from Western bioethics, but they also share some of the same point of view. Western bioethics focus on rights, especially individual rights. Islamic bioethics focus more on duty and religious obligation, such as seeking medicine and keeping life alive. Islamic bioethics were strongly influenced and associated with the teachings of the Qur'an as well as the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad.

High values and values are placed on human life in Islam, and in turn, human life is highly valued in the practice of Islamic bioethics as well. Muslims believe that all human life, even those of poor quality, needs to be rewarded and should be cared for and preserved. To react to new technological and medical advances, informed Islamic law experts will regularly hold conferences to discuss new bioethic problems and reach agreements about where they stand in this issue from Islamic perspective. This allows Islamic bioethics to remain flexible and responsive to new advances in medicine. The point of view taken by Islamic law experts on the problem of bioethics is not always a unanimous decision and may sometimes be different. There is a lot of diversity among Muslims that is different from one country to another, and a different level where they obey Sharia. The differences and disagreements in matters of jurisprudence, theology, and ethics between the two major branches of Islam, Sunni, and Shiah, led to the difference in methods and ways in which Islamic bioethics were practiced throughout the Islamic world.

Islamic bioethicists look to the Qur'an and religious leaders about their view of reproduction and abortion. It is firmly believed that the reproduction of human children can be done only properly and legally through marriage. It's not that a child can only be reproduced through sexual relations between a married couple, but the only way that a husband and wife deserve to have a child is when it's an act between husband and wife. It's okay for married couples to have children artificially and from techniques using modern biotechnology as opposed to sexual relations, but doing this outside the context of marriage would be considered immoral. Islamic bioethics strongly oppose abortion and strongly forbid it. IOMS states that \"since the day the zygote settled inside a woman's body, it deserves a unanimous appreciation.\" Abortion is only allowed in unique situations where it is considered to be a \"lighter crime.\" Feminist bioethics criticize the field of bioethics and medicine because of the lack of inclusion of female perspective and other marginalized groups. The lack of perspective of women is thought to create an imbalance in the power that favors men. The imbalance of this power is theorized created from the nature of androsentris medicine. One example of a woman's lack of consideration is in clinical drug trials that exclude women because of hormone fluctuations and possible future birth defects.

Important figures in feminist bioethics include Carol Gillian, Susan Sherwin, and the creator of the International Journal of the Feminist Approach to Bioethics, Mary C. Rawlinson and Anne Donchin. The book Sherwin Is No Longer Patient: Feminist ethics in Health Services (1992) was considered one of the first books published on the subject of feminist bioethics and showed a lack in the theory of bioethics at the time. Sherwin's point of view combines a model of bullying in health care that intends more to remove women, colored people, immigrants, and disabled people.

For example, Homo sapiens, a scientific name for the modern human species, indicates that modern humans belong to the Homo genus. The drafting of a genus is set by a taxonomy. There are no default rules in classification, so there can be a different genera classification among authorized taxonomys. Nevertheless, there are some common practices that are applied, among other things the idea that a genus is not yet established until it meets the following three criteria: In addition, the geneera must be made up of a filogenetic unit of the same type as the other geneera (analogous). This term comes from the Latin genus (\"in origin; type; group; race\"), a noun that is serumous with gignere (\"born\"). Linnaeus popularized his use in his writings Species Plantrum in 1753, but French botanical Joseph Pitton de Tournefort (1656 preserve 1708) was considered the \"conceptor of modern genera\". The scientific name of a genus is also a generic name. This name plays a very important role in the nature of the biological name, the naming of the organism system. The rule for the scientific name of the organism exists in the Nomenclature Code, which is used in all languages, which gives a single Latin name unique to each species. The standard way to describe species and other lower forces is with binomial nomenclatures. Generic name is half of that name.

The time of the extinction of a species is marked by the death of the last individual of the species, although the ability to breed no longer exists. But because of the dispersal area of a species or a taxon that can be so vast, it is very difficult to determine the time of extinction. This challenge can lead to a phenomenon called taxon Lazarus, where a species is thought to be extinct but reappears. About 99 percent of the 5 billion species that have ever lived on Earth, are thought to be extinct. From the estimates of species that live on Earth that are between 10 and 14 million, 1.2 million species are known and the rest are still being studied. Through the process of evolution, new species emerge from a speciation mechanism (English: speciation) where new kinds of organisms emerge and reproduce smoothly when they have ecology niche. The species will go extinct if they can't survive if there's a change in their ecology or if the competition is ever tighter with other stronger organisms. Generally, a species will be extinct within 10 million years, counting from the start of its appearance. Some species, commonly called living fossils, have survived and not changed much over hundreds of millions of years. One example of living fossils is crocodiles. Before man fills the earth, the extinction rate of living things is quite low, although some mass extinctions have occurred before that.

Nitril is found in many useful compounds, including cathypocrylates, used in super glue, and nitril rubber, nitrils containing polymers used in lab latex and medical gloves. Nitril rubber is also widely used in automotives and other seals because of resistance to fuel and oil. The organic compound containing some nitril clusters is known as deanocarbons. The inorganic compound that contains the group \u25aaC counted is not called the nitril, but the cyanide. Although nitril and cyanide can come from cyanide salts, most nitrils are barely toxic. The geometry of N1C-C linear in the nitril, reflects sp hybridization of three carbons. It's a short C1N at 1.16, which is consistent with a threefold. Nitril is a polar, as indicated by the high moment in her pattern. As a liquid, nitril has a high dielectric constant, usually 30s. In amoxition, hydrocarbons are oxidized partly with the presence of ammonia. This conversion is done on a large scale for acrylonitril production: In acrylonitril production, side product is acetonitril. Most derivatives of benzonitril, ftalonitril, and isobutironitril are made with amoxition. This process is catalyzed by metal oxide. Hydrosianation is an industrial method of producing nitril from hydrogen cyanide and alkena. This process requires a homogeneous catalyst. The example of hydrosianation is the production of adiponitril, the precursor nylon.6 of 1.3-butadiena: Aromatic nitril is often made in labs from anilina through diazonium compounds.

Sponges have no nervous system, no digestive or circulatory system. Instead, most rely on the flow of water through their body pores to get food and oxygen and to dispose of waste.

The part of the pinacyte cell can contract or wrinkle, so that the whole animal can become slightly larger or smaller; b) Mesohyl or mesoglea, consisting of such substances that (gelatinous protein matrix), containing bone material and amebocyte cells; c) Choanocyte, which coats atrium or spongocoel. The coanocyte shape is somewhat oval, one end is attached to the mesohyl and the other end is in spongocoel and is equipped with a flagellum surrounded by fibrils. Flagella vibrations in the choanocyte layer produce streams of water in spongocoel toward osculum, while fibril acts as a food catcher. According to the water flow system (not taxonomy), poriferas are divided into three types of Asconoids, Syconoids, and Leuconoids.

Leukonoids are more complex by filling almost the entire hole of the sponge with mesoil, in which there are small coanocytes covered with phallic cells, and these cavitys are connected by small channels, these channels also connect ostium with osculum, so that the flow of water coming in through ostium is driven by conaocytes in these cavitys then directly out into the oskulum, because the number of coanocytes can accelerate the water and increase the size of the sponge.",

Trophozite attacks erythrocytes or other tissues on the host vertebrates. Microgamets and macrogamets are always found in the blood. Gamets will be taken by insect vectors when sucking blood. Microgamets migrate on the digestive tracts of insect vectors and perform fusion with macrogamets. Fertilized macrogamet will be the oopinet that penetrates its vector body.

In its development, at the time of the Reformation, Jonah was considered one of the examples of \"the envy of the Jews.\" Today's Bibleologists generally view the Book of Jonah as a fiction and often a satirical tale, but Jonah's character may be based on the same prophet mentioned in 2 Kings 14:25.

Although the term \"paus\" is sometimes used in several versions of the book of Jonah, the original Hebrew text uses the term dag gadol, meaning \"giant fish.\"",

        "paragraph": "In the 17th and early 18th centuries, the species of fish that swallowed Jonah became the subject of debate among naturalists, who regarded the story as a historical record. A number of modern folklore experts have discovered that there are a number of similarities between Jonah and other legendary figures, such as Gilgames and Ison. Jonah's name is four times in the Qur'an, and his account is in the Surah of Jonah (10): 98, Al-Anbiya' (21): 87-88, Ash-Shaffat (37): 139-148, and Al-Qalam (68): 48-50. In the Bible, Jonah's account is mentioned in the Book of Jonah (John) in the Old Testament and at Matthew 12: 38-41 and Luke 11: 29-32 in the New Testament. In Tanach, Jonah's account is mentioned in the Book of the Twelve (Trei Asar). Despite the same point, Jonah's account of Islamic tradition and the Bible differs in chronological order. The Muslim tradition usually mentions that Jonah preached first, then he went and boarded the ship because his call was rejected, then thrown into the sea and swallowed fish. The Bible records that Jonah was directed to Nineveh, but he fled to the ship and was swallowed up by fish. After regurgitating, Jonah went to Nineveh and called its inhabitants. Jonah was a prophet of the kingdom of Israel (Samaria) in the 8th century B.C.E., living during the reign of Samaria's king Jeroboam son of Jehoash. He lived after the time of the Prophet Ilyas (Elia) and Ilysa (Elisa). In the Jews, Jonah was one of the twelve little prophets whose Book became part of the Tanakhs. According to one of the traditions, Jonah was a son to Elijah the prophet, and one king to seven kings. Another tradition believes that Jonah was the daughter of Sunem who was resurrected from the dead by Elisha in 2 Kings 4 and that he was also referred to as the \"Son of Amittai\" (The Truth) because his mother recognized Elisha as a prophet in 2 Kings 17:24.",

Kisai Marvazi, a tenth - century poet, wrote that Jonah's father was seventy years old when Jonah was born and that he died shortly after Jonah's birth, and left nothing for Jonah's mother but a wooden spoon, which turned out to be a symbol of abundance and blessing. It is said that God commanded Jonah to go to the city of Nineveh or Ninawa (Iraq) to call its people who were doing bad things. The Qur'an explains that Jonah came out angry. Some scholars interpreted the verse that Jonah came out of Nineveh in anger because the people did not accept Jonah's call. And Jonah warned them of the punishment. Only after Jonah got out did the residents come to their senses and repent. Its version adds that when Jonah came out of the sky, it became dark, a sign of what he had been promised. But they turned to God in repentance, so He seized them for their sins. Jonah himself boarded the boat after getting out of Nineveh. Some scholars argue that Jonah boarded the ship before going to Nineveh. The Bible says that Jonah boarded a ship before going to Nineveh. He was ordered by God to call the people of Nineveh, but instead escaped from \"the presence of God\" by going to Jaffa (sometimes translated into Jopppa or Joppe), and sailing towards Tarshish. After boarding the ship, a great storm appeared and the crew realized that the storm was not just a storm, throwing lots and finding that Jonah was wreaking havoc on them. Jonah acknowledged it and said that if he was thrown into the sea, the storm would stop.",

As a result, the storm subsided and the crew offered sacrifices to God. Amazingly, Jonah survived because he was swallowed by a giant fish, and he spent three days and three nights in the belly of the fish. While in the belly of the fish, Jonah prayed to God in his suffering and promised to make an offering and pay what he had promised. God then ordered the fish to spit Jonah out. And when Jonah repented, he said, \"There is no god but You. Glory be to You! I was indeed one of the wrongdoers.\" Indeed, Jonah will be stationed in it until the Day they are resurrected. The ninth - century Persian historian Ath-Thabari stated that although Jonah was in the fish, \"no bone or body parts were injured.\" Ath-Thabari also wrote that God made the body of the fish transparent, thus enabling Jonah to see \"the beauty of the deep sea \" and that Jonah heard all the fish praising God. After some time in the fish, Jonah was vomited on the barren land in sickness. Then God caused to grow for Jonah a plant called \"Yaqthhinah.\" Some scholars interpret that yaqthiah is a plant of a type of pumpkin. The Bible explains that the Lord again commanded Jonah to go to Nineveh and cry out to the inhabitants of that city. And it came to pass this time, that he went into the city, and cried out, It shall be forty days, and Nineveh shall be destroyed. After Jonah walked through Nineveh, the Ninevites began to believe his words and proclaim a fast.",

The whole city humbled itself and finished its work, and the inhabitants of the city were clothed with sackcloth and in ashes. Yet, Jonah was upset that God did not punish the Ninevites who were considered enemies of Israel. Jonah then prayed and, in prayer, said about his departure to Tarshish while conveying that, because God is loving, he knew that God would undo the calamity he was about to bring. Jonah then left Nineveh and built a cottage, awaiting whether the city would be destroyed or not. God made a plant (in Hebrew, kikyon) grow above Jonah's hut to protect it from sunlight. Then, God made a caterpillar bite the roots of the plant, and the plant withered. Jonah, who was now exposed to the intense heat of the sun, limped and begged God to kill him. While in Muslim tradition, Jonah was usually told of calling the people of Nineveh before boarding the ship. When he was thrown out of the fish and ordered to return to Nineveh, the people were in a state of repentance. The book of Jonah is recited every year in its original Hebrew, on the day of Yom Kippur, as a Haftariah in the day of Minchah. According to Rabbi Eliezer, the fish that swallowed Jonah was created in the primordial era and the inside of the fish's mouth was like a synagogue; its eyes were like windows and a jewel in its mouth gave added lighting.

A medieval Jewish rabbi named Abraham ben Ezra (1092 \u25aa 1167) opposed any literal interpretation of Jonah's book, stating that \"the experience of all the prophets, except Moses, was a vision, not a real event. \" However, a scholar named Isaac Abarbanel (1437 \u25aa 1509) thought that Jonah could easily survive in the belly of a fish for three days, since \"fetus lived for nine months without fresh air. \" Teshuva (the possibility of repentance and forgiveness by God) is one of the main ideas in Jewish thinking. Jonah, son of truth, his father's name, \"Amitai\" means truth in the Hebrew language, won't tell the Ninevites to repent. He sought only the truth, and not forgiveness. The Lord said to Jonah: \"Are you angry because of that distance tree?\" He said, \"I am angry to death. And the LORD said unto him, Thou hast loved the oak, which thou didst not toil nor toil, which thou didst not grow in one night, and perished in one night.

On the basis of the interpretation of the Jews, these men sought not the truth while they were religious, but only comfort, and this led to Jonah's escape. Jonah is called twice in the fourteenth chapter of the Tobit Book. In the final part of the book, Tobias, son of Tobit, at the age of 127, rejoiced in the news of Nineveh's destruction at the hands of Nebuchadnezzar and Ahasuerus, who was the fulfillment of Jonah's prophecy against the Assyrian capital. Jonah is mentioned in the New Testament at Matthew 12:38:41 and Matthew 16:4 as well as at Luke 11:29\u25aa32. In Matthew's Gospel, Jesus referred to Jonah when certain scribes and Pharisees asked him for a sign. Jesus said that the sign to be given was Jonah's sign: Jonah's exit from the belly of the great fish after three days before his own resurrection. And he said unto them, This wicked and unfaithful army calleth for a sign. But to them there would be no sign but the sign of the prophet Jonah. For as Jonah dwells in the belly of the great fish three days and three nights, so will the Son of Man dwell in the womb of the earth three days and three nights. At the time of judgment, the Ninevites will rise up with this generation and punish it also; for the Ninevites repented after hearing Jonah's preaching, and indeed what is here is more than Jonah.\" Matthew 12:41-42 and Luke 11:31:32 made sure, with similar words, that Jesus was more than Jonah and more than Solomon.

Jonah was celebrated as a prophet in the Holy One's Calendar in the Lutheran Church of Missouri on September 22. Christian theologians have long interpreted Jonah as a sign for Jesus Christ. The swallowing of Jonah by the giant fish was regarded as a sign of Jesus ' crucifixion and Jonah's vomiting on the beach by the fish was seen as similar to Jesus ' resurrection. Saint Hyeronymus likened Jonah to the nationalistic side of Jesus, and justified Jonah's actions with the opinion that \"Yunus acted as a patriot, not because he hated the Ninevites, but because he refused to destroy his own people.\" Other Christian thinkers, such as Saint Augustine and Martin Luther, took the opposite approach. According to them, Jonah was an expression of the envy of the heart and of jealousy, which they considered to be a quality that adhered to the Jews. Luther also concluded that we represent Judaism, and the worm that eats the tree represents Christ. In addition, Luther questioned the idea that the Book of Jonah was intended as a real history.

Although Luther carefully stressed that Jonah's book was not written by Jonah himself, Calvin stated that Jonah's book was Jonah's personal confession of guilt.

Hooper condemned the dissidents, saying: \"Can you live a quiet life with people like Jonah? No, throw them overboard!\" In the eighteenth century, German professors were obliged to teach the Book of Jonah as a literal historical record.

A similar incident is related in Lukianos of Samosata's Alethe Diegemata, written in the second century A.D., and in Baron Munchausen's Narrative of his Marvellous Travels and Campaigns in Russia, published by Rudolf Erich Raspe in 1785. The story of a survivor being swallowed by a whale or a giant fish is grouped in number 1889G ATU.

Although a number of Bible scientists think that the size and habits of the white shark fit more closely with the figure of the fish that swallowed Jonah, in general an adult man is too large to be swallowed whole by a white shark. The rise in whaling from the 18th century and so on made clear the fact that most whale species were not able to swallow a human being, causing much controversy about the truth of Jonah's story in the Bible.

However, he translated k\u00e9tos into ventre ceti at Matthew 12:40: this second case occurs only in this New Testament verse. Once upon a time, cetus became the same as \"paus\" (studi about whales now called cetology).

Since then, Jonah's \"big fish\" 2 has been referred to most often as a whale. A number of English translations use the word \"paus\" for Matthew 12:40, while others use the term \"sea creature\" or \"big fish.\" In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, naturalists, who spoke of Jonah as historical stories, became obsessed with trying to find a species of fish that swallowed Jonah. In the middle of the nineteenth century, Edward Bouverie Pusey, professor at Oxford University, stated that the Book of Jonah must have been written by Jonah himself and argued that the story of the fish must have been historically true, for otherwise it would not have been included in the Bible. Pusey tried to catalog the fish scientifically, hoping to \"disgrace those who call Jonah's miracles in the belly of the fish as something more absurd than any other miracle of God.\" The debate over the fish in Jonah's book played an important role in a hearing in a courtroom conducted by Clarence Darrow against William Jennings Bryan during the Scopes Court in 1925.",

The classic tools used to study the network are paraffin blocks, where tissue is attached, cut, colored, then observed under a microscope. The development of technology such as the use of electron microscopes and immunophluoresens allows for ever more detailed view of tissue. Networks are owned by organisms that already have the task division for each cell group. Organisms are intertwined, like algae and fungi, with no difference in tissue, although they can form distinctive organs, such as fruit and sporofor bodies. The moss plant is said to have a clear network, although it doesn't have a clear network of vessels yet. In animals, tissue is grouped into four basic types, which are epitel tissue, binding tissue, muscle tissue, and neural tissue. Although all animals are generally thought to contain these four types of tissues, their manifestations can depend on different kinds of organisms. There was a difference during the development of an organism that gave rise to the difference in the origin of the cell and the tissue of its body. Epitels of all animals are derived from the ectoderm and endoderm layers, as well as a small portion of mesoderm, which form the endotelium, a special type of epitel that builds blood vessels. On the other hand, true epitel networks are found only in one layer of cells put together by a connection called a tight connection, to create selectively impenetrable barriers.

The cells that form the epitel layer are connected through a semipermeable tight connection; therefore, the tissue becomes a barrier between the outer environment and the organs it wraps around. In addition to this protective function, epitel tissue can also be devoted to function in secretion, excretion, and absorption. epitel tissue helps to protect organs from microorganisms, injuries, and loss of fluid. The epitel tissue consists of three types of exotelium that wraps the outer body, the endotelium that coats the body's organs, and the mesotelium that restricts the body's cavity. There are various epitel - tissue functions: There are many different types of epitels and namings. Generally, the classification scheme combines the description of the cell form with a word that shows the number of layers: simple (one cell layer) or multistory (some cell layer). However, other cellular characteristics such as silia can also be explained in the classification system. Some common epitels are found among the simple epitel squimose epitels, storied epitels, simple barboid epitel transitions, epitel columner semu (also known as columnary epitel silia, epitel columner, and epitel glands. The binding network is a fibrosa network made up of cells separated by lifeless materials, called extracellular matrix. This matrix can be liquid or rigid.

The neural tissue is tasked with receiving both inside and outside of the body to be delivered to the brain, and then it brings the reaction the brain ordered to certain organs. The nerve cells are made up of cells and nerve fibers. Long nerve fibers are called neurits and short nerve fibers called dendrites (dendrons). Neurits function to pass the stimuli from the cells to other neurons or to body parts. Dendrite acts as an instigator of other neurons or from body parts to cell body. Plant tissue is relatively homogeneous than animal tissue. Plants don't have the locomotion/move capabilities actively as animals do. Nevertheless, many new cells form for various tissues as compensation for the number of dead cells, which are passive because they play a role as energy reserve cells (e. g. on fruit or umb.) or in secondary metabolic, and to fill new tissues because plants are constantly growing in mass, especially in annual vegetation. The active network replicates itself and has no special function called a meristematic network, while the stable network with its function is called a constant/permanent network. The meristemic network consists of meristem cells, an analog of animal stem cells. These tissues can be found on the tip of stems and roots (called meristems), under the bark (as cambium corks and vessels, called edges of edges, and on the edge of fields or books, as well as on the trunks of leaf stalks (merems between/intercalar).",

Meristematic tissues also form when there is an open part of vegetation, for example, because of injuries. Mobilizations of some fitohormon, usually auksin and cytoxins, will trigger the formation of meristem cells that form a kind of unbiased network called klaus. Permanent networks are categorized into three major groups: epidermis (protective networks, consisting of cells that make up the outer layers of leaves and parts of the young vegetation), the transporter's networks (conserting xilem and floem), and the basic network (contesting parentim, chlorenkim, collenkim, and sklerenkim). Epidermis protects the inside of the organ so as not to be directly touched by the effects of outside organs. Epidermis can be protected by a thin layer on the outside known as the cuticle. It can also be found a layer of night. Epidermis cells are usually rectangular when viewed from the side, parallel homogeneous. However, epidermis can undergo a transformation into covering cells or stomata guard cells along with some neighboring cells, trichoma (mites or hairs of leaves), thorns, and gland hair. The transporter's network is housed by a tentative plant (Tracheophyta). Gymnospermae has a network of tracheides, tracheide fibers, and wood parenkim as a xilem builder. Angiospermae has an additional trachea network other than Gymnospermae's. Floems are composed of tapyel tissue and escort cells. Basic tissues make up most of the plant's body (biomassa). This network has many functions depending on where it is. Often he fills in the largest parts of an organ, putting together fruit meat, bark, bulbic contents that store certain secondary starches or metabolics (such as alkaloids and terpenoids). It can also experience death by emptying out the contents of its cells to form a hollow structure (aerenkim) like a bubble chamber in a hymen or a hollow cavity in a bamboo reed.",

The controversy of siliconic properties dates back to its discovery: silicon was first made in its pure form in 1824 in the name of silisium (from Latin: sylicis), with the suffix -ium meaning metal. Even so, in 1831, his name was changed to silicon because his physical traits were more like carbon and boron. Silicon is the eighth - largest element in the universe in terms of its mass, but it is rarely found in pure form in nature.

Silicon is also an essential element of biology, even though animals need very little. Some types of living things that need it include poriferas and diatoms of microorganisms. Silicon is used to make their body structure. The silicon is solid at room temperature, with boiling points and boiling points each 1,400 and 2,800 degrees centigrade. Interestingly, silicon has greater types of mass when in its liquid form than in its solid form. But like most other substances, silicon won't mix when it's in its solid phase, but it's just expanding, just like the ice that has a mass kind of smaller than water. Because of its high thermal conduction (149 W\u00b7m1\u00b7K\u00b7K1), silicon is such a fluctuating heat that it is never used to insulate hot objects.

Responsive responses are usually manifested in the form of behavior that arises after an outbreak. The theory of Beaviorism uses a response term that is attached to the stimulated process of describing the formation of behavior. Responsive is the behavior that arises because of the environmental stimulatement. If the stimulated and the response is paired or conditioned it will form a new behavior toward the conditioned stimulated. The cognitive approach emphasizes that behavior is a mental process, where individuals are active in capturing, judging, comparing, and responding to stimulus before they react. Individuals receive stimulus and then perform a mental process before reacting to the stimulus.

Sigmund Freud believes that individual life is largely ruled by the subconscious. So that behavior is based on things that are not conscious, like desires, impulses, or impulses.

Crisis can also trigger a wide range of emotional reactions, such as fear, sadness, guilt, etcetera. Emotions or feelings are an important part of our lives. Feelings can be positive or negative; for example, there is nothing wrong with feelings of sadness after losing a family member.

This grouping was first published by Carl Jung (1920) in his book Psychologicalsche Typen. In general, extroverts get a passion for social interaction. Extroverts usually have an open, social personality, and a high concern for what is happening around them. While introverts, on the other hand, are considered to have a passion for passing alone. Introverts, usually tend to be quiet, brooding, and more concerned about their thinking in their own world. Among the extreme trends of introversion and extroversion are ambiditions that are intermediate personalities between extroverts and introverts. Despite the contrast between introverts and extroverts, Carl Jung thought that humans were rarely completely extroverted or introverted.

However, observers usually see only bows shaped by droplets of light above the ground, and center on lines from the sun to the observer's eyes. In the primary rainbow, the bow shows red on the outside and purple on the inside. This rainbow is caused by light that is made when it enters the drop of water. Then it bounces in at the back of the droplets and refurbishes on the way out. In a double rainbow, the second bow is seen outside the primary bow and in reverse color, with red on the inside of the bow. This is caused by light reflected twice on the inside of the drip before leaving it. The rainbow is not located at a certain distance from the observer, but it comes from an optical illusion caused by a drop of water seen from a certain angle relative to the source of light. Thus, rainbows are not objects and are not physically accessible. Granted, it is not possible for observers to see rainbows from water droplets at any angle other than the usual 42 degrees in the opposite direction of light sources.

Nickels include transitional metals, and they have a strong and tenacious nature. Nickel is also included in a metal-cobalt group, which can produce a very valuable blend. Pure Nickel powder-shaped to maximize the reactive surface area, has significant chemical activity, but large pieces react slowly with air in normal conditions because oxidized layers form on the surface and prevent further corrosion. Even so, pure nickels are found only in the earth's crust in small amounts, usually in ultrabasa rocks, and inside iron meteorites or siderites that are not exposed to oxygen while outside the Earth's atmosphere. The Nickel inside the meteorite was found along with the iron, which came from a supernova. Condensation of the ironworks of Tirzahnikel is thought to form the outer core and core of the earth. The use of nickels starts at 3500 BC. Nickel was first classified as a chemical element in 1751 by Axel Fredrik Cronstedt, who initially thought the ore was a copper mineral, at a cobalt mine in Los, H\u00e4lsingland, Sweden. The name of this element comes from a rogue fairy of German miner mythology, Nickel (Like Old Nick), which categorizes the fact that the copper ore JUNInikel cannot be refined into copper. Economicly important source of nickel is the iron ore of the limonit, which contains 11002% of the nickel. Other important nickel ore Minerals include pentlanditites and a mixture of natural nickel - rich silicates known as garnierits. The main production site is located in the Canada area of Sudbury (presumed to be from meteorites), New Caledonia, and Norilsk in Russia.",

About 9% used for corrosion-resistant nickel layers. A nickel-coated object sometimes triggers a nickel allergy. Nickel used a lot of it in coins, although prices have caused nickel replacements with cheaper metals in the last few years. Nickel is one of the four elements (others are iron, cobalt, and gadolinium) that are feromagnetic at normal temperatures. Alnico permanent magnets containing nickels have a medium strength between permanent iron magnets and rare earth magnets. A combination of nickel, chrome and iron produces rust - resistant steel (stainless steel) that is applied heavily to kitchen utensils (cooks, and cooking utensils), ornaments of homes and buildings, and industrial components. Nickels are important in modern times, especially for alloy; about 68% are used for rustproof steel. 10% used for nickel alloys, 7% for alloy steel, 3% for casting, 9% for layering and 4% in other uses, which includes fast-growing battery sectors. As a compound, nickels have the use of making special chemicals, such as catalysts for hydrogenation (for this use of nickel raccoons), cathodes for batteries, pigments, and metal surface treatments. Nickel is an essential nutrient for parts of microorganisms and plants that have enzymes with nickels as active sites.

Nickel Ragey, a finely divided nickel-aluminium alloy, is one of the common forms, although the Catalyst is also used, including the Raney type Catalyst. Nickel is a natural magnetic material, which means, if there's a magnetic field, it has a little bit of a long change. The nickel magnetostriction is about -50 ppm, which indicates that the nickel is contracting. Nickel was used as a binder in the cement-wolfram industry carbide or hard metal and was used in proportions of 6% to 12% weight. Nickel made the wolfram carbide magnetic and added corrosion to the cemented part, although the violence was less than the cobalt binding. 63Ni, with 100.1 years' time, is useful in a krytron device as a beta particle transmitter (high-speed electron) to make ionization with fixed electrodes more reliable. About 27% of all nickel production is intended for engineering, 10% for building and construction, 14% for tubular products, 20% for metals, 14% for transportation, 11% for electronics, and 5% for other uses. Runney's nickel mix is widely used for unsatisfied oil hydrogenation to make margarine. Bad Margarin and the rest of the oil may contain nickels as contaminations. Forte dkk. found that type 2 diabetes patients have 0.89ng/ml Ni in the blood compared to 0.77ng/ml on the control subject. Although unknown until the 1970s, nickels played an important role in the lives of some plants, eubacteria, archabeacteria, and mushrooms. A nickel enzyme such as the urge is considered to be a virulence factor in some organisms. Urease catalyses urea hydrolysis to form ammonia and carbamat. NiFe hydrogenase can catalyze H2 oxidation to form protons and electrons, and it can also catalyze feedback, which is the reduction of protons to form hydrogen gas.",

Food Nickels can affect human health through infections from nickel-dependent bacteria, but nickels may be essential nutrients for bacteria in the colon, which serve as prebiotics. The U.S. Institute of Medicine has yet to confirm that nickel is an important nutrient for humans, therefore neither the Gizi Needs (AKG) nor the Infected Feeds. The top feed limit of the nickel of the food is 1000 per day as the soluted nickel salt. The nickel feed of food is estimated to be 70 to 100 per day, from that, less than 10% absorbed. What is absorbed is secreted in urine. The relatively large amount of nickel - comparable to the estimated average consumption of the above - flows into food cooked in stainless steel pots. For example, the amount of nickels that are filtered after a portion of tomato sauce is cooked 10 times an average of 88 \u25aag. The Nickel released from volcanic eruptions in Siberian Traps allegedly helped the growth of Methanosarcinales, the genus archaea euryarchaeote that produced methane during the Perm-Trias extinction event, the largest event of extinction ever recorded. The main source of nickel exposure is oral consumption, since nickel is very important to plants.

Most of the nickels absorbed daily by humans are removed by kidneys and removed from the body through urine or dumped through digestive tracts without being absorbed. Nickel is not a cumulative poison, but a greater dose or exposure to chronic inhalation may be dangerous, even carcinogenic, and poses a danger of employment. A nickel compound is classified as a human carcinogen based on increased risk of respiratory cancer observed in the study of epidemiologists distilling sulfide ore. This is supported by positive results from the NTP bioassay with sub-sulfida Ni and Ni oxide on rats. Human and animal data show the absence of carcinogenicity through oral consumption and limited carcinogenicity of nickel compounds that cause respiratory tumors after being inhaled. A nickel metal is thought to be a carcinogen; there is a consistency between the risk of normal respiratory cancer in workers who are exposed mostly to metal nickels and lack of respiratory tumors in carcinogenity studies with nickel inhalation in mice with nickel metal powder.

Although the population is enormous, it still gives the average PNB per person only about $5,000, about 1/7 of the United States. The official economic growth report for 2003 is 9.1%. It is estimated by the CIA in 2002 that agriculturals donated 14.5% of China's PNB, industry and construction are about 51.7% and services are approximately 33.8%. The average rural income is about a third in urban areas, a difference that has widened over the last decade. Because of its vast size and its vast history of culture, RRT has a tradition of being a nation of economic rulers. In Ming Zeng's words, Shanghai's board professor, in part statistics, at the end of the 16th century, RRT had a third of GDP. The mighty United States of America today has only 20%. So if you make this historical comparison, three or four hundred years ago, China is definitely the world's greatest power. The attempt to re-enact this proud state is certainly one of the Chinese's goals. So it's no wonder the world's non-Chinese phenomenon is willing to learn this Chinese language and American and Western fury toward China in general in today's political scenario. However, the chasm of wealth collection between the coastal and the interior area of China is still enormous. To match this potentially dangerous situation, the government carried out the Western Chinese Development Strategy in 2000, North East China Restoration in 2003, and the Rebirth of Central China in 2004, all in order to help China to build together.",

It is also estimated that there are 7% of the Christian population and 1% of the Islamic population in this country. The country has long experienced population growth problems. In an effort to limit the population's development, RRT has taken a policy that limits families in urban areas (unexcepted minorities) to one child and a family in the interior could have two children, when the first woman. Since men are considered more economical in rural areas, high incidents arise about gender - selective abortion and child rejection in rural areas to ensure that the second child is a male. This base is for the majority of Han people. There are many homes for these abandoned children, but only 2% of them are adopted by others. The rest of them grew up in the orphan's home. RRT has requested an international adoption program, where other citizens of the country have come to appoint them, but this program shows unsatisfactory results.

In other words, meditation releases us from the sufferings of good thinking and bad, which are very subjective, proportionally related directly to our attachment to certain thoughts and judgments.

The benefits of meditation that we can do can be directly or indirectly felt physically. One of the benefits that we get, if we suffer from a certain illness. From a physiological point of view, meditation is the best anti-stress. When you experience stress, heart rate and blood pressure increases, breathing becomes fast and short, and adrenaline glands pump stress hormones.

In the periodic table, oxygen is a nonlogamic element of the VIA class (calcogen) and can easily react with almost all other elements (e.g. oxide). At standard temperature and pressure, two oxygen atoms bond to O (dioxygenated), colorless, tasteless, odorless gases. Oxygen is the third most abundant element in the universe based on mass (after hydrant and helium) and the most abundant element in the Earth's crust. Based on the volume, 20.9% of the earth's atmosphere is oxygen. All groups of organic molecules in living things, such as proteins, carbohydrates, and fats, contain oxygen elements. So are the inorganic compounds found in the shells, teeth, and bones of animals. Most of the oxygen in living things is in the form of water (H2O), an essential compound in living things. Oxygen in O's form is produced from water by phanobacterial, algae, and plants during photosynthesis, and used in cell respiration by virtually all living things. Oxygen is toxic to anaerob organisms, which are the most dominant life-forms of the early evolution of life. O then began to accumulate in the atmosphere about 2.5 billion years ago. There are other oxygen alotrotropics, the ozone (O). The ozone layer of the atmosphere helps to protect the biosphere from ultraviolet radiation, but on the surface of the earth it is a pollutant that is a by - product of asbut.

The term oxygen was created by Antoine Lavoisier in 1777, whose experiments with oxygen successfully brought down the well - known theory of burning flogiston and corrosion. He also managed to explain the role oxygen plays in burning. Industrial oxygen is produced by liquid air distilation, using zeolith to separate carbon dioxide and nitrogen from the air, or hydrolysis, etc. Oxygen is used in the production of steel, plastic, and textiles, and it is also used as a rocket programmer, for oxygen therapy, and as a life support on airplanes, submarines, spaceships, and dives. One of the first known experiments on the relationship between burning and air was carried out by Philo of Byzantium, a 2nd - century B.C.E. Greek writer of mechanics. In his work Pneutica, Philo observed that flipping a container over a burning candle and putting water under the neck of the ship caused water to rise to the neck. Philo mistakenly suspected that the passage of air in the vessel was transformed into a flame of classical elements and thus exited through pores in the glass. At first, scientists thought that air was one of four elements and was not a mixture of gases, as scientists now know. Hence, at first scientists did not know of oxygen as one of the components of the air. Leonardo da Vinci, who lived in 1452 JUNE1519, observed that some of the air was used in the process of burning and breathing, and with no fire air or living things would die. At the end of the 17th century, Robert Boyle proved that air was needed in the process of burning. British chemist John Mayow completed Boyle's work by showing that only part of the air component he referred to as spiritus nitroaeeus or nitroereus is needed in the burning.",

From this experiment, he concluded that nitroereus was used in the process of respiration and burning. Mayow observed that antimon weight would increase when heated. He concluded that nitroereus must have joined the antimony. He also thought that the lungs separate nitroereus from the air and transport it into the blood, and animal heat and muscle movement would result in nitroereus reactions to certain substances in the body. Reports like this and thoughts and other experiments were published in 1668 in his work Tractatus duo on the \"De recspiratione\" section. In Robert Hooke's experiments, Ole Borch, Mikhail Lomonosov, and Pierre Bayen, their experiments all produced oxygen, but none of them recognized it as an element. This is likely caused by a prevalence of burning philosophy and corrosion known as the flogiston theory. The flogiston theory was presented by German alchemist J. J. Becher in 1667, and was modified by the chemist Georg Ernst Stahl in 1731. The flogiston theory states that all combustible materials are made of two parts components. One of them was flogiston, released when the material was burned, while the remaining parts of it after it was the original form of the matter. The materials that burn hard and leave little residue (for example of wood and coal), are considered to have very high levels of flogiston, whereas non-burnable and corrosive materials (for example), contain very few flogistons.

The fact that woodlike matter actually gains weight in the process of burning is covered by the floating force that is owned by the burning product of the gas. In fact, the fact that metal gets heavier when it rusts becomes an early clue that the flogiston theory is not true (which, according to the theory of the flogiston, the metal will become lighter). Michael Sendivogius (Micha\u0142 S\u25aadziw\u00f3j), an alchemist, philosopher, and physician from Poland, in his work De Lapide Philosophorum Tractatus duodecim e naturae et experientia depromti (in 1604) describes a substance contained in the air, which he called 'cibus vitae' (living force), and is identical to oxygen. Sendivogius, during his experiments conducted between 1598 and 1604, recognized precisely that the substance was equivalent to a by - product of gas released by the thermal decomposition of potassium nitrate. In Bugaj's view, the proper isolation of oxygen and association of the substance into the air part needed for life, is sufficient evidence for oxygen discovery by Sedivocius. However, the discovery of the centivogis is often disputed by the next generation of scientists and chemists. Oxygen was first discovered by a drug expert Carl Wilhelm Scheele. It generates oxygen gas by heating mercury oxide and various nitrates around 1772. Scheele called this gas 'air fire' because he was the only gas known to support combustion.

Because he published his discovery first, Priestley was usually given first priority in the discovery of oxygen. A French chemist, Antoine Laurent Lavoisier later claimed that he had found new substances independently. Priestley, however, visited Lavoisier in October 1774 and told Lavoisier about his experiments and how he produced the new gas. Scheele also sent a letter to Lavoisier on September 30, 1774, explaining his discovery of an unknown substance, but Lavoisier never admitted the letter (a copy of this letter was found in Scheele's personal effects after his death).

He noted that the air quickly entered the container as soon as he opened the container. This indicates that some of the air in the container has been consumed. He also noted that the weight of the lead had also increased and that this increase was as heavy as the air that came into the container. These experiments along with experiments on other burnings were documented into his book Sur la combustion en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral published in 1777. His work proves that air is a mixture of two gases, vital air, which is necessary in burning and respiration, as well as azote, which does not support burning or respiration. Azote then became what is called nitrogen, although in French and some other European languages still use the name Azote. Lavoisier renamed the vital air oxyg\u00e8ne in 1777. The name comes from the Greek root of \u25aa (oxys) (asam, literally \"sharp\") and - He named it that way because he believed that oxygen was a component of all acids.

For example, Dalton assumes that the water formula is HO, so the atomic mass of oxygen is 8 times the mass of hydrogen (the actual value is 16). In 1805, Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac and Alexander von Humboldt showed that water was formed of two hydrogen volumes with one oxygen volume; and in 1811, based on what is now called the Avogadro law and the assumption of the diatomic molecule, Amedeo Avogadro estimated water composition correctly.a] At the end of the 19th century, scientists realized that the air could be melted and its components could be separated by compressing it and cooling it. Swiss chemist and physicist Raoul Pierre Pictet evaporated sulfur dioxide to melt carbon dioxide, which was eventually applied to cool oxygen gas into liquid. He sent a telegram on December 22, 1877, to the French Academy of Sciences in Paris and announced his discovery of liquid oxygen. Two days later, French physicist Louis Paul Cailletet announced his method of melting molecular oxygen. Only a few drops of liquid are produced so that no meaningful analysis can be performed. Oxygen was successfully melted into a stable state for the first time on March 29, 1877, by Polish scientists from the University of Jagiellonian, Zygmunt Wr\u00f3blewski and Karol Olszewski.

At standard temperature and pressure, oxygen is a colorless, odorless, odorless gas, and tasteless molecular formula O, called dioxygen, where two oxygen atoms are chemically linked to the configuration of a spin triplet electron. This bond has a double bond and is often described simply as a double bond or as a combination of one two electron bond with two three electron bonds. As dioxygenated, two oxygen atoms are bound to each other. Binding can be described by the level of theory, but it is generally described as a covalent double bond produced from the charging of molecules that form from the orbital of oxygen atoms, which charge them to produce a two-bond order.

According to its mass, oxygen is the most abundant chemical element in the earth's biosphere, air, sea, and soil. Oxygen is the third most abundant chemical element in the universe, after hydrogen and helium. About 0.9% of the mass of the Sun is oxygen. Oxygen fills about 49.2% of the earth's crust mass and is a major component of the ocean (88.8% by mass). Oxygen gas is the second most common component in the Earth's atmosphere, occupying 21.0% volume and 23.1% mass (about 1015 tons) of atmosphere.d] The Earth has inequalities in its atmosphere compared to other planets in its solar system because it has a high concentration of oxygen gas in its atmosphere. Compare it to Mars that only has 0.1% O based on volumes and Venus which have even lower concentration levels. However, O is on planets other than the earth only produced from ultraviolet radiation that affects oxygen-moleum molecules, such as carbon dioxide. This unusual concentration of oxygen gas on Earth is the result of the oxygen cycle. This biogeochemical cycle explains the movements of oxygen inside and between the three earth's main reservoirs: the atmosphere, the biosphere, and the lithosphere. The main factor that drives the oxygen cycle is photosynthesis. Photosynthesis releases oxygen into the atmosphere, when respiration and decomposition removes it from the atmosphere. In a state of uncertainty, the production rate and consumption of oxygen is about 1/2000 of the entire oxygen that is in the atmosphere every year.",

Scientists assess the quality of water by measuring the need for biological oxygen or the amount of O is needed to restore the concentration of oxygen in the water to its original state. Paleoklimatologists measure the ratio of oxygen-18 and oxygen-16 in the shells and skeletons of marine organisms to determine the climate millions of years ago (see the cycle of the isotopes of oxygen ratio). Sea water molecules containing a lighter isotope, oxygen-16, evaporate a little faster than water molecules containing oxygen-18, which weighs 12% more than oxygen-16, and these differences increase at lower temperatures. During a lower global temperature period, snow and rain from water evaporates tends to be higher in oxygen-16, and abandoned seawater tends to be higher in oxygen-18. Sea organisms then put more oxygen-18 into its skeleton and shell than in warmer climates. Paleoklimatologists also directly measure this ratio in the water molecules of the ice core samples that are up to hundreds of thousands of years old. Planetary geologists have measured the relative amount of isotopes of oxygen in samples from Earth, Moon, Mars, and meteorites, but can not long get reference value for the isotopes ratio in the Sun, which is believed to be the same as those in the ancient nebula.

The measurements are technically difficult because the low signal-to-noise ratio and the physical structure of vegetation; but it's proposed as a possible method to monitor the carbon cycles of satellites on a global scale. In nature, free oxygen is produced from photolysis of water during oxygenic photosynthesis. Green and phanobacterial gangs in the ocean environment produce about 70% of the free oxygen produced on earth, while the rest are produced by land plants. The simple chemical equation for photosynthesis is: or simpler: photolithic oxygen evolution occurs in the thylakoid membrane of the organism and requires four photon energy.e] There are many steps to the process involved, but the result is the formation of proton gradient across the thylapod surface.

According to the World Fund for Nature, the Andorra region is part of the Pirenia ecology and mixed forest. Andorra has alpine, Continental, and ocean climates, depending on its altitude. The higher a place means that on average there is more snow in winter and cooler in summer. Tengaran diversity, different valley trends, and relief disorder, which is common for the Mediterranean climate, gives the country great diversity in microclimate climates that prevent the general domination of alpine climate. The great diversity of heights in minimum and maximum points, together with the influence of the Mediterranean climate, builds the climate of Pirenia Andorra.

The result of the application of economic principles can be observed through the measure of efficiency that is measured by the comparison between the gains and the expenses needed during economic activity. An economic action is said to be efficient when a result is achieved with the most appropriate and cost-saving sacrifices. The economy is much discussed in a special science known as economic science, in which there is sociology. History, anthropology, and geography. Some parts of the economy of applied science such as production, distribution, commerce, and consumption are also discussed in other sciences such as engineering, management, business administration, applied science, and finance. There are lots of sectors in the economy, which are then grouped into three major sectors which are primary sectors, secondary sectors, and the best sectors. Microeconomics is a branch of economic science that studies economic activities and economic units in individual coverage. All economic activities are judged from an individual's point of view. In microconomics, individuals act as consumers, owners of production factors, as well as producers. Economic analysis is done entirely on the role of individuals from demand and supply to market structure. The analysis activity in the micro economy is generally divided into three which are price theory, production theory, and distribution theory. Included in the primary sector are sectors that directly harness natural resources, including agriculture, forestry, fishing, and mining.",

This sector is usually the main sector, and it contributes the largest in the developing world economy. However, there is a decline in the number of workers operating in this sector, both in the developed world and in the developing world. In the United States, the labor force in this sector covers only about 3% of the total labor force. From the primary sector, raw materials are processed by the secondary sector, which is the sectors that produce, and create final products that are ready to be consumed, including production sectors and construction. This sector is usually divided into two categories, which are light industries and heavy industries. The industry in this sector usually uses enormous energy to operate and produce wastes that are also large, causing environmental or pollution problems. Countries with large secondary sectors are referred to as industrial states, including RRT, United States, Japan, Germany, and Russia. Unlike the primary sector, and the tersier sector that creates product shaped, the tersier sector is the service sector that creates the formless product of service to its consumer. The perpetrators of the tersier sector offer knowledge and time to increase productivity, kinjera, and potential in other sectors. Its products include attention, advice, access, experience, and discussion. In addition to the three sectors above, two new sectors are growing as quaterner sectors, and quiners. The quaterner sector is a branch of the tersier sector that focuses on performing intellectual activity. It includes sectors of government, culture, literature, scientific research, education, and information. Meanwhile, the Quiner sector has a deeper focus, which is on sectors in the quaterner sectors that become the primary decision-makers in a society.",

The shekel unit, for example, starts with a unit used to measure the weight of the barley. These units were then used to measure the weight of precious metals such as gold, silver, and copper. The process of transactions was simple, usually between two or more people who were directly involved. The barter system still has a lot of use. As society progresses, the economic systems are being used are increasingly complex. The Sumerian community, for example, developed a large-scale economy based on commodity money. In other places, the Babylonians and surrounding countries developed debt systems, legal contracts, and laws related to business practices and private property. Just as in the old days, in the middle ages economic activities also revolved around the trade in agriculture, and basic goods, as well as in closed social groups. However, some developments occur, including the emergence of groups that capitalize on individuals or other groups, especially for shipping, and the development of territories. This capital will have to be returned in the form of a sale of goods obtained from a colonial state. The process of borrowing, and this money change led to bank pioneering, and the rise of the global economy. Stock trade also came to be known, especially after 1513 after the world's first stock market opened in Antwerp. In this century the money used is already metal coins, especially in Europe, and its surroundings. The type of metal used affects the value of the money, which is most popular in copper, silver, and gold.

One of the most popular systems used back then was the manorial system. The system centers on a manor, a revolving region ruled by a landlord. In this system of things, farmers depend on the landlords where they live, especially in security, and on safety assurances when they engage in economic activities. In exchange for these farmers working for such masters. This system developed mainly in the 5th century, and the 6th century, when disease, and famine caused by war, caused the number of people who had given up the land to be torn away, and fled for refuge elsewhere. Farmers are the most common occupation. They're scattered across manor, serving different masters. Besides farming, farmers also raise goats. The task of taking care of goats is usually done by women, including cutting their hair, making wool, and knitting clothes. Another work that is also popular is artists, including those who produce items made of glass, wood, clay, and iron. There is also service work, including dentists, barbers, teachers, and surgeons. There are also trade classes that develop toward the end of the Middle Ages. The development of this merchant class led to the progress of urban areas. The impact of this progress was especially felt in the 12th century, and the 13th. Although agriculture is still a prime donna, trade classes are beginning to have a huge impact on the economy. Some of them even had political influence, and they formed unions. These unions are used among other things to support tax policies. This union system signifies a change in the direction of a more mature economic system because prices and quality of goods are being regulated.",

Black death also had the same effect the millions of farmers infected with the disease were killed. The result of these two events is the emergence of new systems both in the economy and in agriculture. The easier it is to get the capital to travel, and expand the occupational areas, the economics in such European countries as Spain, France, Britain, and the Netherlands are growing very rapidly. They then try to do control, and protect against trade by making customs. In addition to the ease of capital, the European economy is also at the cost of expanding secularism that allows these countries to use abundant church treasures to develop cities. These advances are followed by major economic projects, among other things that are confirmed by Amschel Mayer Rothschild (1773-1885). Economic topics began to focus on the management of public or state possessions. During the industrial revolution that occurred in the 18th and 19th centuries, great changes took place in agriculture, manufacturing, mining, and transportation. This affects economic social conditions, and culture throughout Europe, the United States, and the rest of the world. Understand freer capitalism appears in place of merchantilism. The industrial revolution itself played a role in the economic development of this century. Economic science was then developed by scientists like Scotsman Adam Smith (1723-1790), which is now recognized as the world's first economist. He introduced the idea that the price of a product is created by the interesting attraction between supply, and demand and labor division.

After the two World Wars broke out, and the economy collapsed, governments in many countries started looking for ways to control the direction of the economy. Some economists such as Friedrich August von Hayek (1899-1992) and Milton Friedman (1912-2006) came up with the importance of a free global trade. But at the time, the idea of John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946) was widely accepted. Keynes believes that the government needs to control the market strongly. Keynes believes that the government can eliminate economic problems, and speed up growth by manipulating the aggregate demand. In honor of his thinking, understand this is called Keynesianism. According to Keynes, the market economy has no mechanism to ensure that everyone can work, resulting in unemployment. Keynes argues that the country needs to intervene, and manipulate demand, and demand aggregate to reduce this negative impact. To do that, Keynes stressed the importance of the government to make investments. If the government increases its spending, the public's money will increase so that the public will be encouraged to shop, and increase its demand (so that the aggregate demand increases). In addition, savings will also increase so that it can be used as investment capital, and economic conditions will return to normal levels. In the 1950s, the economy of Europe and America grew rapidly. This period is referred to as the period of economic wonder. This rapid development carries a new kind of economy: the economy based on mass consumption.

The essence of mankind's economic problems is the fact that human needs are unlimited, whereas human needs are limited. Some factors that influence a person's number of needs differ from the number of others: Economic action is a term that refers to any human endeavor that is plagued by the best, and most profitable choice. for example: My mother cooks with firewood because the price of kerosene is very expensive. Economic action consists of two aspects: Economic motives are a person's reasons or goals so that he engages in economic action. Economic motives are divided in two ways: practice has a number of economic motives: Economic chemistry, economic science, health science, is a guide in doing economic action, which is contained in it with a measure of sacrifice that comes at the maximum cost.

The kind that is preferred for textile industries are internal tampon feathers with different names (down, kasymir and pasymina).

Phosphrous elements exist in two main forms, white phosphorus and red phosphorus, but because they are highly reactive, phosphorus was never found as free elements on Earth. It has a concentration in the Earth's crust of about one gram per kilogram (comprehensive to about 0.06 grams). In minerals phosphorus generally occurs as phosphate. Phosphhorus elements were first isolated as white phosphorus in 1669. The white phosphhorus emits a dim light when exposed to oxygen, so its name is derived from Greek mythology, phosphoros which means 'the bringer of light' (Latin Lucifer), referring to the \"Star of dawn\", the planet Venus. The term phosphorescent, meaning light after illumination, comes from this phosphorus trait, although it has been used for different physical processes that produce light. The phosphorus light is caused by a white phosphorus oxidation (but not red) of a process now called kemiluminescence. Along with nitrogen, arsen, antimon, and bismuth, phosphorus is classified as pniktogen. Phosphrous is an important element for supporting life, mostly through phosphate, a compound containing phosphate ions, PO43. Phosphate is a component of DNA, RNA, ATP, and phospholid, a fundamental complex compound for the cell. Phosphrous elements were first isolated from human urine, and bone ash was an important source of early phosphate. Fosphate mines contain fossils because phosphate is present in fossil deposits of animals and dung. Low phosphate levels are an important limit to growth in some water systems.

It's called phosphoros, but phosphorus in Latin, which means light-bringer because its uniqueness is glow-in-the-dark. and now the results of that discovery have been highly developed and very useful to mankind. In general phosphorus forms sticky white solids that have bad odors but when pure becomes colorless and transparent. This nonlogam is not dissolved in water, but it is dissolved in carbon dissulfida. Pure phosphhorus spontaneously combust in the air forming phosphorus pentoxide. Phosphhorus can be in four forms or more of alotropy: white (or yellow), red, and black (or purple). Most common are red and white phosphorus, both clustered into four tetrahedral atoms. The white phosphhorus burns when it comes to the air and can turn into a red phosphorus when exposed to heat or light. The white phosphhorus can also be in alpha and beta conditions separated by the transitional temperature -3.8 \u00b0C. The red phosphhorus is relatively more stable and immerse at 170 \u00b0C at 1 atm steam pressure, but it burns as a result of collision or friction. Black phosphorus alotro has a graphite-like structure of atoms arranged in layers of hexagonal which conducts electricity. Phosphhorus is often referred to as phosphorus.

Maldives of language, Maldives of scripts, architecture, ruling institutions, customs, and Maldives came from the time Maldives became Buddhist kingdoms. Buddhism probably spread to the Maldives in the 3rd century B.C.E. during the expansion of Emperor Ashoka and became the dominant religion of the Maldives until the 12th century. Ancient Maldive King promoted Buddhism, and the artistic writings and achievements of the first Maldives, in the form of highly developed statues and architecture, came from that period. Almost all the archaeological relics in the Maldives came from stupida and Buddhist convents, and all the artifacts that were discovered until recently featured a typical Buddhist iconography. The Buddhist temple (and Hindu) is shaped in the form of Mandala. They're orientated according to the four main winds with the main gate facing east. Local historian Hassan Ahmed Maniku counted 59 islands with Buddhist archaeological sites on the temporary list he published in 1990. The importance of Arab merchants in the Indian Ocean in the 12th century may have partly explained why the last Buddha king of Maladives, Dhovemi, entered Islam in 1153 (or 1193). Adopted the Muslim title of Sultan al-Adil, he began a series of six Islamic dynasties that lasted until 1932 when the sultanship became an option. The official title of the sultan until 1965 was, Sultan of Land and Sea, Lord of twelve thousand islands and Sultan of Maldives that came in style with His Majesty.",

The British expelled the Netherlands from Ceylon in 1796 and included the Maldives as Britain's Protectorate. The Maldives status of Britain's protectorate is officially recorded in the 1887 treaty where the sultan Muhammad Mueenuddeen II received the influence of the British relations and external defenses of the Maldives while maintaining his internal rule, which is constantly regulated by Muslims through traditional institutions with the rewards of annual tribute. The status of the islands is similar to that of other British protectorates in the Indian Ocean region, including Zanzibar and War Nation. During the British period, the Sultan's reign was taken over by the Chief Minister, who made the Governor-General of England disappointed by the ongoing dealings with the Sultan ineffective. As a result, Britain encouraged the development of the constitutional monarchy, and the first Constitution was proclaimed in 1932. However, the new arrangement did not benefit the old Sultan or the clever Chief Minister, but rather a group of English educated reformers. As a result, angry mobs were incited to oppose the publicly torn Constitution. The Maldives remained England's crown protectorate until 1953 when the sultanship was suspended and the First Republic was declared under the short-lived presidency of Muhammad Amin Didi.

The Republican system was declared on November 11, 1968, thus ending the 853 - year monarchy, which was replaced by the republic under the presidency of Ibrahim Nasir.

Feromagnetism can survive as long as the temperature of a material does not exceed Curie's temperature. Felicia's dear molecule of Ferromagnetism can occur in materials with atoms that have magnetic moments of atoms in random directions for each other. Magnetic moments become orderly and parallel to the outer magnetic field. Once the outer magnetic field is removed, the magnetic moment in the atoms of matter will eliminate each other so it forms a tiny magnetic moment. Feromagnetism has two similar magnetic poles associated with an electron spin that does not mate. This magnetic pole has a uniformity of direction with magnetic poles around it in a group of very small sizes. This group is called domains. The domains in feromagnetism have random directions for each other. Permanent magnets form through submission to existing domains. The feromagnetism rate is determined by the regularity of the electron spin-spin. Strong magnetism is obtained from spin-spins with long order, while magnetism disappears when the spin-spin is completely random. Feromagnetism can reach the magnetic stage at zero at Curie's temperature. This stage appears after feromagnetism has been through maximum magnetization.

Scientists who work in acutes are acute while someone who works in the field of acute technology can be called an acoustic engineer. Acoustic implementation is present in almost every aspect of modern society with the most obvious is the audio and noise control industry. Hearing is one of the most important ways to survive in the animal world and saying is one of the most typical characteristics of human development and culture. Thus, acute science spread to many facets of human society of music, medicine, architecture, industrial production, warfare, and many more. Similarly, species of animals such as songbirds and frogs use sound and hearing as key elements in mating rituals or mark territories. Arts, crafts, science, and technology have provoked one another to advance one another entirely, as in many other fields of knowledge. \"Wheel of Acoustics\" by Robert Bruce Lindsay is a well-received general of various fields in acutes. The word \"acoustic\" is derived from the Greek word \"from,\" which means \"from or to hear, ready to hear\" and from the E.T. (Acoustos), \"hear, hear,\" which is derived from the verb \u25aaO way (akouo), \"I hear.\" The Latin synonym is \"sonic\", after which the term sonic is used to be a synonym for acoustics and then it's a acoustic branch. The frequency above and below sound range is called \"ultrasonic\" and \"infrasonic\". In the 6th century B.C.E., the ancient Greek philosopher Pythagoras wanted to know why some combinations of music sounds more beautiful than others, and he found the answer in terms of the numeric ratio that represented a series of harmonious tones on a string.",

For example, a string of certain lengths will sound very harmonious to the string twice its length (another factor is considered equal). In modern language, if the string rings a C when it is plucked, the string that is twice the length will ring C with one lower octave. In one music - making system, the notes are given by 16:9 for D, 8:5 for E, 3:2, for F, 4:3 for G, 6:5 for A, and 16:15 for B, in a rising order. Aristotle (384-322 B.C.E.) understood that sound consists of compression and smoothing air that \"falls and hits the air next to it...\", an excellent description of the nature of the wave movement. On Things Heard, generally thought to be from Strato of Lampsacus, states that the height of the tone is related to the frequency of vibrations and the speed of sound. In some 20 B.C.E., Roman architects and engineers Vitruvius wrote a tract about theater's acoustic properties including discussions about interference, echoages, and the introduction of the case of the case. In the book V De architecura (Ten Book Architecture), Vitruvius describes sound as a wave comparable to an extended wave of water to three dimensions, which, when disturbed by barriers, will flow back and break the waves that follow it. He described the climbing chairs in ancient theaters designed to prevent noise damage like this and also recommend bronze vessels of appropriate size placed in theaters to resonate in a fourth, fifth, and so on, to double octaves, in order to synchronize with a more desired tone of harmony.",

Especially Galileo Galilei (1564 JUNI1642) as well as Marin Mercenne (1588 JULI1648), separately found a complete law of vibrations (completely what Pythagoras and his followers had begun 2,000 years earlier). Galileo wrote: \"The waves are produced by the vibrations of a loud object, which spread through the air, bringing a stimuli to the ear timpani that is interpreted by the mind as sound\", an extraordinary statement that points at the beginning of physiological and acute psychology. The experimental speed of sound in the air was successfully made between 1630 and 1680 by a number of researchers, especially mersenne. Meanwhile, Newton (1642 JULY1727) lowered the wave - speed relationship in solid matter, which is a physical acuity platform (Principia, 1687). The substantial progress in acuteness rests on the more powerful concepts of mathematics and physics, made during the eighteenth century by Euler (1707 During this era, continuum physics, or field theory, began to accept a definite mathematical structure. Wave equations appear in a number of contexts, including an airborne sound bridge. In the nineteenth century, the main figures of acute mathematics were Helmholtz in Germany, which consolidated the physiological acoustic field, and Lord Rayleigh in England, who combined his previous knowledge with his own contributions to this field in his monumental work Theory of Sound (1877). Also in the 19th century, Wheatstone, Ohm, and Henry developed an analogy between electricity and acuteity.

Acoustic archaeological theories are focused around ritualistic purposes and on the ecolocation of caves. In archaeology, acoustic sounds and rituals correlate directly because certain sounds are intended to bring participants closer to spiritual awakening.

Potassium in nature is found only in ionic salt.

The neutral potassium atom has 19 electrons, one more than the very stable configuration of the noble argon gas. Therefore and its first ionic energy as low as 418.8 kJ/mol, potassium atoms are more likely to lose the last electron so it's positive than getting one electron to get a negative charge (though the alkalyda ions are charged negatively instead of impossible). This process requires very little energy so that potassium is easily oxidized by atmospheric oxygen. On the contrary, the second ionization energy is very high (3052 kJ/mol), since the release of two electrons violates the electron configuration of a stable noble gas electron (argon inert). Hence, potassium is not easy to form compounds with a +2 or higher oxidation state. Potassium is a highly active metal that reacts greatly with oxygen in the water and in the air. Potassium reacts with oxygen forming potassium peroxide, and with water forms potassium hydroxide. Potassium reaction to water is dangerous because of its intense exothermal properties and production of its hydrogen gas. Hydrogen reacts again with oxygen in the atmosphere, producing water, which reacts with the remaining potassium. This reaction only requires a drop of water; therefore, potassium and sodium-potassium \u0567 NaK liquid is a strong hissing that can be used to dry the solvent before distillation.

In a human body the mass of 70 kilograms, about 4,400 cores of 40K collapse every second. Natural potassium activity is 31 Bq/g. Potassium is formed in a supernova through the nucleosinthesis of a lighter atom. Potassium is essentially made on supernova Type II through an explosive oxygen burning process. 40K is also formed in the nucleosinthesis of the s process and the neon en burning process. Potassium forms about 2.6% of the earth's crust weight and is the seventh most abundant element in the earth's crust. It's the 17th most abundant element on earth, and the 20th most abundant element in the solar system. The concentration of potassium in seawater is 0.39 g/L (0.039% b/v), roughly one over twenty-seven of sodium concentration. The main content of the potas is a mixture of potassium salt because plants have little or no sodium content, and the other mineral content consists of calcium salts with relatively low water solvents. Although potassium has been used since ancient times, its history is largely understood as a substance that is fundamentally different from sodium mineral salts. Georg Ernst Stahl obtained experimental evidence that led him to suggest a fundamental difference in sodium and potassium salt in 1702, and Henri Louis Duhamel du Monceau was able to prove this difference in 1736. The exact chemical composition of potassium and sodium compounds, as well as the status of potassium and sodium chemicals, is unknown, so Antoine Lavoisier did not include alkalis in the list of chemical elements in 1789. In a long time, the only important potassium applications are the production of glass, bleach, soap and gunpowder as potassium nitrate.",

Justus Liebig in 1840 discovered that potassium was an important element for plants and that most types of low - potassium soil caused the demand for potassium salt to increase sharply. The wood ash from the pine tree was originally used as a source of potassium salt for fertilizer, but, with mineral deposits containing potassium chloride near Sta-furt en], Germany in 1868, the production of potassium fertilizers of industrial proportions began. Other potas deposits were also found, and in the 1960s Canada became the dominant producer. Potassium metal was first isolated in 1807 in England by Sir Humphry Davy, who isolated it from the caustic potas (KOH, potassium hydroxide) with KOH electrolysisizing it with a pile of volta, newly discovered technology. Potassium was the first metal to be isolated with electrolysis. Then in the same year, Davy reported the extract of sodium metals from the derivative minerals (soda fire, NaOH, or lindi) and not from plant salt, with similar techniques, indicating that the elements, as well as the salt, are different. Although the production of potassium and sodium metals should have shown that both are elements, it took some time before this view was accepted universally. Potassium is not found in nature because of its high reactivity. He reacts greatly with water (see the prevention section below) and also reacts with oxygen. Ortolas (feldspar potassium) is a normal rock formation mineral. The Granite, for example, contains 5% potassium, which is far above average within the Earth's crust.

Potassium is the eighth or ninth most common element in the human body by mass (0.2%), so 60 kilograms of adults contain a total of about 120 g potassiums. The body has about as much potassium as sulfur and chlorine, and only calcium and phosphorus are more (except the CHON en) that are everywhere). Potassium Ion is present in a variety of proteins and enzymes. Potassium levels affect multiple physiological processes, including the homeostasis of potassium indicate the maintenance of the body's total potassium content, the levels of plasma potassium, and the concentration ratio of extracellular potassium against intracellular within narrow limits, in the face of fluctuation (food), kidney excretion, and shift between intracellular and extracellular compartments. The plasma potassium is usually maintained at 3.5 to 5.0 millimol (mmols) or milliquarents (mEq) per liter by various mechanisms. The situation outside this range is linked to many causes of rising mortality, and some heart disease, kidney disease, and lung disease develop faster if the serum's potassium levels are not preserved within normal range. The average food gives the body 40 to 50 potassium, more than all the plasma. However, these surges cause only potassium plasma to increase 10% at most as a result of rapid and efficient cleaning through renal and extra renal mechanisms.

The potassium content in the plasma is strictly controlled by four basic mechanisms, which have names and classifications. All four are 1) negative feedback system reactive, 2) reactive forward bait system, 3) predictive or circian systems, and 4) internal transport systems or cell membranes. Collectively, the first three are sometimes called external homeostasis system potassium; and the first two are called \"homeostasis potassium reactive system.\" The handling of potassium by the kidneys is closely related to the treatment of sodium. Potassium is the main ion (positive ion) in the mmol/L animal cell, (4.8 g)), while sodium is the main caation of extracellular/L fluid, (3,345 g)]. Inside the kidney, about 80 gallons [80 L] of plasma a day is filtered through glomerulus and into the kidney tubule en]. This filter involves about 600 g sodium and 33 g potassium. Since only 1 JULI10 g sodium and 1 JUNI g potassium tend to be replaced through food, kidney filtering must efficiently absorb what remains of plasma. Sodium direabsorpsy to maintain extracellular volumes, osmotic pressure, and sodium concentration serum within narrow bounds; potassium direabsortpsy to maintain the concentration of potassium serum within narrow bounds. The sodium en pump inside the kidney tubule operates to reabsorbed the sodium. Potassium should be maintained as well, but, since the number of potassiums in the blood plasma is very small and the cluster of potassiums in the cells is about thirty times greater, the situation is not so critical for potassium. Because potassium is being moved passively by the opposite direction of sodium as a response to real Donnan integrity (but it's not actual), potassium can't be below potassium in the serum unless sometimes through the secretion of water actively at the end of processing.",

At the end of processing, potassium is secreted one more time if the serum levels are too high. Without intake, potassium is excreted about 200 milligrams per day until, within about a week, potassium in the serum decreases to a light deficiency rate 3,0103.5 mmol/L. If there is still no intake, the concentration continues to decline until severe deficiencies lead to death. Potassium moves passively through the pores of cell membranes. When an ion moves through the pump, there is a gate on the pump on either side of the cell membrane and only one gate can be opened at once. As a result, about 100 ions per second are forced through them. The pores only have one gate, and there's only one type of ion that can flow through it, at 10 million to 100 million ions per second. Pores require calcium to open although it is estimated that calcium works upside down by blocking at least one pore. The carbonyl cluster inside the pores of amino acid mimics the water hydration that occurs in the solution of water through the properties of electrostatic charge on four clusters of carbonil inside the pores. Potassium can be detected based on taste because it triggers three of the five kinds of sensations, according to its concentration. The diluted potassium ions taste sweet, allowing the concentration of being in milk and juice, while the higher concentration becomes more bitter, and eventually the taste is salty. The combined bitter and salty flavor of the high potassium solution makes high doses of potassium supplementation through liquid drinks a challenge in flavoring.

The mineral industry refers to potassium chloride both as the potas and as the muriate of potash, short for MOP. Pure potassium metal can be isolated with hydroxide electrolysis in a process that has changed slightly since the first time used by Humphry Davy in 1807. Although electrolysis processes were developed and used on an industrial scale in the 1920s, thermal methods by evaluating sodium with potassium chloride in a chemical balance reaction became the dominant method in the 1950s. The production of sodium potassium alloy is done by changing the time of the reaction and the amount of sodium used in the reaction. Griesheimer's use of potassium fluoride reactions with calcium carbide is also used to produce potassium.

Other chemists throughout Europe soon began studying platinum, including Andreas Sigmund Marggraph, Torbern Bergman, J\u00f6ns Jakob Berzelius, William Lewis, and Pierre Macquer. In 1752, Henrik Scheffer published a detailed scientific description of this metal, which he referred to as \"white gold\", including a study of his success in melting platinum ore with the aid of the arsen. Scheffer explains platinum as a metal that is more difficult to cut than gold, but it has the same resilience to corrosion. Carl von sickingen studied platinum more deeply in 1772. He managed to make platinum limber by combining it with gold, dissolving the aloy with aqua regia, settling platinum with ammonium chloride, turning on ammonium chloroplatinate, and hammering separate platinums to bring it together. Franz Karl Achard made the first platinum crew in 1784. He used platinum by fused it with arsen, then vaporized the arsen. Since other Platine family members had not yet been found (platina was the first), Scheffer and sickingen made mistaken assumptions about the violence of the Platina pure iron being a relatively hard, even fragile substance, when its flexibility and elasticity approached gold.",

The combination of this impure platinum residue, called \"plyoksen,\" with gold was the only way at that time to get this soft compound, but now, the platinum level of high purity has been available and a very long cable can be made from pure platinum, very easy because its crystal structure is the same as most other soft metals. In 1786, Charles III of Spain provided Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois Chabaneau with a library and laboratory to help with his research on platinum. Chabaneau managed to remove some impurity from ore, including gold, mercury, lead, copper, and iron. This led him to believe that he was working with a single metal, but in reality the ore still had an unknown platinum-type metal. This led to inconsistent trials. At one point, platinum seemed soft, but when coupled with iridium, it became very fragile. Sometimes the metal can't burn, but when combined with osmium, it evaporates. After a few months, Chabaneau successfully produced 23 kg (50.71 pounds) of pure, soft platinum by hammering and pressing the sponge when it was white to burn. Chabeneau realized platinum would be valuable in the making of various objects, so he immediately started a business with Joaquin Cabezas to produce platinum ingots and platinum utensils. This is the beginning of the platinum age in Spain. In 2007, Gerhard Ertl won the Nobel Chemical for the determination of the molecular oxidation mechanism carbon monoxide using platinum (as a catholic modifier).

If a pure platinum is found in placer deposits or other ore, it can be isolated from them by various methods of impurity reduction. Since platinum is significantly denser than many impurities, a lighter impurity can be eliminated by simply floating away in fluid. Platina is magnetic, while nickel and iron are both feromagnetic. These impurities are then eliminated by the flow of electromagnets above the mix. Since platinum has a melting point higher than most other substances, many impurities can be burned or melted without melting platinum. Finally, platinum is resistant to hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid, while other substances are vulnerable to these two acids. Metal impurity can be removed by stirring a mixture in one of these two acids, and restoring the platinum that was left behind. One method that is easy for rough platinum purifying, which contains platinum, gold, and other platinum - class metals, is to process it using aqua regia, which can dissolve palladium, gold and platinum, while osmium, iridium, rhodium and rhodium do not react. Gold is kept in addition to iron chloride and after gold is separated by filtering, platinum is stored as a chloroplatinate ammonium with an addition to ammonium chloride. Ammonium chloroplates can be converted into platinum with warming. Unmistakable hexlooplatinates can be reduced with tin elements, and platinums are obtained with the same methods performed in the recovery of platinum residue on a laboratory scale. Of the 224 tons of platinum sold in 2013, 101 tons were used for vehicle emissions control equipment (45%), 66.3 tons for jewelry (30%), 19.4 tons for the production of chemicals and oil processing (8.7%), and 5.88 tons for electronic applications such as hard disk drives (2.6%).",

This element has been used as a catalyst since the early 19th century, when platinum dust was used to catalyze hydrogen ignition. The most important application is in automotives as catalytic converts (catalytic converter), which allows complete burn of unburned hydrocarbons concentrated low from exhaust to carbon dioxide and water vapor. Platina is also used in the oil industry as a catalyst in a number of splitting processes, but especially in the form of dialysis (catalytic reforming) nafta chain into a higher octana-based gasoline that becomes rich in aromatic compounds. PtO2, also known as the Adams catalyst, is used as a hydrogenation catalyst, especially for vegetable oil. Platina also catalyses the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen and is used in fuel cells as catalysts to reduce oxygen. From 1889 to 1960, the meter is defined as the length of the platinum-iridium alloy metal rod (90:10), known as the International Prototype Metre. The previous trunk was made from platinum in 1799. The International Prototype Kilogram remains defined by a platinum-iridium alloy tube made in 1879. Standard hydrogen electrode also uses platinum-plated platinum electrodes given its resistance to corrosion and other properties. Platina is a valuable metal commodity; it has an ISO XPT currency code. Coins, bars, and ingots were traded or collected.

Watchmakers appreciate platinum's unique properties, as neither easily tarnished nor aus (called last relative to gold). The price of platinum, like any industrial commodity, is more volatile than gold. In 2008, platinum prices went from $2.252 to $774 per oz, almost 2\u20443 in loss of value. Instead, the price of gold fell from ~$1,000,000 to ~$700/oz at the same period, only losing 1\u20443 of its value. During a stable and sustainable period of economic growth, platinum prices tend to be twice the price of gold, while during an uncertain economic period, platinum prices tend to drop due to a decrease in industrial demand, falling under the price of gold. Gold prices are more stable in slow economic periods, since gold is considered a safe haven. Although gold was used in industrial applications, his demand was not particularly affected by industrial use, in the 18th century, platinum scarcity made King Louis XV of France decree that platinum was the only metal suitable for the king. In the lab, platinum wire is used as electrodes, platinum dishes and buffers are used in thermogravimetry analysis due to strict requirements for chemical ininertity in high temperature warming (~1000 \u00b0C).

The second part, \"The Way of Knowledge,\" is held only 42 verses. Parmenides was born in 540 B.C.E. and died in 470 B.C.E. He was from the South Italian city of Elea. He came from a wealthy and honorable family in Elea. Parmenides also compiled a constitution for Elea. He was a student of Xenophanes, but didn't follow his teacher's point of view. The effect of Xenophanes on Parmenides was only in the use of poetry in conveying his philosophy. In addition, she was greatly influenced by Ameinias, a Mazhab Pythagorean. According to Plato's testimony, Parmenides visited Socrates in Athens with his student Zeno. By then Socrates was still young and Parmenides was 65 years old. The main point of \"The Way of Truth\" is the belief that \"only there is\" exists. Parmenides doesn't define what \"existing\" means, but mentions its properties. According to Parmenides, \"that which is\" is encompassing everything, untended, unchanging, and indestructible. Moreover, the \"existing one\" is also unshakable and undisputable. According to Parmenides, \"what exists\" is an undeniable truth. If anyone denies it, it will fall to contradictions.",

        "paragraph": "That can be explained by the supposition given by Parmenides. First, people can say that \"who exists\" doesn't exist. Second, people can say that \"that exist\" and \"that does not exist\" together exist. These two assumptions are impossible. The first supposition is impossible, because \"that doesn't exist\" can't be thought about and can't be talked about. \"Which doesn't exist\" can't be thought out and talked about. Second supposition is a view of Herakleitos. This would also be impossible, for the second would have received the first supposition, that \"that which does not exist\" would have been impossible. Thus, the conclusion is that \"that which does not exist\" does not exist, so only \"that which is\" can be said to exist. To better understand Parmenides ' thinking, the following example can be used. For example, someone declared \"God does not exist!\" Here, the God whose existence the person rejects actually exists, means to be accepted as \"the one who exists.\" It's because if that person says \"God does not exist,\" then that person has already thought about the concept of God. Then after that, the concept of God that the man thought was self-involved by saying \"God does not exist.\" Thus, God as the man thinks is \"there\" even if only in his own mind. As for the denial of the truth, it is likely that something is real. Because \"that which is\" is always said and thought, actually Parmenides likens \"that which is\" to thought or common sense. After arguing about \"what exists\" as truth, Parmenides also expressed consequences: Parmenides' thinking opened a new chapter in the history of Greek philosophy. It could be said that he was the inventor of metaphysics, the branch of philosophy investigating the \"existing one.\"",

Chemicals include such topics as atomic properties, the way atoms form chemical bonds to produce chemical compounds, the interaction of substances through intermolecular forces that produce the common properties of matter, and the interaction between substances through chemical reactions to form different substances. Chemistry is sometimes referred to as central science because it bridges the sciences of nature, including physics, geology, and biology. Experts differ in their opinion about etymology of the word chemistry. The history of chemistry can be traced back to alchemy, which has been practiced for several millennia in various parts of the world. The chemical word comes from alchemy, as it is called for a series of practices in ancient times that include elements of chemistry, metallurgy, philosophy, astrology, mysticism, and medicine. Alchemicals were often thought to be associated with trying to turn lead or other common raw materials into gold, but in ancient times this science studied many of the subjects of modern chemistry. Alchemy is defined by the early Greek-Egyptist alchemy of the 4th century C.E., Zosimos, as a science that studies the composition of water, movement, growth, existence, disappearance, dissipating spirit from body, and binding spirit in body. The word alchemy comes from the word Arabic al-k-k-m-\u0101. The word al-k-c-m-\u0101 is passed down from the Greek word Al-c-c-m\u0101 may have come from ancient Egypt because the word al-k-k-k-hm\u0101 may have been derived from the Greek word t-c-c-cemia, which is also derived from the word Kemi or Kimi, which is the ancient Egyptian name. Probably also, the word al-k-k-m-\u0101 is passed down from the word \u25aa- (kemiah), which means \"dit money together\" (to print). Chemicals are often referred to as \"center sciences\" because they connect other sciences, such as physics, matter science, nanotechnology, biology, pharmaceuticals, medicine, bioinformatics, and geology.",

        "paragraph": "These connections arise through various subdisciplinarys that exploit the concepts of various disciplines. For example, physical chemistry involves applying the principles of physics to matter at the atomic and molecular level. Chemicals deal with material interactions that can involve two substances or between matter and energy, especially in relation to the first laws of thermodynamics. Traditional chemistry involves interaction between chemicals in chemical reactions, which converts one or more substances into another or more substances. Sometimes this reaction is driven by analpi consideration, such as when two high-entaled substances such as hydrogen and oxygen elemental reactions form water, substances with lower entrails. Chemical reactions can be facilitated with a catalyst, which is generally another chemical involved in the reaction media but not consumed (example sulfate acid catalyzed by water electrolysis) or immunic phenomena (like electromagnetic radiation in photochemical reactions). Traditional chemistry also deals with chemical analysis, both inside and outside of a reaction, as in spectroscopy. All normal matter consists of atoms or subatomic components that make up atoms; protons, electrons, and neutrons. Atoms can combine to produce more complex forms of matter such as ions, molecules, or crystals. The structure of the world that we live in everyday and the nature of matter that interacts with us is determined by the properties of chemicals and interactions between them. Steel is harder than iron because its atoms are bound in a more rigid crystal structure. Wood burns or gets oxidation quickly because it can react spontaneously with oxygen at a chemical reaction if it is above a certain temperature. Matters tend to be classified based on their energy, phases, or chemical composition. Matter can be classified in 4 phases, the sequence of which has the lowest energy is solid, liquid, gas, and plasma.",

        "paragraph": "Of these four phases, plasma phases can be found only in the space of the star, due to its enormous energy needs. Solid matter has a fixed structure at room temperature that can resist gravity or any other weak force that tries to change it. Liquid matter has a limited bond, no structure, and will flow along gravity. Gas has no bond and acts as a free particle. Meanwhile, plasma consists only of free-moving ions; excess energy supply prevents these ions from uniting into particle elements. One way to distinguish the first three phases is with volumes and shapes: roughness, solid matter has fixed volumes and shapes, liquids have fixed volumes but no fixed shapes, while gas has neither volume nor fixed shape. Water (H2O) is liquid in room temperature because its molecules are bound by intermolecular forces called hydrogen bonds. On the other hand, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a gas at room temperature and standard pressure, since its molecules are bound to dwikub interactions that are weaker. The hydrogen bond on the water has enough energy to sustain water molecules from each other, but not to flow, which makes it fluid in the temperature between 0 \u00b0C to 100 \u00b0C on the sea level. Lowering temperatures or further energy allows organizations to form more closely, produce a solid, and release energy. The increase in energy will melt the ice even if the temperature won't change until all the ice is liquid. The increase in water temperature in turn will cause it to boil (see evaporation heat) when there is enough energy to overcome the force of intermolecular attraction and then allow molecules to move away from each other.",

The chemistry taught in high school is often called \"communicative chemistry\" and is intended as an introduction to many basic concepts and to give students tools to proceed to the next subject. Many concepts presented at this level are often considered incomplete and inaccurate technically. Nevertheless, it is a remarkable tool. Chemists regularly use these simple, elegant tools and explanations in their work, as they have proved to be able to accurately create a vastly varied model of chemical reactivity. Chemistry has historically been a new development, but it is rooted in alchemy that has been practiced for centuries around the world. The roots of chemistry can be traced to a burning phenomenon. Fire is a mystical force that transforms matter into another substance and therefore is mankind's main concern. It's the fire that leads man to the discovery of iron and glass. Once gold is discovered and becomes precious metals, many are interested in finding a method that can turn other substances into gold. This creates a protoscience called Alchemy. Alchemy is practiced by many cultures throughout history and often includes a mixture of philosophy, mysticism, and protoscience. Alchemists have discovered many chemical processes that lead to modern chemical development. As history goes on, prominent alchemists (especially Abu Musa Jabir bin Hayyan and Paracelsus) developed alchemy away from philosophy and mysticism and developed a more systematic and scientific approach. The first alchemist to apply the scientific method of alchemy and distinguishing chemistry and alchemy was Robert Boyle (1627\u25aa1691). Boyle was particularly thought to be the father of chemistry because of his most important work, the classic chemistry text The Skepticist who made the difference between an alchemical claim and the empirical scientific discovery of new chemistry.",

However, before the work, many important discoveries had been made, especially those related to the \"air\" properties that were discovered were made up of many different gases. Scottish chemist Joseph Black and J.B. van Helmont of the Netherlands discovered carbon dioxide, or what was called Black's constant air in 1754; Henry Cavendish discovered hydrogen and explained its properties and Joseph Priestley and, independently, Carl Wilhelm Scheele who isolated pure oxygen. The discovery of chemical elements has a long history that reached its peak with the invention of the periodic table of chemical elements by Dmitri Mendeleyev in 1869. British scientist John Dalton proposed the theory of modern atoms; that all matter is composed of matter atoms and that different atoms have different atomic weights as well. The development of electrochemical theory occurred early in the 19th century as the work of two scientists in particular, J.J. Berzelius and Humphry Davy, made possible by the discovery of the previous volta stacks by Alessandro Volta. Davy discovered nine new elements including alkali metals by extracting them from their oxide using electrical currents.

By 2004, global top 50 chemical producers had a sale of US$587 billion with 8.1% profit margins and 2.1% research and development spending of total sales. The year 2011 was declared by the United Nations as the International Chemical Year.

Atom is also the smallest unit that can be described from an element and still maintain its nature, formed from a tightly charged, positive nucleus surrounded by an electron system. In neutral atoms, negatively charged electrons compensate for positive charges on protons. The nucleus is very dense; the nucleus mass is 1,836 times from the electron, but the atomic fingers are about 10,000 times from the core. The atom is also the smallest entity that can be considered to maintain the chemical properties of elements, such as electronegivity, ionization energy, oxidation state, and a type of bond that is preferred to be formed (for example, metal, ionic, covalent). Elements are a bunch of atoms that have the same number of protons at its core. This number is referred to as the atomic number of elements. For example, all atoms that have 6 protons at their core are atoms of carbon chemical elements, and all atoms that have 92 protons at their core are atomic elements of uranium. The standard presentation of chemical elements is in the periodic table, which sequences elements based on atomic numbers. The periodic table is set in groups, or columns, and periods, or rows.

The molecule is the smallest part and is not divided from a pure chemical compound that still retains unique chemical and physical properties. A molecule consists of two or more atoms bound to each other. Molecular molecules are usually a set of atoms that are bound together by covalent bonds, so the structure is electrically neutral and all valence electrons pair with other electrons either in bonds or in a pair of free electrons. Thus, molecules present as electrically neutral units, unlike ions. When this rule is broken, it provides a payload for \"molecules,\" sometimes it is named as molecular ions or polyatomic ions. However, discrete properties and separation from molecular concepts usually require that molecular ions be present only in well-separated forms, such as rays directed in vacuum spaces in mass spectrometers. A collection of charged polyatomics in solids (e.g., sulfate ions or similar nitrates) is not generally considered \"moleculated\" in chemistry. Some molecules contain one or more electrons that don't pair up, creating radicals. Most relatively reactive radicals, but some of them, such as nitrogen monoxide (NO) can be stable.

Examples of this type of substance are like mineral salt (such as kitchen salt), solids such as carbon and diamonds, metals, and silica and silica and silicate minerals such as quartz and granite. One of the main characteristics of the molecule is its geometry known as the structure. While the molecular structure of diatomic atoms, triatomic or atomic tetra may not be too significant, (linear, corner pyramid, and so on) the polyatomic molecular structure, which is more than six atoms (of some elements) can be essential to chemistry in nature. A chemical substance can be an element, a compound, or a mixture of compounds, elements, or compounds and elements.

The example of the state of the phase we know is solids, liquids, and gases. Other phases include plasma, Bose-Einstein condensation, and Fermion condensation. The state of phases of magnetic material are magnetic, feromagnetic and magnetic. Physical traits, such as density and bias index tend to fit into the characteristics of phase values. The phase of matter is defined by phase transitions, which is when the energy that is inserted or expelled from the system is used to reorganize the structure of the system, instead of changing the state of the field. Sometimes the difference between phases can go on and on rather than having discriminating boundaries, in this case matter is considered supercritical. When three states meet based on certain conditions, the state is known as a tripel point and because it is an invariant, it's an easy way to determine a set of conditions. Examples of many known phases include solid, liquid and gas. Many substances indicate some solid phases. For example, there are three phases of iron solids (alpha, gamma, and delta) that vary according to temperature and pressure. The main difference between these solid phases is the crystal structure, or the structure, of the atoms.

In many simple compounds, valence bonds and concepts of oxidation can be used to predict molecular structure and structure. Similarly, the theories of classical physics can be used to predict many of the ionic structures. At more complex compounds, like metal complexes, valence bonds theory cannot be used because it requires a deeper understanding of quantum mechanics bases. A chemical bond can be a covalent bond, an ionic bond, a hydrogen bond or just because of the style of Van der Waals. Each kind of bond is considered to be a number of potential. This potential creates interactions that hold atoms together in molecules or crystals. In many simple compounds, valence bonds theory, the Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion, and concept of oxidation can be used to explain molecular structure and composition. The ionic bond forms when the metal loses one or more electrons, becomes a positive charged caation, and the electrons are then drawn by non-logam atoms, becoming a negatively charged anion. The two countercharged ions draw each other, and the ion bond is the electrostatic force of the pull between the two. For example, sodium, metal, is losing one electron to be kation Na+ while chlor (Cl), non-logam, accepts this electron to be a Cl-. Ion-ion will be bound together by electrostatic attraction, as well as sodium chloride compounds, or regular kitchen salts, formed.

With more complex compounds, such as metal complexes, valence bonds are less valid and alternative approaches, such as molecular orbital theories, are commonly used. In the chemical context, energy is an attribute of a substance as a consequence of atomic structure, molecules or aggregates. Because chemical changes are accompanied by changes in one or more of these structures, always accompanied by an increase or a decrease in energy from the substance involved. Some energy is moved between the environment and the reactant reaction in the form of heat or light; thus the product of a reaction can have more or less energy than the reactant. A reaction is said to be exergonic if the energy at the end is lower than the initial state; in case the endergonic reaction is reversed. A reaction is said to be exothermic if the reaction releases heat into the environment; in the case of endothermic reactions, the heat absorbs from the environment. Chemical reactions are always impossible unless the reactor transcends the energy barrier known as activation energy. The speed of a chemical reaction (at T- given temperature) is associated with E's activation energy, by the population factor Boltzmann E/k{\\displaystyle e^{-E/kT} the probability of a molecule having greater energy than or equal E at the temperature given T.

Thus, as vibration and rotation levels are closer to electronic energy levels, heat is easier to transfer between matter relative to light or other forms of electronic energy. For example, ultraviolet electromagnetic radiation is not transferred better than one substance to another than thermal or electrical energy. The existence of a typical energy level for different chemicals is useful for identifying them with spectrum lines analysis. Various types of spectrum are often used in chemical spectroscopy, such as IR, microwaves, NMR, ESR, and so on. Spectroscopy is also used to identify the composition of objects as long-range as stars and distant galaxies by analyzing their radiation spectrum. chemical energy terms are sometimes used to show the potential of a chemical to transform through chemical reactions or to alter other chemicals.

Many intermediate reactions vary in stability so that they can be described during reaction. Reaction mechanisms are raised to explain kinetics and the mixture of a relative product of a reaction.

An ion is a charged species, an atom or a molecule, that has lost or acquired one or more electrons. When an atom loses one electron and therefore has more protons than electrons, it's a positive-charged ion or kation. When atoms acquire electrons and therefore have more electrons than protons, atoms are negatively charged ions or anions.

The simplest theory is the theory of Arrhenius, which states that acid is a substance that produces hydronium ions when dissolved in water, and bases are what produce hydroxide ions when dissolved in water. According to Br\u00f8nsted\u25aaLowry theory, acid is a substance that donates positive hydrogen ions to other substances in chemical reactions; with that statement, the base is the substance that accepts the hydrogen ions. The third acid-base theory is Lewis' theory, which is based on the formation of new chemical bonds. Lewis' theory explains that acid is a substance capable of accepting a pair of electrons from other substances during the formative process of bonding, whereas bases are substances that can provide a pair of electrons to form new bonds. According to this theory, the important things that are exchanged are the cargoes. There are several other ways in which a substance can be classified as acid or base, as proved in the history of this concept. The power of acid is usually measured by two methods. One measurement, based on the definition of acidity of Arrhenius, is pH, which is a measurement of the concentration of hydronium ions in the solution, as expressed on the negative scale of the logarithm. Thus, the solution that has a low pH has a high concentration of hydronium ions and is said to be more acidic. Another measurement, based on Br\u00f8nsted\u25aaLowry definition, is the constant acid dissociative (Ka), which measures the relative ability of a substance to act as acid under the definition of Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry acid. That is, the substance with the higher Ka is more likely to donate hydrogen ions in a chemical reaction than with the lower Ka.

Reductor transfers electrons to other substances and therefore oxidizes themselves. And, since it's \"distributing\" electrons, it's also called electron donors. The oxidation and reduction precisely refers to the change in the number oxidation of the electron that may never have occurred. So oxidation is better defined as an increase in oxidation, and reduction as a decrease in oxidation numbers. Although the concept of uncertainty is widely used in various fields of science, in the context of chemistry, it appears every time a number of different circumstances of chemical composition are made possible, for example, in a mixture of some chemical compounds that can react to each other, or when a substance can be present in more than one kind of phase. A chemical system in balance, although it has a never-changing composition, is least static; the substance molecules continue to react to each other, resulting in dynamic balance. Thus the concept describes the state when parameters like chemical composition remain unchanged over time. Quantum chemistry mathematically explains the basic behavior of matter at the molecular level. In principle, it is possible to explain all chemical systems using this theory. In practice, only the simplest chemical system can be realistically investigated with pure quantum mechanics and must be done almost for most practical purposes (for example, Hartree-Fock, post-Hartree-Fock, or the theory of fragility function, see chemical computing for details).

In some Christian genres, only the implementation and order of things differ in the same core and purpose. For Orthodox Christians, fasting is a vital form of spiritual discipline, since it is often mentioned in the Old Testament and the New Testament and has a close connection with Orthodox Christian theology of synergy (Greek: Soma) and the soul (Greek: Pneuma). Moreover, for Orthodox Christians, fasting is not intended to suffer, but it is intended to keep away from all forms of greed, greed, greed, and thought, speech, and bad deeds. It is not lawful for you to fast a fast, except by the permission of Allah.

Obstacles are expected to be done every Friday of the year, unless Fridays coincide with ecclesiastical holidays.

It's defined as the soluted ion activity of the hydrogen ion (H+). The coefficient of hydrogen ion activity cannot be measured experimentally, so its value is based on theoretical calculations. The pH scale is not an absolute scale. It's relative to a set of standard solution that the pH is defined by international agreements. The concept of pH was first introduced by Danish chemist S\u00f8ren Peder Lauritz S\u00f8rensen in 1909. It is not known exactly what the abbreviation \"p\" means to \"pH\" is. Some references indicate that p is derived from the abbreviation for power, others refer to the German word Potenz (which also means rank), and others refer to the term potential. Jens Norby published a scientific work in 2000 that argued that p was a fixed meaning \"negative logic.\" Pure water is neutral, with its pH at 25 \u00b0C temperatures set to 7.0. The reduction with pH is less than seven called acidic, and the solution with pH is more than seven is said to be base or alkali. The measurements of pH are essential in areas associated with life or chemical processing industries such as chemistry, biology, medicine, agriculture, food science, engineering, and oceanography. Of course, other fields of science and technology are also used even in lower frequencies. pH defined as minus logarithm of hydrogen ion activity in water - based solution. pH is an infinite quantity.

The potential difference in the electrode of this glass ideally follows the Nernst equation: with E is a measurable potential, the standard E0 potential electrode, the R fixed gas, the T temperature in kelvin, F fixed Faraday, and n is the number of electrons being transferred. The potential of electrode E is proportional to the logartima of hydrogen ion activity. This definition is essentially not practical because hydrogen ion activity is the result of times of concentration with the coefficient of activity. The coefficient of single hydrogen ion activity cannot be calculated experimentally. To overcome it, electrodes are calibrated with a solution whose activity is known. The operational definition of pH is officially defined by the ISO 31-8 International Standard as follows: For an X solution, first measure of electromotive style EX galvani cells and then measure the different electromotive ES cell galvani styles only in X solution replacements unknown to the SH solution known as pH (standar). pH solution X is therefore the difference between pH solution X with pH standard solution depends solely on a measured two potential difference. So, pH is obtained from a potential measurement with electrodes that are calibrated to one or more standard pHs. A pH meter is set to such a read meter for a standard solution is the same as the value of pH\u25aaS). The value of pH\u25aaS) for various S standard solutions is given by the IUPAC recommendation.

A very low pH measure, for example, in highly acidic mining water, requires a special procedure. Electrode calibration in this case can be used using a standard solution of dense sulfate acid whose value is counted pH using Pitzer parameters to calculate the coefficient of activity. pH is one example of acidity function. The concentration of hydrogen ions can be measured in a non-accurial solution, but the calculation will use a different acidity function. pH superasam is usually calculated to use Hammett acidity function, H0. Most simple acid-basis indicators used are litmus paper that turns red when acidity is high and blue when acidity is low in addition to using lakmus paper, base acid indicators can be measured by pH meters that work on an electrolyte/conductivity principle. By the original definition of S\u00f8rensen, pH] is defined as minus logarithm concentration of hydrogen ions. This definition has long been abandoned and replaced with a pH definition. It's possible to measure the concentration of hydrogen ions directly when the electrodes used are calibrated according to the concentration of hydrogen ions. One way to do that is by integrating a strong acid solution whose concentration is known with a strong alkaline solution whose concentration is also known for the relatively high concentration of electrolytes in the background. Because acid concentrations and alkalis are known, it's easy to calculate hydrogen ions so that a measurable potential can be concentrated with ion concentration. This calibration is usually done using the Gran plot. This calibration will produce a potential value of standard electrodes, E0, and gradient factors, f, so the Nerst equation can be used to lower the hydrogen ion concentration of experimental E. Gradient factors are usually less than one.",

Crocodiles generally inhabit such fresh water habitats as rivers, lakes, swamps and other wetlands. Others, however, live in brackish water like a estuary. The main food crocodiles are spineless animals like the fish nation, reptiles and mammals, sometimes also preying on molluscs and crustaceans depending on their species. Crocodiles are ancient animals, which have changed little by evolution since the time of dinosaurs.

Webbed feet are also an advantage when crocodiles need to move or walk in shallow water. Crocodiles can move very quickly at short distances, even outside the water. This animal has a powerful jaw, which can bite with incredible strength, making it an animal with the greatest bite power. This crocodile's bite pressure is no less than 5,000 psi (pounds per square inch; equivalent to 315 kg/cm2); compared to the bite strength of the rottweiler dog only 335 psi, a giant white shark of 400 psi, or dubuk (hyena) some 800 \u25ef 1,000 psi. The teeth of the crocodile are pointy and sharp, useful for holding its prey. Crocodiles attack their prey by snapping and biting at their prey, and then pulling it hard and suddenly into the water. Therefore the muscles around his jaw are developing so well that it's very strong. Such open mouths are also very difficult to open, similar to the gecko's. But instead, the muscles that open the crocodile's mouth are very weak. crocodile researchers simply wrap large tape (clad) around or tie the inner rubber cord at the top of the muzzle that closes, to keep the mouth shut while being observed and measured, or when wanting to transport the animal safely.",

And he is waiting for the prey of the land or of the fish to come upon him suddenly. As cold-blooded animals, these predators can last long enough without food, and rarely really need to move to hunt their prey. Although crocodiles seem to be slow, they are peak predators in their environment, and some species have observed shark attacks and kills. The exception was the Egyptian cerek, known for its symbiotic relationship with crocodiles. It's said that this bird eats parasitic animals and scraps of meat that reside in the crocodile's mouth, and for that the river king opens his mouth wide and lets the cerek in to clean it up. In addition to eating meat, 13 of the 23 species of crocodiles are now known to eat fruit as well.

In sink crocodiles, temperatures of about 31.6 \u00b0C will produce male animals, a little lower or higher than that would produce female crocodiles. The egg flushing period is about 80 days, depending on the average temperature of the nest. Crocodiles have an instinct to return to their original residence. Three fierce crocodiles in North Australia have been transferred to their new location, 400 km away, using helicopters. But in three weeks these animals are known to have arrived back where they came from. The event was monitored by a tracking device attached to the reptile's body. According to current knowledge, crocodiles have a closer kinship with birds and dinosaurs, compared with most common reptiles. The first three groups, coupled with the pterosaurus group, were classified as a large group of Archosaurs. There's no convincing way to calculate the age of the crocodile, except by knowing the time of development, despite some techniques that have been developed. The most common method used to measure the age of this animal is to calculate a circle growing in bones and teeth. Each circle represents a change in growth rate, perhaps caused by a change in drought and repeated rain each year. By keeping in mind the chance of inconsequence of this method, the oldest crocodile is likely to be the largest species. The sink crocodile is estimated to live up to 70, with fewer individuals that can prove to be over 100 years old.",

These animals rescued Bob Irwin and Steve Irwin from the wild after being shot twice by hunters. As a result of the gunshot, the crocodile (now known as \"Mr. Freshy\") lost its right eye. Crocodile bodies vary greatly from type to type, ranging from dwarf crocodiles to giant estuaries. Large species can grow longer than 5 m and weigh more than 1,000 pounds [200 kg]. Even so, baby crocodiles are only about 20 centimeters tall when the eggs hatch. The largest species of crocodiles is the estuary, which lives in Southeast Asia to northern Australia. The biggest size of the estuary has yet to be debated. The largest crocodile ever recorded was a giant estuary of eight feet [1.6 m], which was shot by a school teacher in Australia. Whereas the largest gator alive is a 7.1 - meter - long bilge at the Bhitarkanika Wildlife Refuge, Orissa, India. In June 2006, his record was recorded on The Guinness Book of World Records. Two other reliable records of the largest crocodile size are a record of two six-and-a-half crocodiles who were shot first in the Mary River, Northern Territory, Australia in 1974 by a poacher, who was then measured by a forestry officer. The second crocodile was killed in the Fly River, Papua New Guinea. The second crocodile's size is actually derived from the skin, measured by Jerome Montague, a wildlife researcher. And since the size of the skin is always smaller than the original animal, it is believed that the second crocodile is at least 10 centimeters longer in life.",

It has a body length of up to 6 feet and weighs up to 1,114,27 kg. Another giant pet crocodile is a sink crocodile named Gomek. This animal was captured by George Craig in Papua New Guinea and then sold to St. Augustine Alligator Farm in Florida, America. This crocodile died of heart disease in February 1997 at a certain age. According to the captivity record, when Gomek died, he had a length of five and a half feet and probably between 70 and 80 years of age. Bhitarkanika's largest crocodile is estimated to have been obtained by experts by the size of a crocodile skull kept by the Kanika Royal family. The crocodile was likely shot to death near Dhamara about 1926 and then preserved his skull by the King of Kanika at that time. Long guesses above were obtained through calculations, remembering that the skull length of the crocodile was about a seventh of its total length. Most crocodiles belong to the genus Crocodylus. The other two surviving members of the Crocodylia tribe are Osteolaemus and Tomistoma, each monotymic. So far it has been known about seven species (or subspecies) of crocodiles found in Indonesia, namely: The presence of the mindoro crocodile in Indonesia (yakni in east and southeast Sulawesi) has not been reported since 1996. Kalimantan crocodiles (known from West and South Kalimantan) are still debated, since these are similar shapes and habitats to freshwater crocodiles, but with some other characteristics that distinguish them.",

And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise. The jaw teeth beneath the alligator are hidden by the upper lip when the muzzle is taped up. Gavial aka juung-julung is another type of crocodile that belongs to the Gavialidae tribe. This crocodile has a fat body, but with a long, thin muzzle, it's not nothing like a swivelhead. It is also called a fish crocodile, since its main food is fish. In addition, gavial is also almost entirely aquaatic, and only occasionally go ashore to sunbathe.

The different kinds of giant crocodiles can be very dangerous to humans. The sink crocodiles and Nile crocodiles are the most dangerous, killing hundreds of people each year in different parts of Southeast Asia and Africa. A swamp crocodile as well as perhaps an endangered black kaiman, is also extremely dangerous. American alligators are less aggressive and less likely to attack people when left alone.

Many of the rest of the soldiers were killed by crocodiles, although even the weapons of the British army no longer contributed to the death of the unfortunate army. In addition to mosquitoes, crocodiles are listed as the most common cause of death in 2001. Despite the fear of living crocodiles, the products of their skin are much liked and valuable. Crocodile skin is treated for a variety of leather items like wallets, bags, hats, belts, shoes and so on. Indonesia exported quite a lot of crocodile skin, about 15,228 pieces in 2002, with countries that exported between them to Singapore, Japan, Korea, Italy, and several other countries. Four fifths are from the skin of Irian crocodiles, and about 90% of them are produced from crocodile captivity. Crocodile meat is also eaten in such countries as Australia, Ethiopia, Thailand, South Africa, Cuba, as well as in parts of Indonesia and the United States. In view of the decline and extinction of many populations, many kinds of crocodiles in various countries are held in protective status. The four types of crocodiles in Indonesia, Crocodylus novaeguineae (Irian buaya); C. sayius; C. famiss (Siambu); and Tomistoma schlegeli (Syyulong) have been protected by law.

        "paragraph": "Vocation or evaporation is the process of the liquid transformation of molecules (example water) spontaneously becoming gas (exemplary of water vapor). This process is the opposite of condensation. Generally evaporation can be seen from the gradual loss of fluid when exposed to gases with significant volumes. Evaporation can also be interpreted as a process of diffusion of water vapor into the atmosphere from a free open water surface. Including the loss of water from lakes, rivers, even clouds and saturated soil and plant surfaces, it does not combine the loss of transspiration from plants. It's important to distinguish between the process of evaporation that only pays attention to free water bodies and those that come from evapotranspiration. The average molecule does not have enough energy to escape from the fluid. Otherwise the liquid will turn into steam quickly. When the molecules bump into each other they exchange energy in different degrees, depending on how they collide. Sometimes this energy transfer is so biased, that one molecule gains enough energy to penetrate the boiling point of fluid. If this happens near the surface of the molecular fluid can fly into the gas and \"approach.\" There's fluid that doesn't seem to evaporate at certain temperatures in certain gases. Liquids like this have molecules that tend not to transmit energy to each other in enough patterns to give one molecule \"off-speed\" - heat energy - that it takes to turn into steam. But liquids like this actually evaporate, it's just that the process is much slower and because it's more invisible the evaporation is an essential part of the water cycle. The moisture in the air will gather into clouds.",

        "paragraph": "Because of temperature, small water vapor particles can join (dendened) into droplets of water and fall rain. The water cycle goes on and on and on. Solar energy moves evaporation from oceans, lakes, dew and other water sources. In the collective hydrology of evapocraration and transspiration (which involves evapocraspiration in plant stomata) is called. Partly evaporation rate is controlled by solar radiation, which provides the energy needed to convert liquid water into water vapor, which is heat latent evaporation or 2,44 \u00d7 106J kg-1 at 25OC temperature. The net radiation proportion received by the earth available for this process depends not only on transmission, absorption, and reflection of the atmosphere and the surface of the earth, but also on the amount used for atmospheric warming and soil warming. The moisture of the air above the surface of the evaporation will eventually increase until, when the air becomes saturated, evaporation will stop unless these layers are scattered. The need for atmospheric moisture is therefore controlled not only by the balance of radiation but also by the humidity and speed of wind. The other evaporation rate is also influenced by the characteristics of the body itself, the depth, the vastness and quality of water. Understanding the pace of evaporation becomes more complicated by the need to distinguish between potential and actual evaporation. evaporation is an actual rate of observable water loss, whereas the potential rate is the evaporation that may occur in the free water body. The small size of the evaporation is influenced by water temperature factors, temperature, soil humidity, wind speed, air pressure, and sunlight. Some of the key factors that affect the immediate or indirect rate of evaporation are: The total radiation of the sun and the earth feed constantly on the water's surface and thus strongly affect long and short wave radiation coming out of / through the surface and causing water - level temperatures, which in turn regulate the evaporating process.",

        "paragraph": "Radiation balance thus determines the rate of water loss from the surface. A thin layer of air that comes in contact with and near the surface of the evaporation gains water vapor from the surface. The air flow is constantly removed from the surface by the wind, carrying new air currents that come in contact with evaporation surfaces. Additionally, existing turbulence creates a trade between a thin layer of air that comes in contact with the surface and layers that are directly above it. Thus the speed of the wind and the degree of turbulence on the evaporation surface greatly affected the pace of evaporation. The temperature of the evaporation surface and the air temperature on the lowest layer above it, which determines the immediate temperature gradient above the surface is an important factor that affects the evaporation rate of the surface, since surface temperature will determine the growth of long waves. The relative humidity or water vapor on the surface and the steam pressure gradient in the thin air that is directly above the surface, affects the surface's evaporation rate due to immediate proportional evaporation with the difference between the saturation pressure on the surface of the surface of the surface of water temperature and the air vapor pressure on the thin layer, at the temperature of the water body, the harshness of the surface affects the radiation balance and also affects the evaporation that takes place, while the evaporation of the surface depends on the amount of moisture vapor available on the surface surface, the composition, the soil, the vegetation caption on it, and so forth. The evaporating surface size also affects the rate of evaporation because air mass can be modified while moving above large surface areas that may have a variation of air / water / surface temperature and variation of moisture and wind flow above large evaporation surfaces. The depth of the water body affects the rate of evaporation because of the lake's ability to store heat in summer and release it again in winter, thus affecting monthly or seasonal evaporation values.",

Astrobiology harnesses molecular biology, biophysics, biochemistry, chemistry, astronomy, physical cosmology, exo planetology and geology to investigate the possibility of life on other worlds and help identify biospheres that may be different from those on Earth. The origins and evolution of life were an integral part of the discipline of astrobiology. Astrobiology relates to the interpretation of existing scientific data.

Current studies on the planet Mars by Curiosity and Opportunity explorers are being conducted in search of evidence of ancient life as well as the plains associated with ancient rivers or lakes that may have been inhabited. The search for evidence of universality, tafonomy, and organic molecules on the planet Mars are now the primary objectives of NASA and ESA. Even if extraterrestrial life had never been discovered, the properties of inter-disciplinary astrobiology, and the cosmic perspectives and evolution that it created, could still produce various benefits on Earth. This term was first proposed by Russian astronomer Gavriil Tichov in 1953. Astrobiology is etymologically derived from the Greek \u25aaO\u03bd , astron, \"starrate, star\"; Ethymologically, bios, \"life\"; and --logical, learning. Synonyms of astrobiology vary; however, synonyms are structured in relation to the most important science implied in development: astronomy and biology. The closest synonym is the exobiology of the Greek \u0567, \"external\"; the \"alive,\" bios, \"alive\"; and the \"alive,\" -logia, study. The term exobiology was created by molecular biologists and Nobel Prize winner Joshua Lederberg. Exobiology is thought to have a limited scope on the search for life outside the Earth, while the field of subject is broader and investigates the relationship between life and the universe, which includes the search for life outside of the earth, but also includes the study of life on Earth, its origins, evolution and its limits.",

Since alternative chemical analogies with some of the processes of life have been created in the lab, xenobiology is now considered to be an existing subject. While as astrobiology is a growing and emerging field, the question of whether life exists elsewhere in the universe is a verifiable hypothesis and is thus a valid scientific path. Although once considered outside the mainstream of scientific investigation, astrophyology has become a field of formal study. Planet scientist David Grinspoon calls astrobiology a field of natural philosophy, underlying unknown speculations, in known scientific theories. NASA's interest in exobiology first began with the development of the U.S. Space Program. In 1959, NASA funded its first exobiological project, and in 1960, NASA founded an Exobiological Program, which is now one of the four major elements of the current NASA Astrobiology Program. In 1971, NASA funded an extraterrestrial search for intelligence to search radio frequencies of the electromagnetic spectrum for interstellar communication transmitted by extraterrestrial life outside the solar system.

A mission specifically designed to find life today on Mars is a Viking program and a Beagle 2. The Viking results were unconvinced and Beagle 2 failed minutes after landing. The future mission with a powerful astrobiological role is Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter who was designed to study the frozen months of Jupiter's \u25aa some of which might have liquid water if the mission hadn't been canceled.

When searching for life on other planets like Earth, some assumptions of simplification are useful to reduce the size of the astrobiological task. One is the assumption that most of the life forms in our galaxy are based on carbon chemistry, as are all life forms on Earth. Carbon is known for the enormous variety of molecules that can be formed around it. Carbon is the fourth most abundant element in the universe and the energy required to create or sever bonds is at the right level to build molecules that are not only stable, but also reactive. The fact that carbon atoms are easily bound to other carbon atoms allows them to form very long and complex molecules. The presence of liquid water is an assumed requirement, because it is a common molecule and provides an excellent environment for the formation of complex carbon-based molecules that can ultimately lead to the emergence of life. Some researchers place a mixture of ammonia-water environment as a possible solvent for other hypothetical biochemical types. The third assumption is focus on planets orbiting stars like the Sun to increase the possibility of planetary order. A huge star has a relatively short life span, which means that life may not have time to appear on a planet that orbits it. A very small star provides so small heat and warmth that only a planet with orbit so close around them that it will not freeze and in orbit that is so close and these planets will be \"locked\" on the star.",

Since the Earth is the only planet known to have life, there is no clear way to know if this simplification assumption is right or wrong. The study of communication with extraterrestrial intelligence focuses on constructing and deciphering messages that are theoretically understood by other technological civilizations. Human communication efforts include broadcasting mathematical language, pictures of Arecibo messages and computing approaches to detect and decipher communication in natural languages. The SETI program, for example, uses radio telescopes and optical telescopes to search for deliberate signals from extraterrestrial intelligence. While some of the most famous scientists like Carl Sagan have recommended sending messages into space, scientist Stephen Hawking warned him, thinking that aliens might attack the Earth just for his resources and then leave. Most of the astrophyological studies associated with astronomy are included in the detection categories of planets outside the solar system (exoplanet), the hypothesis is that if life appears on Earth, then it can also appear on other planets with similar characteristics. To that end, a number of instruments designed to detect exoplanets the size of the Earth have been considered, especially NASA Terrates Planet Finder (TPF) and Darwin ESA programs, both of which have been canceled. NASA launched Kepler's mission in March 2009, and the French Space Agency launched a COROT space mission in 2006. There are also some ground - based efforts that are not so ambitious as to go on.

Estimates for the number of planets with extraterretrial, intelligent communicative life can be obtained from Drake's equations, basically an equation that reveals the possibility of intelligent life as a product of factors such as a habitable fraction of the planet and a small part of the planet where life may arise: N=R\u00d7 fp fpp \u00d7 fl\u00d7 fi \u00d7 fc L{\\displaystile N=R^ }~ ~times ~f_p}~\\n ~f\\ttimes}~f\\f\\t\\s}\\stimes~f\\s\\s\\s\\sf\\sf\\c}~s\\t\\c} With the reason behind, however, while these equations may not convince the equation.

Biology cannot state that a process or a phenomenon, by being mathematically possible, must be forced into space objects. Biologists determine what's speculative and what's not. Extrophyil discovery, organisms capable of surviving in extreme environments, became a core research element for astrophyologists, because such organisms are essential to understanding the four limits of life within the planet's scope: the potential of panspermia, the contamination ahead because of the efforts of human exploration, the colonization of the planet by man, and the exploration of the extinct and still existence of extraterrial life. Until the 1970s, life was considered entirely dependent on the energy of the Sun. Plants on the Earth's surface draw energy from sunlight to photosynthesize sugar from carbon dioxide and water, releasing oxygen in a process that is then consumed by organisms that respond to oxygen, passing their energy onto the food chain. Even life in the depths of the oceans, where sunlight cannot reach, is considered to be either to eat organic detritus that is rained from the surface of the water or from eating the animals that do it. A planet's ability to support life is thought to depend on its access to sunlight. However, in 1977, during the exploration of Galapagos Rift in Alvin's underwater exploration, scientists discovered colonies of giant tube worms, shells, crustaceans, shells, and other creatures gathered around underwater volcanic features known as hydrothermal vents.

Another life form completely separated from the sun's rays is green sulfur bacteria that capture earth's heat light for anoxyogenic photosynthesis or bacteria that run chemotherapy based on radioactive decay of uranium. This chemotherapy revolutionizes biology and astrophyology studies by revealing that life doesn't have to depend on the sun, it only needs water and energy gradients to exist. Biologists have discovered extrophyils that thrive on ice, boiling water, acid, alkali, nuclear reactor water cores, salt crystals, toxic wastes and in other extreme habitats that were previously considered hostile to life. It opens up a new path in astrophyology by expanding massively the number of possible space habitats. The description of this organism, its environment and its evolutionary path, is considered an important component in understanding how life can evolve elsewhere in the universe. For example, some organisms capable of suppressing exposure to vacuum space and outer radiation include fungi liken Rhizocarpon geographicum and Xanthoria elegants, Bacculus safensis bacteria, Deinococcus radiovanans, Bacculus subtilis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae seeds, thalianas seeds (there are rat - eards), as well as invertebrata Tardida.

Oparin and Haldane attribute that conditions on the early Earth are conducive to the formation of organic compounds of inorganic elements and thus for the formation of many chemicals that are common to all the life forms that we see today. The study of this process, known as prebiotic chemistry, has made some progress, but it is still unclear whether life can form in such a way on Earth. Alternative panspermia hypothesis is that the first elements of life may have formed on other planets with more favorable conditions (or even in interstellar space, asteroids, etc.) And then it has been brought to Earth -- the panspermia hypothesis. The cosmic dust spreading across the universe contains a complex organic compound (\"an ammorphic solid with aromatic mixed structures\") that can be made naturally, and quickly by the star. Further, a scientist suggested that these compounds may be related to the development of life on Earth and said that, \"If this is the problem, life on Earth may be easier to start because these organic materials can serve as basic materials for life.\" More than 20% of the carbon in the universe can be attributed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, possibly early materials for the formation of life.

Only two natural atoms, carbon and silicon, are known to serve as the foundation of a molecule large enough to carry biological information. As a structural basis for life, one of the essential features of carbon is that it's unlike silicon, carbon can easily get involved in the formation of chemical bonds with many other atoms, thus enabling the chemical flexibility necessary to perform metabolism and biological attachments. The thought of where life might occur in the solar system is historically limited by the understanding that life ultimately depends on the light and warmth of the Sun and therefore, confined to the surface of the planet. The four most likely candidates for life in the solar system are the planet Mars, the Jovian Europa, and Saturn's satellites, Titan and Enceladus. Mars, Enceladus, and Europa are considered to be potential candidates in the search for life primarily because they may have underground liquid water, an essential molecule for life as we know it for its use as a solvent in cells. Water on Mars was found frozen in its polar ice sheet, and newly carved trenches were observed on Mars indicating that liquid water might exist, at least temporarily, on the surface of the planet. At low temperatures and low pressure on Mars, liquid water tends to be very salty. As for Europa and Enceladus, a global ocean of liquid water lies beneath the cold outer layer of ice from these months. This water may be warmed to liquid form by volcanic vents at the bottom of the ocean, but the main heat source may be tidal warming.",

Titan has been described as having conditions similar to those of the Earth at the beginning of its formation. On its surface, scientists have discovered the first liquid lake outside the Earth, but this lake appears to consist of ethane and/or methane, rather than water. Some scientists believe that this liquid hydrocarbon might replace water in living cells that are different from what is on Earth. After Cassini's data was studied, it was reported in March 2008 that Titan may also have an underground ocean of liquid water and ammonia. Measuring the ratio of hydrogen and methane levels on Mars can help determine the possibilities of life on Mars. According to scientists, \"the low H2/CH4 ratio (less than about 40) suggests that life may exist and be active.\" Other scientists have recently reported methods of detecting hydrogen and methane in the atmosphere of extraterrestrial bodies. The complex organic compounds of life, including urasil, cytosine, and thymine, have been formed in labs in extraterrestrial conditions, using early chemicals such as pyridin, found in meteorites.

This trial decided not to change Vinaya, and Moggaputita-Tissa as the head of the trial finished Katavatthu's book of deviations from another stream. Just then Abhidhamma was inserted. After that these teachings were written and ratified by the trial. Then Y.M. Mahinda (King Asoka's son) brought this Tipitaka to Sri Lanka without anything missing until now and spread Buddha Dhamma there. There this teaching is known as Theravada. The holy book used in the Buddhist religion Theravada is the temple of Tripitaka known as the Canon Pali (Pali Canon). The oldest Buddhist holy book, known to date, is written in ancient Pali/Magadhi, divided into three large groups (called \"pitaka\" or \"chamber\"): Vinaya Pitaka, Sutta Pi countedaka, and Abhidhamma Pitaka. Because there are three groups, the Buddhist Scriptures are called Tipitaka (Pali). There are four major holidays in Buddhism. But the only thing that's widely known to society is the Waisak Trisucic holiday, as well as the only Buddhist holiday that makes it an Indonesian national holiday every year.",

Waisak Day is also known as Puja or Purnima Buddha in India, Vesak in Malaysia and Singapore, Visakha Bucha in Thailand, and Vesak in Sri Lanka. This name is derived from the Pali \"Wesakha\" language, which in turn is also related to \"Waishakha\" from Sanskrit's Day Kathine was the offering ceremony of a robe to Sangha after serving Vassa. So after Vassa's time ended, the Buddhists entered the time of Katina or the month of Katina. In such occasions, in addition to offering Kathina's robes, Buddhists also prime the basic needs of the Bhikchu, the vihara equipment, and the prime for the development and progress of Buddhist religion. The convention to commemorate Asadha's great Day is called Asadha Puja / Bareha Puja. Asadha's Day, commemorated 2 (two) months after the Waisak Festival, to commemorate the event in which Buddha stripped Dharma for the first time to 5 hermits (Penca Vagiya) in the Isippatana Deer Park, in 588 B.C. The five hermits were Kondanna, Bhadiya, Vappa, Mahanama and Asajji, and after listening to Dharma's talk, they reached the direction. Five hermits, ex-friends struggling Buddhas in tormenting themselves in the Uruvela forest were the happiest people, because they had the chance to listen to Dhamma for the first time. Next, along with the Panca Vagghiya the Bhikkhu, the Buddha formed Arya Sangha Sangkkhu the First Sisterhood of the Holy Bhikkhu (Bhikhu). With the formation of the Sanghaji (Gabriel), Tiratana (Tharatna) will be complete. Earlier, there was just Buddha and Dhamma (discovered by Buddha).",

With the support of merchants, the cave monastery was established largely along trade routes throughout Central Asia. By the second century B.C.E., some Central Asian cities such as Khotan had become an important center for Buddhism.

The term Idealism is a flow of philosophy that views mental and ideals as the key to reality. From the 17th to the beginning of the 20th century, this term is widely used in philosophical clarifying. Idealism gives the doctrine that the essence of the physical world can only be understood in its reliance on the soul and the spirit. This term is derived from \"idea,\" which is something present in the soul. In modern philosophy, this view was first seen in George Barkeley (1685-1753) which states that the nature of physical objects is ideas. Leibniz used this term at the beginning of the 18th century, naming Plato's thinking against Epicurus materialism. Idealism has its own epistemological argument. Hence, the thetheism figures that teach that matter depends on spirit are not called idealists because they do not use tang epistemological arguments used by idealism. They use arguments that say that physical objects are ultimately God's creations; the arguments of idealists say that physical objects cannot be understood apart from spirits. Idealism comes from the word idea which means the world in the soul (Plato), so this view puts more emphasis on ideas, and lowers material and physical things. The reality itself is explained by the symptoms of psychics, spirits, graces, self, absolute minds, not materialities. Other figures are quite numerous ; Barkeley, Jonathan Edwards, Howison, Edmund Husserl, Messer and so on.

Its adherents believe in the existence of knowledge thought to be mere belief or dogma. The word skeptic comes from a sceptic word that according to the Great English Dictionary (KBI) means lack of confidence or doubt about the success of teachings and so on. Ethymologically, scepticism comes from the Greek or 'to consider'. Skeptics do not have to be understood as negative attitudes that immediately doubt something and do not believe in the existence of knowledge. Because in doing so, skeptics question things by conveying structured arguments to raise doubts for an accurate and adequate explanation. Formally, skepticism is an interesting topic in philosophy, especially epistemology. Whereas informally skepticalism can be applied to any topic, such as politics, religion, or pseudoscience. It is often applied to a limited domain, such as morality, theism, or supernaturality. Tom Friedman of the New York Times says that skeptics are always the attitude to question things, to doubt what is accepted, and to be on guard against being deceived. A skeptic would say: \"I don't think that's true. I'll check it out.\" In everyday use, skepticism can be defined as an attitude of doubt or a tendency toward disbelief, both in general and in certain objects. Skepticism can also be called the doctrine that knowledge is not a certainty, a method of judgment suspended, structured doubt, or characteristic of skeptical criticism. Whereas in philosophy, skepticalism can refer to methods of investigation that emphasize critical oversight, caution, and intellectual care; methods of gaining knowledge through structured doubt and constant testing; a set of demands regarding the limitations of human knowledge and the appropriate response to those limitations.",

        "paragraph": "Skepticism can be classified by its level of doubt. In philosophy, there are at least three mappings of skepticalism. First, the skepticalism that Aristotle introduced, which was the procrastination of judgment and the questioning of all conjectures and knots, so that people were forced to justify themselves with critical analysis. Second, the skepticism introduced in Immanuel Kant's phenomenalism, that knowledge is associated only with experience or phenomenon and the human mind is incapable of knowing the source or foundation of experience. Third, the skeptics that the Gorgias of the Greek sophis, the impossible to achieve knowledge and search for the truth, are futile. Skepticism as an understanding can be inherited from ancient Greece. There's nothing we can know for sure, no one is certain, I doubt, a statement to be protested for having a paradox. If there's nothing to know, how do you know that? If nothing is certain, the words themselves are certain. At least he's convinced he's having second thoughts. Skeptics can also be considered traits. Sometimes we do it without even realizing it. When we hear that there's a story we kidnapped, of course we're frowning. Then we don't believe it so easily, we consider it a mock, urban legend, a fake. Skeptics can give arguments against the story. They're asking for evidence, presenting the fact that the story is impossible and so on. In other words doubtful. Skepticity means doubtful things. Don't take it lightly just the way it is. Always doubting something if there's no evidence that's really obvious. If there's a story, then don't believe it right away. This kind of nature is important to science.

This is because in the world there are many impostors and liars, there are those who claim to see things when they are not there. There are also those who feel that they are seeing things when they are not. If the scientific community is going to believe something like this without evidence and ask others to believe, then science will be filled with things that can't be trusted. Skepticism is a stand in epistemology that doubts both its characteristics and its existence. Skepticists have existed since ancient Greece, but in modern philosophy, Ren\u00e9 Descartes is the pioneer of this attitude in scientific methods. The chagrin of descartes in its method of chagrin is skeptical, but that kind of skepticalism is methodical, because the final goal is to get unshakable certainty, which is: cogito or subjectum as the final instance of human knowledge. In the philosophy of D. Hume we find radical scepticism, because it doubts not only causal relationships, but also the presence of substance or the final reality that remains. In classical philosophy, questioning refers to teachings about skepticoi. In philosophy, from what they say they \"express nothing but sight of their own.\" In this case, philosophical doubt or Pyrrhonism is a position of philosophy that must suspend one decision in the investigation.

Haught, who divided the approach to science and religion, into the approach of conflict, contrast approach, contact approach, and confirmation approach. To that end, Haught briefly discussed four ideas about scientific and religious relationships, as follows: Conflicting approaches, a belief that science and religion essentially cannot be combined. It means that many scientific thinkers think that religion can never be reconciled to science. Each was in a different position, science tested all his hypothesis and all his theories based on experience, whereas religion was based on belief. Scientific skeptics often say religion puts it on the assumptions of apriori or \u25aathe beliefs of Tirzah, whereas science doesn't want to accept everything just as it's right. According to scientists, it is too much for religion to rely on wild imagination, while science accumulates on observable facts. Religion is too emotional, passionate and subjective, while science strives to be impartial, not overzealous, and objective. Thus, the struggle between the two could not easily have been done. Both of them have a fundamental difference so that trying to encrypt them in one \u25aakota box will certainly trigger some issues, particularly related to conceptual clashes, methodological and ontologists between \u25efsains and\u2581perasaantical religion.

Therefore, both must be separated from one another. If religion and science both tried to do the same job, of course they would contradict. Science and religion really have different tasks and keep science and religion in their jurisdictions. So religion and science need not interfere with each other's affairs. Contact approaches, an approach that seeks dialogues, interactions, and the possibility of an adjustment in the science and religion, and primarily seeks ways in which science affects religious and theological understanding. A way to connect religion with science, because Haught, is not willing to let the world fall apart into two domains. Yet, he also disagreed with the shallow harmony of the smelting approach. So according to him, this approach agrees that science and religion are clearly different logically and linguistically, but in the real world, they cannot be boxed absolutely, as expected by contrast approach. The word of questioning can describe a position on a claim, but in others it is often explained that sets up an eternity of thought and approach to receiving or rejecting new information.

There are different colors of human hair. But the natural color is quite divided into six large groups: black, brown, blonde, auburn, red and gray. Auburn means rosy chocolate. The gray-and-white hair is found only in parents, albinos, and in some cases tyrosine deficiencies. What regulates the color of human hair? Pigmen that regulate hair color are two kinds of eumelanin and feomelanin. Remember that melanin is not the same as melanin. Melanin is a dark brown pigment; it regulates the different colors of human \u25aabiologists. From skin color to irises to hair color. The albinos suffer from a fairly heavy melanin deficit, so it's almost no melanin at all on its skin. Whereas melamin is a plastic that is used as a layer for various households and industries; which are often inserted into milk to increase nitrogen levels, but can cause kidney dysfunction. Eumelanin (which means true melanin) gives the hair a dark color. Judging from its chemical structure, the eumelanin is a protein containing the amino acids of the tirosine. Eumelanin formation requires a tirosinase enzyme, which combines the amino acid tirosin to the dopa and dopamine molecules. Tirosinase is more active in adults than in children or teenagers.

Its systematic name is sulfaneediide and sulfides, a valid IUPAC name, defined according to the substitutive and additive names. However, sulfide names are also used in the compositional IUPAC names regardless of the nature of the bond involved. The example of the naming is the selenium disupida and titanium sulfide, which contains no sulfide ions at all. Sulfida is also used non-systemically, to describe compounds that release hydrogen sulfides in acid, or compounds containing sulfur in some forms, such as dipmetil sulfide. The hydrogen sulfide itself is an example of the non-systematic name of this trait. However, it is also a trivial name, and the name IUPAC prefers to sulfana. Sulfida is not in sufficient concentration, even in very alkalys water, undetected in pH < ~15 (MNOH). Anion sulfide can assimilate protons with recombination: Because of proton capture (H+), sulfide has a base character. In a acute solution, it has a pKb value less than 0. The conjugated acid is boilfida. In a acute solution, most sulfide ions are neutralized. After being treated with standard acid, sulfide turns into hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and metal salt.

One of the most famous examples is the bright yellow species of CdS or yellow cadmium. The black stain formed on pure silver is Ag2S. Such species are sometimes referred to as salt.

Bamboo is also known as preng or pring in Javanese, awi or tamiang or haur or sunda, tabatimo in Ternate, and ute in Ambon. In this world bamboo is one of the fastest growing plants. Because it has a unique rhizoma-dependent system, in a day bamboo can grow up to 60 centimeters (24 Inchi) or more, depending on the soil conditions and climatology where it is planted. The Olyreae (tropicwood bambusae) Arundinarieae (a medium - wood bambu) Pooideae Oryzoideae has two generally shaped bamboos from the Aruninariae and Bambuseae, and grass bamboo from the Olyreae tribe. Molecular analysis of the banada indicates that there are between three and five major lineages of bamboo. Bamboo is classified to over 10 genus and 1450 species. Bamboo species are found in various climate locations, from the cold climate of mountains to the hot tropics. They are found along East Asia from 50o Northern Litang in Sakhalin to the north of Australia, and in western India to the Himalayas. They are also found in sub-Saharan Africa, and in America from the middle of the North American Atlantic to the south to Argentina and Cili, reaching the southernmost point of Bamboo on 47o Litang South. The European continent has no native bamboo species. Recently attempted to grow bamboo commercially at the Great Lake of Africa in eastern Central Africa, especially Rwanda.

But this rate of growth is largely determined by local soil conditions, climate conditions, and species types. The most common growth rate is about three feet [1.2,103.9 in] per day. Bamboo once grew massively during the Cretaceous period, in what is now Asia. Some of the largest bamboo species can grow to exceed 30 feet [30 m] (98 ft) in height, and they can reach a diameter of a 15 - foot - inch - long (5,9:7,9 in) rod. But certain species can only grow to a few inches. Bamboo is a family of grasses, which can explain why bamboo has a high growth rate. This means that when bamboo is harvested, bamboo will grow back quickly without disturbing the ecosystem. Unlike trees, bamboo stems emerge from a full diameter and grow to a maximum height in one growing season (about 3 to 4 months). During those few months, each sprout that appears will grow vertically without growing branches until the age of maturity is reached. Then branches grew from nodes and leaves appeared. The following year, the walls of stems containing the pup will harden. By the third year, the rod was getting harder. By the fifth year, mold can grow on the outside of the rod and penetrate inside and rot the stem. Until the eighth year (depends on species), mold growth will cause bamboo stems to decay and collapse. This indicates that bamboo is best harvested when it is between three and seven years of age. Bamboo will not grow or expand its stem after the first year, and the bamboo that has collapsed or been harvested will not be replaced by new bamboo shoots where it once grew.",

Some of those cold-resistant bamboos are able to survive up to zone 5-6 in the USDA Plant Hardiness Zones category, even though eventually they will tear down the leaves and stop growth, but the ricoma will survive and grow new bamboo shoots in the next spring. Bamboo of the Phyllostachys genus is categorized as an invasive species in the United States and trades and large amounts are illegal. Parts of bamboo like buds, twigs, and leaves are the main food source of pandas in China, red pandas in Nepal, and bamboo lemurs in Madagascar. Rats eat bamboo fruit, African mountain gorillas also eat bamboo and have been documented to consume fermented and alcohol - filled bamboo lime. Chimpanzees and elephants also eat parts of bamboo stems. Larvas from bamboo holes (The Omphisa fuscidentalis) in Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and China feed on living bamboo pulps. The moth's larvae serve as local food. Most bamboo blooms are very rare. In fact, bamboo only blooms at intervals 5 to 120 years. Mass interest in certain species differs in time. The longest mass flowering period is bamboo of the species Phyllostachys bamboooids. This species blooms en masse at the same time despite geographical separation and climate, and after that bamboo will die leaving its ricoma. This flower has a small impact, thus indicating the presence of a biological alarm inside the cell that triggers energy rationing to produce flowers and stop vegetative growth. This mechanism, including its causes, remains a question. One hypothesis that explains the evolution of mass interest is to \"fill\" predators, where flowering and fertilization at the same time will increase their seed population survival by flooding the area with fruit so predators will eat what they need and then leave the remaining seeds to grow into new plants.",

And adult bamboo that dies before it blooms will be more effective if it's not preserved as an energy storage mechanism to perform the flowering. Another hypothesis is based on the theory of bamboo forest fires, where mass death after flowering triggers habitat disorders. Bamboo that dries up on grains that have fallen on the ground can trigger forest fires caused by lightning strikes. Because bamboo can become an aggressive plant, and new bamboo shoots can prevent the growth of other plants so that they can master land. But both hypotheses are questionable for various reasons. The hypothetical \"infection\" of predators does not explain in detail why mass flowering takes up to 10 times the age of ratdent life. And the bamboo fire hypothesis is doubtful because there's no evidence of a bamboo forest fire caused by a lightning strike; almost all of it is caused by humans. And the theory of the use of lightning strikes as the only reason in the progress of bamboo evolution is doubt because lightning strikes is a very unexpected natural event. Although lightning - struck forest fires actually occur within a period of time, the evolution of life on earth is in some places. And the species of Pinus contorta plants require ecological triggers such as forest fires to spread seeds faster, and the Sequoiadendron giganteum needs forest fires to allow their shoots to dominate the forest. Mass interest also has economic and ecological effects. The appearance of bamboo fruit that can dramatically trigger the growth of the Rodent population, thus triggering the destruction of local farm plants.

In some cases mass interest triggers the emergence of a new cultivar in the area with characteristics that differ from the previous bamboo population. So the next period of interest may not be the same as the previous flowering period. Bamboo grows by spreading its shear and ricoma underground. It can be huge, and if not controlled, it can cause shoots to grow in unwanted places, even potentially invasive. How wide the bamboo coils spread is determined by the local soil and climate types. Rizoma that is in the ground can be cut if desired, and if the riboma is separated from its primary body, it usually dies. bamboo wood is produced from cultured bamboo and wild bamboo, usually from the genus Phyllostachys. In Indonesia, bamboo materials are produced among them by Bambusa clans (for example, bamboo ample), Dendrocalamus (e.g. bamboo tungs, and Gigantochloa (e.g. bamboo ater, bamboo buds). The bamboo used for construction activities must be harvested when the stem reaches its highest strength and when the sugar levels in the stem are in the lowest condition, since its existence makes it easier for the bamboo to be attacked by pests. Laundry or surveillance is the disassembling of bamboo sap after harvesting. In many places in the world, sap levels are reduced in various ways: In the process of washing, bamboo is slowly dried out in the shade to prevent the crack of the bamboo outer layer. According to Stebbings, from the results of his experiments, surveillance by soaking bamboo in water for five days, followed by drying and soaking in the \"Rangoon oil\" for 48 hours, can preserve bamboo for telegraph poles from powder beetle attacks for at least a year. To prolong the fatigue, he recommends prolonging the period of soaking in water until all the sap contained in reeds is dissolved in water.",

The four figures appearing in both records were Critias and Hermocrates along with the philosopher Socrates and Timaeus, although only the Critias spoke of Atlantis.

In the book Timaeus, Plato told the story: Critis mentions a story that is thought to be history that will provide a perfect example, followed by the description of Atlantis. In his notes, ancient Athens represents \"perfect community\" and Atlantis is its enemy, representing a perfectly antithesis described in Republic.

The Atlantisns then built a bridge to the north of the mountains, making a route to the rest of the island. They dug a large canal into the sea, and by the bridge, a cave was made toward a stone ring so that ships could pass through and enter the cities around the mountains; they made piers from the rock walls of the trench.

Next, mine materials are transported to Bayer's process. Bayer's process produced an alumina (Al2O3) by washing aluminum - containing mines with sodium hydroxide solution Al careoH) 3. Aluminium hydroxide is then heated at a little over 1000 OC so it forms an alumina and H2O into water vapor. Once Alumina is produced, an alumina is taken to the Hall-Heroult process.

In the process of Hall-Herorault, oxide aluminum is dissolved in the melting of the clilit (Na3AlF6) in a steel-plated graphite that serves at the same time as a cathod. Next electrolysis occurs at a temperature of 950 \u00b0C. As anode used a graphite rod. Once the Al2O3 is obtained purely, the next process is Al2O3 electrolysis. In this electrolysis Al2O3 is mixed with the CaF2 and 2-8% of the kriolit (Na3AlF6) which works to lower the melting point of Al2O3 (pure Al2O3 melting point to 2000 \u00b0C), the mixture will fuse at temperatures between 850-950 \u00b0C. The anode and the cat code are made of graphite.

But electricity can be increased as needed, as in industrial needs. The alumina is experiencing an electrolysis disconnect, a molten aluminum will head down the pot, which will regularly be held towards cylinder - shaped molds or plates. Each of these pots can produce 66,000 to 110,000 tons of aluminum per year. In general, four tons of bauxite will produce two tons of alumina, which will eventually produce a ton of aluminum. The technical properties of pure aluminum and aluminum compounds are influenced by the concentration of materials and treatment given to the material. Aluminium is known for its resistance to corrosion. This is caused by a pastivation phenomenon, the process of forming aluminum oxide layers on the surface of aluminum metals as soon as metals are exposed to the free air. This aluminum oxide layer prevents further oxidation. Yet, pastivation can be slower if combined with more cathodic metals, since it prevents aluminum oxidation. Tensil force is a huge voltage obtained when it's done tensil testing. Tensil force is shown by the highest value of voltage on the voltage curves of testing results, and it usually happens when the necking happens.

The combined violence of the various traits found in a material that prevents a deformation from occurring in the material when applied to a force. The violence of a material is influenced by elasticity, plasticity, viscoelasity, tensil powers, ducticity, and so on. Violence can be tested and measured in various methods. The most common are Brinnel, Vickers, Mohs, and Rockwell's methods. The violence of pure aluminum is very small, about 65 on the Brinnel scale, so with few styles can change the shape of metal. For applications that require violence, aluminum needs to be combined with other metals and/or treated thermally or physically. Aluminium at 4.4% Cu and treated quenching, and then stored at high temperatures can have a Brinnel violence level of 135. Ductility is defined as a mechanical trait of a material to explain how far the material can be plastically altered without a fracture. In a tensil test, ductility is shown by its nesting shape; materials with high ductility will experience very narrow nerding, whereas materials that have low ductility, barely have a necking. While in the test results of tensils, ductility is measured by a scale called intangation. Elongation is how long a material increases when a tensil force test takes place. Elongation is written in a percentage of length increase per the initial length of the tested material. Pure aluminum has a high ductity. The alloy aluminum has a variety of ductility, depending on the concentration of the mixture, but generally it has lower ductility than pure aluminum, because the ductility is reversed by tensil powers, and almost all alloys have a tensil power higher than pure aluminum.",

Recycling involves the process of liquidizing aluminum, a process that requires only 5% of the energy used to produce aluminum from ore.

Heavy drop percentages are also caused by recycled aluminum types. Aluminium thin plate has a much greater weight loss rate than thicker aluminum plates. Although the aluminum recycled has lower levels than the aluminum produced, the recyclable aluminum still retains the same physical properties as the production of aluminum. The product of aluminum recycling is called a secondary aluminum term. Secondary aluminum is produced in various formats and used at 80% of intermediate injections. Another important use is struction. The white garbage that is waste from primary aluminum production and from secondary recycling still contains a number of industrial extractable aluminum. This process produces aluminum billets, together with very complex waste materials. The waste of aluminum processes is very difficult to manage. Water - stricken wastes will release a mixture of gases (including hydrogen, acetylene, and ammonia), which spontaneously merge during exposure to air; waste contact with damp air will release ammonia gases.

The goal of mitosis is to grow and regenerate that produces two child cells identical to the original stem cell. Mitosis only happens once and only lasts during somatization. Mitosis is generally followed by cytokinesis that divides the cytoplasm and the cell membrane. This process produces two identical child cells, which have almost identical organelle distribution and cell components. Mitosis and cytocenesis are phases of mitosis (M phase) in the cell cycle, where early cells are divided into two child cells that have the same genetics as the early cells. Mitosis occurs only in eukariot cells. In multicellular organisms, somatic cells experience mitosis, whereas genital cells (which will be sperm to male or female eggs) divide through a different process called meiosis. Procariot cells that don't have nuclei go through what's called binary cleavage. Because cytokinesis generally occurs after mitosis, the term \"mythosis\" is often used to state \"phase mitosis.\" It is important to note that many cells perform mitosis and cytokinesis separately, forming single cells with several nucleuses. This, for example, is done by fungi and smooth moulds. In animals, cytokinesis and mitosis can also occur separately, such as at a certain stage in the development of the fruit fly embryo. The main result of mitosis is the division of the early cell genome to two child cells. The genome consists of a number of chromosomes, which is a convoluted DNA complex that contains vital genetic information to perform cell functions correctly.

A green-leafed vegetable like spinach is also rich in magnesium. In Britain, the daily value recommended for magnesium is 300 mg for men and 270 mg for women. In the U.S. Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) is 400 mg for 19 - year - old males and 420 mg for older women; for women 310 mg for the age of 19 JUH30 and 320 mg for older ones. Some forms of magazine pharmaceutical preparation and food supplements are available. In two human trials, magnesium oxide is one of the most common forms of magnesium diet supplements due to a high weight of magnesium content, but its vitality is lower than magnesium cirat, chloride, lactate or aspartate. Adults have 2210 grams of magnesium, with 60% in skeletons, 39% intrasels (20% in skeleton muscles), and extrasels 1%. The serum levels are usually 0.7101.0 mmol/L or 1.8 JULI2.4 mEq/L. Magnesium serum levels can be normal even if magnesium intrasel is lacking. The mechanism for maintaining magnesium levels in the serum is a variety of renal gastrointinal and excretions.

It's the rarest natural element in the Earth's crust, just as the decaying product of various heavier elements. All isotopes astatin are short-lived; the most stable are astatin-210, with an 8.1-hour period. A pure astatin sample was never made, since each of its macroscopic specimens will soon be applied by its own heat radioactivity. The nature of most astatins is not known for certain. Many of these properties come from estimates from astatin positions on the periodic table as heavier analog iodines, and halogen members (groups of elements containing fluorine, chlorin, bromin and iodine). However, asstatin also runs along the barrier between metal and nonlogam, so some metal behavior has also been observed and predicted for it. Astatin tends to have a dark or shiny appearance and perhaps a semiconductor or maybe a metal. Chemically, some species of astatin anonycs are known and most of the compounds are similar to iodine, but sometimes they also show the characteristics of metals and show some similarities to silver. The first analysis of this element was carried out in 1940 by Dale R. Corson, Kenneth R. MacKenzie, and Emilio G. Segr\u00e8 at the University of California, Berkeley, which was named from the ancient Greek 'unstable'. Four isotopes of astatin were later found to occur naturally, although much less than one gram were present at a certain time in the Earth's crust. Neither isotop astatin-210 is the most stable, nor isstatin-211 medically useful, nor does it occur naturally; they can only be produced synthetically, usually by bombarding bismut-209 with alpha particles.

The nature of most astatins is not known for certain. Research is limited by the short period of its beak, which prevents the creation of weighed quantity. A visible piece of astatin will soon evaporate itself because of the heat produced by its intense radioactivity. It still needs to be seen if, with enough cooling, the amount of astatin macroscopic can be stored as a thin film. Astatin is usually classified as nonlogam or metaloid; metal formation has also been predicted. Most of the astatin's physical properties have been estimated (by interpolation or extrapolation), using methods derived theoretically or empirically. For example, halogens become darker with an atom's weight increasing by almost noncolored fluorine, green - yellow chlorine, brown - red bromin, and dark gray iodine. Astatin is sometimes described as perhaps black solids (by assuming following this trend), or has a metal look (if it is metaloid or metal). Astatin is easier to immerse than iodine, since it has lower steam pressure. Nevertheless, half the amount of astatin given will evaporate within about an hour if placed on a clean glass surface at room temperature.a] Spectrum absorption at mid ultraungu area has a line at 224.401 and 216,225 nm, showing the transition of 6p to 7s.

Reduced radiolysis induced astatin effects from labeling chemicals and carrier molecules are other areas that require further development. The practical application for astatin as a cancer treatment is potentially suitable for a number of patients who \"surprisingly\"; the production of astatin in the amount that will be needed remains a problem.p] Research on animals shows that asstatin, similar to iodine \u25aa although at a lower level, perhaps because its slightly more metal is concentrated primarily (and dangerous) in the thyroid gland. Unlike iodine, astatin also shows a tendency to be absorbed by the lungs and spleen, possibly because of the oxidation of Atur into At+ inside the body. If given in the form of a radiocoloid tends, it concentrates on the heart. The experiments on rats and monkeys show that astatin-211 caused far greater damage to the thyroid gland than the 131 iodine, with repeated injection of nuclides that caused necrosis and dysplasia of cells inside the thyroid gland. Early research shows that astatin injections to female rodents cause morphological changes in breast tissue; these conclusions remain controversy over the years.

The endoflagela and the cylindrical protoplasma will be wrapped with layers of flexible membranes. This membrane is referred to as the outermost layer. The motility or movement of these bacteria is regulated by one or more flagellas in each part of the bacteria' polarity. At spirochetes, its flagelata is located in the periplasm of the cell and is referred to as the endoflagela Spirochetes have a unique motility model. The endoflagela that it has is found on the tip of this bacteria and can have a 2/3 cell length of footing. This bacteria moves by stretching or flexing by taking advantage of the endoflagela rotation. When both endoflageles rotate in the same direction and the protoplasma cylinder moves in the opposite direction then the spirochetes cells can move or move. According to habitats, pathogenic, philogenic, and morphological and physiological properties, the spirochetes can be distinguished into 8 genus. Spirochaeta has anaerobics and faerobative aerobatives and can live freely in academic environments such as water and river mud, lakes, oceans, and ponds. For example, the vast S. plenatilis is found in fresh water and in ocean habitats that cling to H2S. Another example is S. stenostrepa and S. aurtia. Meanwhile, Christispira is scattered on some form of crystal from a mollusc animal like oysters and shells. If the mollusc animal moves or rotates then the presence of the Christispira bacteria can be observed directly. This is because the bacteria are large enough in size. Treponema is an anaerobic species of spirochetes and is a parasite in humans and animals (called comensal bacteria) a sample of Treponema species is T. pallidum, T. denticola, T. primita, T. azotonutizium, T. saccharophilum, and others.",

The species of T. saccharophilum can live on a ruminansian digestive organ of anaerobic rummen. These bacteria play a role in the conversion of plant polycacidal acids into volatile fatty acids as a source of ruminansia animal energy. T. Saccharophilum can ferment pectin, starch, inulin, and other polycacidal plants. These two genus are made up of aerobic bacteria that use long chain fat acids, such as oleic acid as a source of carbon and electron donors. Leptospira characteristics are thin, wrapped around, and usually one end bends into a hook. Rodensia, dogs, and pigs are some of the natural hosts of leptoira. The example of Leptospira is L. biflexa which is free cells and L. Interrogants that are parasitic microorganisms. In humans, Leptospira can cause leptospirosis, a disorder caused by the accumulated bacteria in the kidneys and can lead to kidney failure to death. Leptospira can enter the body through the mucous membrane, or the skin. After multiplication in different areas of the body, the bacteria will accumulate in the kidneys and exit the body through urine. To eliminate these bacteria from the kidneys, therapy can be performed using penicillin, streptomycin, or tetracyclin. The prevention of infection of this disease can be done by vaccinating distemper-leptospira-hepatitis at home. Most of Borrelia's species are pathogens in animals and humans.

Rubidium is a very soft gray whiteish metal in an alkaline metal class. rubidium metals have something in common with potassium metals and cesium metals in physical appearance, tenderness and conductivity. Rubidium cannot be stored under the oxygen of the atmosphere, because a very high exermic reaction will occur, sometimes even causing these metals to burn. Rubidium was the first alkali metal in its class that had a mass higher than water, so it sank, unlike the metal on it in its class. Rubidium has a standard atomic weight of 85,4678. On Earth, the natural rubidium consists of two isotopes: 72% of which are stable 85Rb, and the remaining 28% are a slightly radioactive 87Rb, with a part time of 48.8 billion years of refuge over three times the age of the universe. German chemist Robert Bunsen and Gustav Kirchhoff discovered the rubidium in 1861 with a newly developed technique of fire spectroscopy. The name of this element comes from the Latin rubidus, which means dark red, from the color spectrum of emissions. The rubidium compound has various chemical and electronic applications. The rubidium metal is easily applied and has a comfortable range of spectral absorption, making it a target that is often used to manipulate atoms with lasers. Rubidium is not the known nutrient for any living organism. However, the rubidium ions have the same properties and the same charge as potassium ions, and are actively taken and treated by animal cells in the same way.

Rubidium has very low ionization energy, only 406 kJ/mol. Rubidium and potassium show a very similar purple color in the flame test, and to distinguish those two elements require more sophisticated analysis, like spectroscopy. Needs references to Rubidium chloride (RbCl) may be the most widely used rubidium compounds: among some other chlorides, it is used to induce living cells to take DNA; it is also used as biomarkets, because in nature, it is found only in small quantities in living organisms and if there is, it replaces potassium. Other common rubidium compounds are corrosive rubidium (RbOH), the original materials for most of the rubidium-based chemical processes; the rubidium carbonate (Rb2CO3), used in some optical glass, and the sulfate copper rubidium, Rb2SO4\u00b7CUO4\u00b76H2O.

It easily replaces potassium in minerals, and therefore it's quite widespread. Rb has been widely used in rock calendars; 87Rb decays through beta decay into stable 87Sr. During fractional crystallization, Sr tends to concentrate in plagiax, leaving Rb in a liquid phase. Therefore, the ratio of Rb/Sr in the remaining magma can increase over time, and the growing differentiation produces rock with increased Rb/Sr ratios. The highest ratio (10 or more) occurs in pegmatites. If the number of early Sr is known or can be extrapolated, then its age can be determined by the measurement of Rb and Sr concentration and the ratio 87Sr/86Sr. The date shows the mineral's true age only if it doesn't change.

Because of the bright red line in the disemboweled spectrum, they chose a name derived from the Latin rubidus, which means \"red.\" Rubidium is a minor component of lepidolith. Kirchhoff and Bunsen process 150 kg of lepidolite with only 0.24% rubidium monoxide (Rb2O). Both potassium and rubidium form salt that does not dissolve with chloroplate acid, but the salts show a slight difference in the solution in hot water. Hence, less so - called hexlooplatinate rubidium (Rb2PtCl6) can be obtained with fractional crystallization. After hexlooplatinate reduction with hydrogen, that process produces 0.51 grams of rubidium chloride (RbCl) for further study. Bunsen and Kirchhoff began the first large - scale isolation of cesium and rubidium compounds with 44,000 liters (12,000 US gal) of mineral water, which produced 7.3 grams of cesium chloride and 9.2 grams of rubidium chloride. Rubidium was the second element, shortly after cesium, found with spectroscopy, just one year after the discovery of spectroscope by Bunsen and Kirchhoff.

Knowledge comes when a person uses his common sense to identify certain objects or events that have never been seen or felt before. For example, when a person tastes cooking that he just met, he finds the knowledge of the food's shapes, flavors, and aromas. Knowledge is information that has been combined with understanding and the potential to do so; which is then attached to one's mind. Generally speaking, knowledge has a predictive ability to identify something as a result of a pattern.

The knowledge that a person has of course comes from a variety of sources. Here is the source of knowledge: In the eyes of philosophers, reason is a source of knowledge.

He's been articulated into formal language and could be relatively easily spread widely. The most common form of explicit knowledge is how-to hint usage, procedure, and video. Knowledge can also be audio-visual. The work of art and product design can also be viewed as an explicit form of knowledge that is the externalization of human skills, motives and knowledge. How to make implicit knowledge explicit is the primary function of the Science Management strategy.

A supersymmetric extension to the Standard Model can solve major hierarchy problems in size theory, guaranteeing that the square divergence of all sequences will cancel in disorder theory. In supersymmetry, every particle of one group will have an associated particle on the other side, known as superpartner, a different spin by a half-round number. These superparters are going to be new and undiscovered particles; for example, there's going to be a particle called a \"superparter electron,\" a bosonic pair of electrons. In the simplest supersymmetry theory, with \"unbroken\" supersymmetry, every couple from superpartner-superpartner would share the same mass and internal quantum number other than spin. Since we expect to find this superpartner using today's equipment, if supersymmetry exists then it's made up of a spontaneous fracture of symmetry, allowing a different superparter-superpartner in the mass. Spontaneous supersymmetry solves all problems in physics particles, including hierarchy problems. There is no evidence at this time that supersymmetry is right, or whether any other extensions to the current model might be more accurate.

The first process of the giant Hadron Harvester found no previously unknown particles other than the Higgs boson that were thought to exist as part of the Standard Model and so there is no evidence for supersymmetry. Indirect methods include research at an electrical dwikutub moment (electric polished moment or permanent EDM), which can arise when standard model particles interact with supersymmetric particles.

These discoveries have disappointed many physicists, which are believed that supersymmetry (and other theories are counting on it) so far the most promising theories for \"new\" physics, and hoping for signs of unexpected results of this process. Former advocate Mikhail Shifman stepped away by encouraging a theoretical community to come up with a new idea and accept that supersymmetry is a failed theory.

There's a lot of phenomenological motivation for supersymmetry close to the electro-weak scale, as well as technically motivated-motive for supersymmetry on each scale. A supersymmetry close to the electroweak scale fixes the hierarchy problem that overrides the Standard Model. In the Standard Model, the electroweak scale accepts the quantum correction of Planck's enormous scale. The hierarchy observed between the electroweak scale and the scale of Planck must be achieved by a remarkable suiting.

The most simple possible supesymmetric model consistent with the Standard Model is the Minimum Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) which can include the required number of new particles that are able to be superpartner of them in the Standard Model one of the main motivations for SUSI comes from a squarely different contribution to the Higgs mass square. Quantum mechanics interactions of the Higgs boron cause a massive renormalization of the Higgs mass and unless there is an accidental cancellation, the natural size of the Higgs mass is the largest scale possible. This problem is known as a hierarchy problem. Supersymmetry reduces the size of quantum matches by having an automatic cancellation between fermionic interaction and Higgs bosonic. If supersymmetry is recovering on a weak scale, then the Higgs mass is related to a change in supersymmetry that can be induced from a small non-disruption effect explains a very different scale of weak interactions and gravitational interactions.

Anthropology is derived from the Greek word \"man\" (in the sense of \"calculable\") or \"human\" or \"people\" and logos which means \"badness,\" or etymologically anthropology means science that studies people. In doing human studies, anthropology puts two key concepts: Holistic and Compotive. So anthropology studies are very concerned with aspects of history and a thorough explanation to describe humans through the knowledge of social science, as well as humanities. Anthropology aims to better understand and appreciate man as the biological entity of homo sapiens and social beings in an interdisciplined and comprehensive framework. Thus, anthropology uses the theory of biological evolution in giving historical meaning and fact in explaining the course of mankind on earth from the beginning of its appearance. Anthropology also uses cross-cultural studies to emphasize and explain the difference between human groups in the perspective of cultural material, social behavior, language, and the view of life. With its holistic orientation, anthropology is divided into four interconnected branches of science, namely: Biology anthropology, Social Anthropology, Archaeology, and Linguistics. The four branches have their own concentration studies in academic specialty and scientific research, with unique topics and different methods of research. Anthropology was born or started with the interest of Europeans in physical traits, customs, and other ethnic cultures that were different from those known in Europe. At the time anthropological studies were more focused on the population of a single society, single in the sense of the unity of the community living in a common geographical region, having similar physical and language characteristics, and the same way of living. Yet in its development, anthropology then ceases to be a mere study of the single human group that inhabits a similar geographical region.",

Anthropology is built on knowledge of nature, including the discovery of Homo sapiens origins and evolution, the physical characteristics of humans, human behavior, variations among human groups, how Homo sapiens evolution has affected social organizations and cultures. As well as from social sciences, anthropology teaches organizations social and cultural relationships, genetic systems and kinship, spirituality and reliability, institutions, social conflicts, etc. Early anthropology came from classical and Persian Greeks who studied and tried to understand observable cultural diversity.

In practice there is no significant difference between social anthropology and cultural anthropology, and it even overlaps between the two. An anthropological philosophy used to be known as a psychological philosophy that can be interpreted as a philosophical discipline that developed in about the 18th century in order to prove ideas or thoughts about the capacity of conceptual thought, free will and spiritual soul. This philosophy is the development of rational psychology that was pioneered by Christian von Wolff. Psychology is a science that studies metaphysical theories of the mind and the soul and is able to explain the relatively limited psychology of empiricals only on observed souls or observation alone. As for some natural sciences that influence psychological studies about the soul but keep it away from questions related to metaphysical theories. A lot of criticism that emerges from psychological philosophy comes from Kant who argues that the awareness of the thinking individual is not the state of reality. Individuals cannot achieve their own identity just by doing the process of thinking but having to dig from themselves through introspection as of the theories of psychological philosophy, we must also observe the human side, including history, literature, and culture of other nations.

The study of psychological anthropology related to psychological phenomena by using character terms is not particularly interested in researchers, while the most common occurrences in research are personality terms, or in generic concepts are referred to as culture and personality. Both terms still lead to human psychological conditions where characters can be compared to personality terms and can be said that characters are drawn from individual personalities. In understanding character phenomena in an individual society must look from a psychological anthropology standpoint. The process of forming and developing the character of a society focuses on the development and psychological conditions of humans living in that society and the experience of individuals and social environments into a series of processes that contribute to the character formation itself. Psychological anthropology serves as a link between the study of culture and personality in explaining a group of people or national tribes. The study of character in society in anthropology studies is put into psych anthropology studies by focusing on the main concept, which is personality. The formation of a society's character is in the cultural context of a society that can touch the personality but depend heavily on the learning process in individual behavior (learned behaviors) that support that culture. A factor that affects anthropology from a psychological anthropology standpoint is that individuals can choose their own culture when the psychological dimension conforms to that culture.

In cases of identity crisis individuals have not only had psychological impact but also had an impact on their social behavior. As a result, there are obstacles to social relations that generally engage in broader social relationships, individuals will find it difficult to blend into the social structure that is in society. In psychosomatic models of approach in the psychological flow, disease will develop to follow a physical and mental relationship that strengthens each other through a mutual system. Psychosomatics are demonstrated by the relationship of the soul and the body, so psychological processes play a vital role. Psychological aspects such as unsound belief and thinking patterns will affect the emergence of various physical diseases. The approach is often referred to as a biopsychosocial approach, which is a concept that explains that there are interactions between biological, psychological, and social conditions to understand individual diseases and pain processes. Sick conditions are not caused only by biological factors, but they are also the psychological and social factors that exist around individuals such as family and community groups. In anthropology, there is one focus on the study of communication behavior, particularly communication ethnography, which is defined as behaviors that form three integration skills that each individual has as a social being, which are linguistic skills, interaction skills, and cultural skills.

In this phase, these ethnography materials have been composed into pieces based on the evolution of society at the time. societies and cultures evolved slowly and over a long period of time. They considered the nations other than Europe as the primitive nations that were left behind, and considered Europe to be a high-cultural nation at this stage, academic purpose antology and began to grow as contemporary studies of the human race, anatomy, history of human settlements, language classification and comparison between primitive and ancient societies. They studied primitive societies and cultures with the intention of gaining an understanding of the historical levels of the spread of human culture. In this phase, European countries are racing to build colonies on other continents like Asia, America, Australia and Africa. In order to build these colonies, there were such obstacles as attacks from the natives, rebellions, weather that was not appropriate for the Europeans and other obstacles. In the face of it, the colonial government of the European state sought to find the weakness of the natives to then conquer it. That's why they started studying ethnography materials about tribes outside Europe, studying their culture and customs, for the benefit of colonial governments. At this stage, anthropology is growing rapidly. The culture of the native tribes that occupied Europe began to disappear as a result of European culture.

But many societies still hold grudges against Europeans that have invaded them for years. These changes led to the attention of anthropology no longer to rural peoples outside Europe, but also to peoples in rural Europe such as Soami, Flam and Lapp. Before World War II, anthropology in Indonesia was widely conducted by Dutch scholars in universities or other institutions. Some of the works produced are customary legal research by C. van Vollenhoven and J. Prins and the development of Indonesian anthropology by R. Kennedy, G.J. Held, A.G.

This in turn included semantic studies (means summarized from words and concepts) and pragmatics (means summarized from context). There is a system of rules (known as grammar) that regulates communication between members of a certain speech society. The grammar is influenced by sound and meaning, including morphology, syntax, and phrase composition and sentences of these words, and phonology. Through the linguistics of the corpus, large pieces of text can be analyzed for possible linguistics and style patterns in written or oral discourse. Linguistics evolved in harmony with the complexity of objects or studied matter.",

It's what makes linguistics rich in branches of science that each concentrate on the kind of approach to studies and objects that are studied. Among these linguistic branches are the following: Linguistics has some aspects of phonology, morphology, aspects of syntax, aspects of semantics, and aspects of pragmatics. The basic principle of linguistic humanistics is that language is an invention created by humans. A semiotic tradition of linguistic research considers language to be a sign system that emerges from the interaction of meaning and shape. Language structure organizations are considered computational. Linguistics are basically viewed as related to social and cultural sciences because different languages are formed in social interactions by speech societies. The skeleton that represents the humanistic view of language including structural linguistics, among other things. Structural analysis means dissecting each layer: phonetic, morphological, syntax, and discourse, to the smallest units. This is collected into inventory (e.g. phonem, morfem, lexical class, phrase type) to study their connections in structure and layer hierarchy. A functional analysis adds structural analysis of assigned role semantics and other functional roles that each unit may have. For example, nouns can serve as subjects of grammar or sentence objects, or as semantics or patients. A functional Linguistic, or functional grammar, is a structurally linguistic branch. In the context of humanistics, the terms structuralism and functionalism are associated with its meaning in other human sciences. The difference between formal and functional structuralism lies in their answer to the question of why language has the qualities it possesses. A functional explanation requires the idea that language is a tool for communication, or that communication is a major function of language.",

Some Scandinavian sagas wrote a campaign of retaliation against Estonia. Estonian hijackers are running an invasion against Vikings. The pagan pirates that raided the small town of Sigtuna (now including Sweden) at the beginning of the Middle Ages, in 1187, were Estonians.

The province is made up of some village or region. Almost all provinces have at least one fort. Local defenses are led by high-ranking officers, kings or elders.

In the late 1980s, Estonians viewed their demographic change as a national disaster. This is the result of an important migration policy for the Soviet Nationalization Program that aims to squander Estonian military and administrative immigration of non-Estonia from the Soviet Union, coupled with the mass expulsion of Estonians into the Soviet Union. During cleaning, up to 110,000 Estonians were killed or expelled. In the next decade (after the restoration of independence), the massive ethnic emigration of Russia and the removal of Russian military bases in 1994 caused Estonian ethnic proportions in Estonia to rise from 61% to 69% in 2006. Modern Estonia is a pretty heterogenous country seen by its ethnic composition, but it's not a common feature, because non-Estonia's population is centered in two counties. Thirteen of the 15 county Estonians accommodated 80 percent of Estonian ethnically, the most homogenous was Hiiuma, where Estonian ethnicity was 98.4% of the population.

In 825, he completed the construction of the Borobudur temple that became the pride of Indonesia. To strengthen the alliance between Shailendra's money and the former ruler of Sriwijaya, Samartapok married Goddess Tara, daughter of Dharmasetu. From that marriage Samaratutok had a son heir to the throne, Balanja god, and Pramodhawardhani who married Rakai Piratang, son of Sri Maharaja Rakai Garung, king of the five Kingdoms. The Samaratutok's name is found in an inscription on May 26, 824. The inscription says that Samaratutok had a daughter named Pramodawardhani who inaugurated a very beautiful jinalaya. This inscription is thought to be related to the construction of the Borobudur temple. Woodplant inscriptions are made up of two parts. The first part of Sanskrit was mentioned as above, while the second part of ancient Javanese was issued by Rakai Patratan Mpu Palar.

Then in 832 he built his own empire and used the Maharajah of Rakai Garung. His son Rakai Piratan Mpu Manuku married Pramodawardhani's daughter Samaratungo so that he could inherit the throne of the Royal Court. De Casparis' theory was rejected by Slamet Muljana. According to him, the Gondosul inscription was removed when Mpu Palar died. His final title according to the inscription was the hajj, the title for the king under the maharajah. So Haji Rakai Patapan can't be the same as the Maharajah Rakai Garung. It is also said that the children of Mpu Palar are all women, so it is not possible for him to be the son of Rakai Piranang. Reviewed from the grammar of the Gondosuli inscription, the Mpu Palar character is thought to be from the island of Sumatra. The Munduan inscription known as Rakai Patapan in 807 was Mpu Manuku. Then on the inscription of the Woodplant (8) was associated with Mpu Palar. However, on the inscription of the Air Bones (8) Manuku Mpu is again leading the Pataan area. The conclusion is, Mpu Manuku first served as Rakai Patapan. He said: O Musa! surely my Lord is with me and with you; surely He is the Hearing, the Knowing. For his services and loyalty, Mpu Palar was then appointed king under the title of hajj or hajj. Rakai Piratan Mpu Manuku managed to marry Pramodawardhani the Crown Princess.

According to the inscription of Mantyasi, the Maharajah Rakai Garung ruled the kingdom before Rakai Pirating. Thus, the character who may be identical to her is the Maharaja of Samaratungo, not the Mpu Palar that has only the hajj title. According to this theory, then, before becoming king in the Kingdom of Medang, Samaratutang first served as head of Garrung (Kirryan i Garung or Rakai Garung). According to Nalanda's Prassisti, Balason god is the king of S colordwipe (Kingship of Sriwijaya) and son of Samarragrawira. Based on the likeness of the name, De Casparis likens this Samaratutok to Samaratuga, which is then popularized by other historians, such as Dr. Bosch. This theory considers that after Samaratutang's death, civil war was fought over the throne between Balason god against Rakai Piratara, his sister's husband, Pramodawardhani. The defeated son of a god then move away to Sumatra. Slamet Muljana rejects Samaratungo's identification with Samarragrawira. He argued that the Wood Rassti mentioned that Samaratutok had only a daughter, Pramidawardhani. According to Slamet Muljana, Balason god had no right to the throne of Java because he was Samaratutang's brother, not his son. In other words, Shamragrawira was the father of two sons, Samaratutang and Balaan god. Perhaps it was because of the defeat of war that Balanad god departed to Sumatra, but because he did not have the right to the throne of Java. Balason god's stronghold in the battle against Rakai Piranang is thought to be on Queen Boko's Hill.

The reservation of Borobudur's temple was thought to have occurred in 824 and was carried out by Pramodwardhani the crown princess. This year Samaratutokang is certain to be alive. Then, the 842 Kahulunan inscription mentions a Sri Kahulunan character who has set some villages up as a nursery area to care for Bhumisambhara's Kadi Boropur. There are two versions of this Sri Kahulunan character, the Empress or the Queen Mother. Samaratutok's name is not mentioned in the inscription, so he is thought to be dead. It was estimated at the time of the reign of Rakai Piranang. If Sri Kahulunan means the Empress, then he is Pramodawardhani. As for the meaning of a suri mother, she is the queen of Samaratutang. So in conclusion, the Samaratutokian government is estimated to have occurred before 819 and ended before 842. It starts with a religious distinction between a Buddhist ruler and a lay community who embraces the Hindu Shiwa religion. This was a factor in instability in Central Java.

Meanwhile, historians like Poerbatatara and Boechari believed that there was only one money, Shailendra, and never mentioned Sanjayavam\u00e7a in any inscription. Sanjaya and her descendants are considered still in Shailendra's money. Traditionally, during the reign of Shailendra was thought to last between the 8th and 9th centuries A.D., and only limited in Central Java, just in the Plains of Kedu, from a time of breeding to Samaratutangang. This is in accordance with the interpretation of Slamet Muljana, who considered Panangran to be the first king of Shailendra to ascend the throne. But the most advanced interpretation based on Sojomerto's inventions and the continuation of Syailendra in Sriwijaya suggested; that the era of power of Shailendra's money lasted much longer. From the middle of the 7th century, to the early 11th century, (the fall of Shailendra's money in Sriwijaya as a result of a Cholamdula attack from India). Over a period of time, Shailendra's money ruled both Central Java and Sumatra. The alliance and marriage of the royal family between Sriwijaya and Shailendra made it possible to join two royal families, with Shailendra's money finally ruling well in the Central Java Cutout Kingdom at once in Sriwijaya, Sumatra. Historians have tried to reconstruct the genealogical order of Shailendra's kings; although one another may not agree. For example, Slamet Muljana, continuing the theory of the Bosch twin dynasty, argues that the first member of the Shailendra moneyma to succeed in being king was Rakai Panraran. Meanwhile, Poerbatatara argues that Sanjaya's money never existed.",

In normal sleep, motor functions are usually also sensory nerve for activities that require coordination with the central nervous system will be blocked, so sleep tends to be motionless and response is reduced. The phase of transition from conscious to sleep is referred to as pradormitium and the phase of transition from sleep back to consciousness is referred to as postdormitium. In medicine the study of sleep disorders is referred to as somnologies. In the animal kingdom, sleep is common. Even so, it's not universal. Land animals, for example, sleep with their eyes closed, while marine animals cannot be 100 percent proven, although many claim that they also sleep. Dolphins or whales even snore. Dolphins, for example, sleep with just one part of the brain or the hemisphere, as it is due to the adjustments in the needs of a dolphin breathing underwater. That's why dolphins don't go through REM sleep phases. Other examples include sea lions and seals; they can sleep both on land and in the sea. If on land they experience the same sleep phase as humans, if at sea they experience the same sleep phase as dolphins. Nowadays, all spineless animals (exactly jawboned) are believed to be experiencing the same sleep phase as humans (exception: echidna).

Radon can trigger lung cancer and has caused 20,000 deaths in the European Union every year. Radon does not react chemically easily, but is radioactive. Radon is a gas with a 9.73 g/L high density (the worst gas at temperature and pressure is wolfram hexafloride, WF6, with a density of 13 g/L). At temperature and pressure of space, the radon is colorless but when cooled to freezing, the radon will be yellow, while the liquid radon will be pink. The natural buildup of radon gas in the earth's atmosphere is so slowly that the water that touches the free air continues to lose radon because of the process of \u25aaVolatilization. Underground water has a radon content higher than surface water. Radon is sometimes used by some hospitals for therapeutic purposes. The Radon was obtained by pumping from the source of Radium and was stored in a small tube called \u25aaBeh the Esquipment or \u25aajarum. Radon is rarely used anymore, but given the hospital's now being able to get seeds from \u25aasuppliers that produce seeds with the desired rate of decay. It is usually used by cobalts and caesiums that last for several years, making it more practical to view them in logistical terms.

Mutations at the gene level are called dot mutations, whereas mutations in chromosomes are usually called aberrations. The mutation in genes can lead to the emergence of new alleles and to the basis of new variations in species. Mutations occur at low frequencies in nature, usually lower than 1:10,000 individuals. Natural mutations can be attributed to mutation plants (mutagens, including carcinogens), solar radiation, radioactive radiation, ultraviolet light, X - rays, and lightning surges like lightning. Individuals who display the change in character (fenotipe) resulting from mutations are called mutants. In genetic studies, mutants are common compared to individuals who don't experience changes in character (wild type or \"wild type\"). Mutation point is a change in N base from DNA or RNA. Relative point mutations often occur but the effect can be reduced by gene recovery mechanisms. Point mutations can result in a change in the amino acid sequence of proteins, and can result in a decrease, change or loss of enzyme function. The current technology uses dot mutations as a marker (called SNP) to review the changes that occur in genes and are associated with the changes in phenotypes that occur. The sample of gene mutations is a nitritic acid reaction with adenine into a hypoxanthine substance. This substance will occupy the original adenine place and pair it with cytosine, not with thymine. The mutation of chromosomes, often referred to as large mutations or chromosomes, is the change in the number of chromosomes and the sequence or sequence of genes in chromosomes. The mutation of chromosomes is often due to meiosis errors and a little bit in mitosis. Euploidi is the change in number n. In this case, \"n\" signifies the number of chromosomal sets. For example, the human cell has 2 chromosomes so it's called 2n, where a human n package is 23 chromosomes.",

In autopoliploidi, the n is self-inflicted because of a meiosis error, whereas the allopoliploidi, which is marriage or hybrid between different species, is the number of chromosomes. Aneusomi is a change in the number of chromosomes. The cause is anaphase lag and non disjunction. Aneusomi in humans can cause: it happens when a chromosome fragment is broken and lost during cell division. The chromosomes where the fragments come from will then lose certain genes. But in some cases, those fragment fractures can bond with homologous chromosomes produce duplicates. It can also attach itself back to its original chromosome in reverse direction and produce inversion. The ingredients that cause mutations are called mutagens. Mutagen is divided into three meanings: In general, mutations are harmful, the mutants are letting and the homozygote are recessive. But mutations are also profitable, among them, through mutations, to create superior polyploid plants. For example, watermelons without seeds, oranges without seeds, large strawberries, etcetera. This mutation is also one of the key to evolution in this world. The formation of polyploid plants benefits humans, but it harms vegetation that are mutated, since it becomes geneatively unproducing. Although biologically most of the mutations cause disturbances in individual fitness, even death, mutation is actually one of the key to the adaptability of a type (species) to a new or changing environment. This positive side is used by a number of applied biological fields.

The term is derived from the Greek: thithos, meaning \"rock.\" It's a soft, white alkaline metal. Under standard conditions, it is both the lightest metal and the lightest solid element. Like all alkali metals, lithium is highly reactive and flammable, and it is stored in mineral oil. When it was cut so that its interior was open, it showed a lump of metal, but the damp air stained it quickly into a grayish dull, then formed a black stain. Litium was never found as a free element in nature, but only as a compound (usually ionic), like a petitat mineral that used to be the main source of lithium. It is present in seawater and is usually obtained from salt water, as it is dissolved as an ion. The lithium metal is electrolysed electrolyzed from the mixture of chloride lithium and potassium chloride. The atomic nucleus of lithium vibrates at instability, because the two stable isotop lithium found in nature has the lowest bond energy per nucleon of all stable nuclides. Litium is less abundant in the solar system than 25 elements of the first 32 chemical elements, although the nucleus is very light, due to relative nuclear instability: this is the exception of the trend that the more nuclear weight, the smaller the abundance. According to that reason, lithium has an important use in nuclear physics. The transmutation of lithium atoms into helium in 1932 was the first man - made nuclear reaction, and lithium-6 deuteride served as fusion fuel in the exhibited thermonuclear weapons.

Litium has been detected in human organs and fetal tissue since the late 19th century, triggering speculation about its specific function. After the next century, experimental evidence was obtained. In studies in the 1970s, rats and goats with low - lithium diets had higher mortality, as well as reproductive and behavioral disorders. In humans no lithium deficiencies are defined, but low intake of lithium from water supplies is associated with increased suicide rates, murder and arrest rates for drug use and other crimes. The high lithium content in the early embryos shows an important role during the development of the fetus. The biochemical mechanism of lithium action seems to be linked to many factors and correlates with the function of some enzymes, hormones and vitamins, as well as growth and transformation factors. The current evidence seems enough to accept lithium as essential; the temporary AKG for 70 kilograms of adults is recommended 1,000 \u25aag/day. Litium salts have proved useful as mood medicine in treatment of bipolar disorder in humans. Like other alkaline metals, lithium has a single valence electron that's easily released to form the cluster. Hence, lithium is a good hot and electric element and is highly reactive, although it is the least reactive among the alkali metals. The low reactivity of lithium is because of its close valence electron with its nucleus (two remaining electrons are in the 1s orbital, its energy is much lower, and does not participate in chemical bonds).",

Litium has very low density (0,534 g/cm3), comparable to pine wood. It has the smallest density of all solid elements at room temperature; the next solid element (potassium, at 0.862 g/cm3) is over 60% denser. Next, besides helium and hydrogen, the density is smaller than any liquid element, only two thirds of liquid nitrogen density (0.808 g/cm3). Litium can float on the lightest hydrocarbon oil and is one of three metals that can float in water, the other two are sodium and potassium. Litium thermal expansion coefficient doubles aluminum and almost four times iron. Litium is a superconductor below 400 \u25aaK at standard pressure and at higher temperatures (more than 9 K) at very high pressure (>20 GPa). At temperatures below 70 K, lithium, like sodium, experiences a transformation of the phase of nirfus phase.

In damp air lithium quickly becomes a black layer of lithium hydroxide (LioH and LiOH\u00b7H2O), lithium nitride (Li3N) and lithium carbonate (Li2CO3, the result of the secondary reaction between LiOH and CO2). When placed on flame, the lithium compound gives a red glow of creamson, but when it burns hard, the flame becomes brilliant silver. Litium will ignite and burn in oxygen when exposed to water or water vapor. Litium is flammable, and potentially explosive when exposed to air and especially water, although its potential is less than any other alkaline metal.

Although it was one of the first three elements synthesized in the Big Bang, lithium, along with beryllium and boron are actually less abundant than any other element.

Brande also explains some pure salts of lithium, such as chloride, and, predicting that lithia (lithium oxide) contains a metal of about 55%, estimates the atomic weight of lithium at the range of 9.8 g/mol (the modern value of ~6.94 g/mol). In 1855 a greater number of lithiums was produced through lythium chloride electrolysis by Robert Bunsen and Augustus Matthiessen. The discovery of this procedure led to commercial lithium production in 1923 by the German company Metallgellschaft AG, which conducts an electrolysis mixture of liquid chloride lithium and potassium chloride.

The United States became a major producer of lithium in the period between the late 1950s and the mid 1980s.

The production of lithium has increased rapidly since the end of World War II. The metal is separated from other elements in frozen minerals. Litium metals are generated through electrolysis from a 55% lithium chloride mixture and 45% potassium chloride at about 450 \u00b0C temperatures. Per 2015, most of the world's lithium production is in South America, where salt water containing lithium is extracted from underground pools and rounded up with sunbathing. Standard extraction techniques are evaporating water from salt water. Each battle takes 18 to 24 months. In 1998, the price of lithium was about 95 dollars/kg (or 43 USD/lb). The reserve identified worldwide in 2008 according to U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) was 13 million tons, although accurate estimates of the world's lithium reserves were difficult. Deposit was found in South America along the Andes mountain chain. Chile is the largest producer, followed by Argentina. Both countries get lithium from saltwater pools. According to the USGS, Bolivia's Uyuni Desert has 5.4 million tons of lithium reserves. In the United States, lithium is obtained from a saltwater pool in Nevada. However, half the world's known reserves are in Bolivia along the east slopes of the Andes mountains. In 2009, Bolivia negotiated with Japanese, French, and Korean companies to start extraction.

Mammal Theria took over a medium - to - large ecological shaft in the Senozoicum, after the extinction of the Kapur BartholomewPaleogen about 66 million years ago emptied the ecological space once filled with nonunggas and other reptile groups, as well as other groups of mammals, and then experienced an exponential increase in body size (megafauna). Mammals are then diversified very quickly; both birds and mammals indicate an exponential increase in diversity. For example, the earliest known bats originated some 50 million years ago, only 16 million years after the extinction of nonunggas dinosaurs. Molecular philogenetic studies originally showed that most of the placenalia order branched some 100 to 85 million years ago and that modern families appeared during the late Eosen period to Miosen. However, no placenalia fossil was found before the end of the Kapur period. The earliest irrefutable fossil plasentalia came from the early Paleosen, after the extinction of nonunggas dinosaurs. In particular, scientists have identified the early Paleosen animal named Protungulatum donnae as one of the first plasental mammals. However, this animal has been classified as a nonclassentian Eutheria. Recalibration in the genetic and morphological diversity levels indicates the Final Chalk period for Paleosen plasentalia for most modern klads.",

This little primate weighs about 30 ounces (0.71.1.1.1 ounces) and can fit in the palm of a human hand. Living mammal species can be identified by sweat glands, including glands that are specialize in producing milk to feed their young. In classifying fossils, other characteristics must be used because soft tissue glands and many other characteristics are invisible in fossils. Many of the characteristics that all living mammals have, including those of the earliest mammals, such as: for most of the cases, these characteristics don't exist in mammal ancestors in the Trias Period. Almost all mammals have epipubis bone, except for a modern - day plasentian mammal. In general, male mammals are larger than females. Most ordos in mammals also show malely biased sexual dymorphism, although some orders do not indicate any bias or significant female bias (Lagomorpha). The differences in body size of male and female animals will increase as males grow in size (Rensch rules), indicating that there is parallel selection pressure at the size of male and female bodies. Malely biased dymorphism has to do with sexual selection in male animals, that is, through competition between males to get females. There is a positive correlation between the level of sexual selection, indicated by the marital system, with a malely biased demorphistic level. Parallel selection pressure in female body mass is also identified, that the age of harvesting is significantly higher in more polyginim species, even when body mass has been corrected. In addition, ever lower reproductive levels in larger females indicate that fekundity selection chooses smaller females.",

Its exception was the sea bull and a two - nailed sloth that had six neckbones and a three - nailed sloth that had nine neckbones. All mammal brains have neocortexes, areas of the brain unique to mammals. Plasental mammal brains have corpus causum, unlike monotremata and marsupials. The mammals' lungs are like sponges and beehives. Respiration is powered by diaphragm, which separates the chest cavity from the stomach cavity and forms a convex dome to the chest. Contractions of diaphragm will level the dome so it increases the volume of the pulmonary cavity. The air enters through the oral and nose cavity, then runs through larynx, trachea, then bronchus, and expands the alveolus. Relatation of diaphragm has the opposite effect, reducing the volume of the lung cavity so that air is pushed out of the lungs. When mammals act physically, the wall of the stomach contractes and increases the pressure on the diaphragm, which forces the air out faster and stronger. The rib cage is able to expand and deflate through the actions of other breathing muscles. As a result, air is sucked in or removed from the lungs, always following its pressure gradient. Because of its resemblance to the ubub, this type of lung is known as the ubub lung. The mammal's heart has four chambers, which are the two upper atriums as the receivers and the two lower rooms as the expense chamber. The heart has four valves that separate the ventricles and ensure that blood flows in the right direction. After a gas exchange in the pulmonary capillary, oxygen-rich blood returns to the left atrium through one of the four pulmonary veins.",

        "paragraph": "Blood flows almost continuously back into the atrium, which acts as a receiver's chamber, and from here blood flows through the hole into the left ventricle. Most of the blood flows passively to the heart when the atrium and the ventricle are executed, but toward the end of the diastol, the left atrium will contract and pump blood into the ventricle. Like other muscles, the heart also needs nutrients and oxygen found in the blood, and it is supplied by the coroner's artery. The integument system consists of three layers: epidermis, dermis, and hypodermis. Epidermic thickness is usually 10 to 30 cells; its main function is to provide a waterproof coating. The outer cells are constantly missing, while the lower cells keep splitting and pushing upwards. Middle layer, dermis, 15 to 40 times thicker than epidermis. Dermis consists of many components, such as bone structure and blood vessels. Hypodermis is made up of adiposa network, which stores lipids and provides pads and insulations. The thickness of this layer varies greatly from one species to another; marine mammals need thick hypodermism for insulation, and the brush whale has the thickest fat (20 inches or 51 cm). Although other animals have such features as misai, fur, seta, or silia, there are no animals other than mammals with hair. It's a definitive characteristic of mammal class, although some mammals have very few hairs. Herbivor has developed a variety of physical structures to facilitate their consuming plants. To break apart the whole tissue of plants, mammals have developed tooth structure that reflects their eating preference. For example, flovor and herbivor eating soft leaves have low - crowned teeth especially for grinding leaves and seeds.",

Most carnivorous mammals have basal teeth (which vary in length depending on food), long fangs, and similar dental replacement patterns. Even animal hulls (Artiodactyla) are divided into four sections: rummen, reticulum, omasum, and abomum (only ruminansia have rummen). Once plant material is swallowed, they are mixed with saliva in the rumen and reticulum, and then they are separated into solid, liquid material. The solids merge to form bolus (or mamaan) and then are regurgitated. When the bollus entered the mouth, it was squeezed with the tongue and swallowed again. Diets digested into the rumen and reticulum, where cellulolitic microorganisms (bacterial, protozoa, and fungi) produce cellulase, enzymes necessary to break cellulose into plants. Unlike ruminansia, oddly steamed animals (Perissodactyla) store digested foods and have left their entrails in large segments, where the food is fermented by bacteria. Compared with herbivor's complex digestive system, Carnivore has a simple stomach that adapts primarily to digest the flesh. Their clusters are not there or are short and simple, and their colons are not pocketed or much wider than the small intestines. The mammal excretion system involves many components. Like most land animals, mammals are ureotelic, turning ammonia into urea in the liver as part of the urea cycle. Bilirubin, waste products produced by blood cells brought through bile and urine with the help of enzymes produced by the liver. Crossing the bilirubin via bile to the intestines makes mammal waste brown.",

Only mammals have nutlike kidneys, although there are several variations, such as many reticular kidneys in seals, setasea, and bears. Most grown mammals have no chlorican remains at all. In embryos, embryonic chloraka divides into posterior parts that form anus and anterior parts that form different structures, depending on the individual gender: in females, this part becomes a vestibula that forms uretra and vagina, whereas in the male, it forms the entire uretra kavernosa. Nevertheless, Tenrecidae, Chrysochloridae, and a number of centranks maintain chloraka in adulthood. The marsupial genital tract is separated from the anus, but the rest of the original chloraka remains on the outside of the body. Monotremata, derived from the Greek word \"single hole,\" has the true chloraka. Like all the other tetrapods, mammals have larynx that can open and close quickly to produce sound, as well as a supralaringeal vocal channel that filters this sound. The surrounding lungs and muscles provide the air flow and pressure needed to phone. The larynx controls high tones and volumes of sound, but the power of the lungs to exhale also contributes to the volume of sound. More primitive mammals, such as an anthog, can only hiss because its voice is obtained only by breathing through a partially sealed larynx. Other mammals are phoned with vocal cords. The movement or tension of the vocal cords can produce many sounds such as snoring and screaming. Mammals can change the position of larynx, which enables them to breathe through their noses and swallow through their mouths, as well as to form the sound of their mouths and the sound of their noses; the sound of their noses, such as the whining of dogs, is usually soft, whereas the sound of their mouths, such as the barking of dogs, is usually loud.",

Large vocal pads can also lower tones, such as in a large low - pitched roar. Infrasonic production is possible in some mammals like African elephants (Loxodonta spp.) And a balin whale. Small mammals with small larynx have the ability to produce ultrasonics, which can be detected by modifications to middle ears and cochlea. Ultrasonics were not heard by birds and reptiles, which may have been important during the Mesozoic Era, when birds and reptiles became dominant predators. This personal sound channel is used by some rodents, for example, mother-to-child communication, and by bats while performing ecolocation. The toothed whale also uses an echolocation using a melon that works differently. Some primates have air sacs attached to larynx and can function to lower resonance or increase sound volume. The vocal production system is controlled by the cranial nerve nucleus in the brain and supplied by the recurren larynx nerve and the superior larynx nerve, which is a branch of the vagus nerve. The vocal system is supplied by hypoglossus nerves and facial nerve. The electrical stimulation of the periaqueductal gray region (PEG) of the mammal's central brain generates vocalization. The ability to study new vocalizations is only exemplified in humans, seals, seceasea, elephants, and perhaps bats; in humans, this ability is the result of a direct relationship between the motor cortex that controls the motion and motor neurons in the spinal cord. The main function of mammals' hair is compromised. Another function is protection, sensory, antiair, and camouflage. There are different kinds of hairs that each have a different purpose: Hair length is not a determining factor in musing: for example, some tropical mammals such as sloths have the same length as some Arctic mammals, but with fewer insulations; otherwise, other tropical mammals with short hairs have the same insulated value as Arctic mammals.",

Some desert mammals, such as camels, use heavy hair to prevent the sun's heat from reaching their skin so that they remain cool; the temperature of the camel's hair can reach 70 \u00b0C (158 \u00b0F) in the summer, but its skin remains at 40 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F). On the contrary. Aumatic mammals trap air in their hair to protect the heat by keeping the skin dry. A mammal's coat has a variety of colors for various reasons. The principal selective pressure of camouflage, sexual selection, communication, and computing. The color of mammals' hair and skin is primarily determined by the variety and number of melanin; the eumelanin for brown and black, and the feomelanine for various colors of yellowness to rosy, thus giving mammals the color of soil. Some mammals have a brighter color; a shaman monkey has a bright blue ridge in its muzzle that is produced by facial collagen fiber diffraction. Many sloths appear to be green because their hair contains green algae, which may be a symbiotic relationship that gives camouflage to sloths. Camouflage exerts a powerful influence on a large number of mammals because it helps hide individuals from predators or predators. In Arctic and subarctic mammals such as the Arctic fox (Alopex lagopus), lemmings collared (Dicrostyx groenlandicus), shorttails (Mustela erminea), and snowshoes (Lepus americans), the change in color between summer and white in the winter is largely driven by camouflage.",

Apocematism, or warning predators, is the most likely explanation of the black-and-white hair of many mammals capable of self-defense, as in the foul-smelling skunks and a strong, aggressive racetel. Color coats are sometimes sexually morphed, as in many primate species. The differences in the color of male and female coats can indicate the level of nutrients and hormones, which is important in the selection of couples. The color of the coat can affect the ability to withstand heat, depending on how much light is reflected. Mammals with darker coats can absorb more heat from the sun's radiation, and keep it warm, while some smaller mammals, such as voles, have darker hair in winter. The white, unpigmented hair of Arctic mammals, such as polar bears, may reflect more solar radiation directly into the skin. The enchanting black-and-white line on the zebra seems to provide protection from the fly's bite. Mammals are completely gonocoric. In male plasentalia, penises are used for urinating and copulation. Depending on its species, an erection can be triggered by blood flow into a vascular sponge tissue or by muscle action. Penis may be in the mouth when they don't have an erection, and some placentals also have the bone of a penis. Marsupials usually have a branched penis, while the ecidna's penis generally has four heads, but only two function.

The reproductive condition of the ancestral mammal is giving birth to a relatively undeveloped child, either through immediate vivipar or in no time as a soft shelled egg. This means of reproduction is likely to occur because their stems cannot expand because of the epipubis bone. This reproductive style was first shown by the genus Kayentatherium, which produces an undeveloped periodata, but with a number of children far more than any modern mammal, that is, 38 specimens. Most modern mammals are vivipar, giving birth to children. However, five species of monotremata, platypus, and four species of ecidna, reproduce by laying eggs. Monotremies have different gender determination systems than most other mammals. In particular, the sex chromosome platypus is more like a chicken than a Theria mammal. Mammals vivipar are in the subclass of Theria; they're still alive right now in an infrared class of Marsupial and Placentalia. Marsupials have a short gestation period, usually shorter than their estrus cycle and give birth to an undeveloped newborn and then experience further development; in many species this development occurs within the pouch located in the front of the mother's stomach.",

Even nonplasenta Eutheria may reproduce this way. Plasentalia give birth to a relatively complete and growing baby, usually after a long gestation period. This group gets its name from the placenta, a structure that connects the developing fetus to the cervix to allow nutrients to be absorbed. In a plastic mammal, the epipubis bone is completely lost or converted into a baculum. This enables the stem to develop so that the fetus is born in a developing condition. The mammal's milk gland is specialized to produce milk, a major source of nutrients for newborns. Monotremies branch earlier than other mammals so as not to have nipples as most mammals do, but they still have milk glands. The young mammals lick milk from the breast that lies in the belly of their mothers. Compared with plastic mammals, bag milk is very different, both at the rate of production and in the composition of nutrients, since their babies are born with a condition that has not yet been fully developed. In addition, milk glands have more autonomy that allows them to supply milk separately for babies at different stages of development. Lactose is the main sugar in the milk of the plasented mammals, while monotremata and tungs are dominated by the oigososokaride. Precipitation is a process when mammals become less dependent on their mother's milk and more dependent on solid food. Almost all mammals are endethermic.

Birds are also endethermic, so the endetherm is not a special trait of mammals. Among mammals, the maximum lifespan of species vary (e. g. two - year - old celran, while the oldest bowhead whale is recorded 211 years old). Although the underlying difference in age remains uncertain, many studies show that the ability to repair DNA damage is an important mammal's life span. In a 1974 study by Hart and Setlow, it was discovered that the ability to improve DNA was increasing systematically as species lived among seven species of mammals. The species's age correlates strongly with the capacity to identify DNA's double editing damage and the protein level of DNA repair, Ku80. In the study of cells from 16 species of mammals, genes used in DNA repair are regulated upwards in longer-lived species. The levels of DNA repair enzymes, poly ADP ribose polymerase, in cells correlate with the age of species in the study of 13 mammal species. Three additional studies of mammal species also report correlation between the age of species and the ability to repair DNA. An animal is called locomotion if it moves its entire body from one place to another.

Nevertheless, the digitrad mammals are also good at moving quietly. Some such animals as horses include unuligrad or walk on their toes. This way of walking is increasing their pace and their speed. Some mammals in large ape groups are also known to walk on their knuckles, at least with their forelegs. Giant grinders and platypus also walk with their knuckles. Some mammals are bibedals that use only two extremities to move, which can be seen, for example, in humans and great apes. A bipedal species has a larger field of vision than a four-legged animal, saves more energy, and has the ability to manipulate objects with their hands, which helps in finding food. Instead of running, some bipedal jump, like kangaroos and kangaroo rats. Mammals show a wide range of styles, which is their order of extremities for locomotion. It can be grouped into categories according to its movement sequence pattern. For four - legged animals, there are three main categories: walking clucky styles, eloping styles, and jumping styles. Walking is the most common style. Some feet are on the ground at a certain time, and this force is found on virtually every animal with its legs.

For example, the main force of the human cluck is walking and running bilingally, but sometimes they use some other creeping force, such as four feet in a narrow space. Arboreal animals often have long extremities that help them cross cracks, reach fruit or other objects, test branch strength in front of them, and in some cases, for brakiasi (swing among trees). Many species of arboreal, such as tree hedgehogs, silk grinders, spider monkeys, and posiums, use prehensil tail to hold branches. In spider monkeys, the tip of the tail has a patch or an glue pad that helps increase the friction. Claws can be used to interact with rough objects and change the course of animal movement. This is what allows squirrels to climb so large tree trunks. Claws, however, can interfere with the animal's ability to capture a very small branch because they can circle too far and pierce the animal's own hand. Primates gripped by harnessing the friction and relying on the hairless fingertips. Squeezeing the branches with their fingertips results in a stroke force that holds the animal's hand into the branch.

Small body sizes give many benefits to species of arboreal, such as increasing the relative size of tree branches to animals, lower mass centers, increased stability, lighter mass (which allows animals to move on smaller branches), and the ability to move through messy habitats. The body's size is associated with body mass, thus affecting animals that glide like syrup. Several species of primates, bats, and all sloth species reach passive stability by hanging under branches of trees. Bats are the only mammals that can really fly. They fly in the air at a constant rate by moving their wings up and down. While bats are moving, there are airflows relative to their bodies, combined with the speed of their wings, producing faster air currents on the wings. This produces a lift - force vector that leads forward and upward, as well as a drag - style vector that leads backwards and upwards. This upper component resists gravity, keeping the body in the air, while the forward component gives an incentive to resist the force of attraction, both from the wings and from the body as a whole.

In bats, this sensitive area is different because each bump has tiny hairs in its center that make it more sensitive and allow bats to detect and collect information about the air flowing over its wings, and fly more efficiently by changing the shape of its wings. Fossorial is an animal that adapts to digging, which lives mainly, but not just underground. Some examples are badgers and naked land rats. Many rodent species are also considered fosorial because they spend most of the day living in burrows.

Most mammals that weigh less than 18 ounces (510 g; 1.1 pounds) are insect eaters because they cannot perform the slow and complex herbivorous digestive process. On the other hand, larger animals produce more heat and lose less heat. Hence, they can tolerate the slower food collecting process (like carnivores that eat larger vertebrates) or slower digestive processes (as in herbivor). Further, mammals weighing more than 18 ounces (510 g; 1.1 pounds) usually cannot collect enough insects during their wake-up hours to meet their energy needs. The only large insect-eating mammals are mammals that feed on large insect colonies. Some mammals belong to omnivor and show different levels of carnivorous and herbivor properties, which are generally more inclined to one type than the other. Since plants and meat are digested differently, there is a preference for being eaters of one, such as in bears that some species are mostly carnivores and other species mostly herbivors.",

Hyperkarnivor has a cone - shaped tooth and a sharp causal for cutting meat, and in some cases, a strong jaw to crush bones, as in hiena, that allows them to consume bones; some groups of mammals that have become extinct, especially Machairodontinae, have sword-shaped fangs. Some mammals who are physiologically carnivorous consume plant matter, while some herbivor consume meat. From the behavioral aspects, this would make them omnivor, but from a physiological point of view, it's probably because of zofarmakogosis. Physically, animals must be able to acquire energy and nutrients from plant and animal matter to be considered omnivor. For example, some animals with claws such as giraffes, camels, and cows have been recorded eating bones to consume certain minerals and nutrients. Moreover, cats, commonly considered carnivorous obligates, sometimes eat grass to regurgitate inexplicable material (like a ball of hair), help produce hemoglobin, and as a laxator. When there is not enough food available in an environment, many mammals suppress metabolism and conserve their energy in a process known as hibernation. In the period before hibernation, large mammals, such as bears, became polyphages to increase fat deposits, while smaller mammals preferred to collect and store food. The metabolic slowdown is accompanied by a drop in heart and breathing rate, as well as an internal temperature drop in some cases that can be around environmental temperatures. For example, the internal temperature of the hibernate ground squirrel may drop to 0\u00b02.9 \u00b0C (26.8 \u00b0F), but its head and neck are always above 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F).",

In intelligent mammals, like primates, the brain is relatively large than the rest of the brain. Intelligence itself is not easily defined, but indications of intelligence include the ability to study and behavioral flexibility. Rats, for example, are considered very clever because they can learn and do new tasks, a skill that may be important when they first invade new habitats. In some mammals the gathering of food seems to be associated with intelligence: deer that eat vegetation have a brain smaller than cats, who have to think about deceiving their prey. The use of tools in animals can show different levels of learning and cognition. The sea beaver regularly uses the rock as an important part of its feeding behavior (to destroy abalone or break shell), with some of its population of sea otters spending 21% of its time making utensils. The use of other tools, such as chimpanzees that use twigs for termites, may develop after seeing others use tools and perhaps even become a real example of animal teaching. Tools can even be used in solving puzzles when the animal seems to have an eureka moment. Other mammals who do not use tools, such as dogs, can also experience an eureka moment. The size of the brain was once considered a major indicator of animal intelligence. Because most of the brain is used to maintain body function, the brain mass ratio to greater body mass can increase brain mass for more complex cognitive tasks. The alometric analysis shows that the scale of the mammal's brain is approximately 2\u20443 or 3\u20444 exponents of body mass.",

Self-awareness seems to be a sign of abstract thought. Self - awareness, although not well defined, is believed to be the beginning of a more advanced process such as metaogniative reasoning. The traditional method for measuring self-awareness is a mirror test, which determines whether an animal has the ability to recognize itself. The mammals who have passed mirror tests among the Asian elephants (some have graduated, some have not); chimpanzees; bonobos; orangutans; humans, since 18 months; bottlenose dolphins,c] killer whales; and fake killer whales. Eusociality is the highest form of social organization. Inside there are overlapping generations and clear work divisions, such as groups responsible for reproduction and groups that care cooperatively for offspring. Eusocial behavior is usually shown by insects, such as bees, ants, and termites. This is also shown, however, in two species of rodents, the naked mole rats and mole damaraland rats. Presociality is when animals show more than sexual interaction among the same species, but not qualified as eusocial. That means, presocial animals can display a commercial life, cooperative genetic care, or primitive reproductive work division, but they don't display all three of them that are important characteristics of eusocial animals.

The fission-fusion group is a social group that often changes numbers and compositions. The animals form a permanent social group called the parent group, which consists of all members of a community, but its numbers often vary to track changes in their environment. In fission groups, parent groups can separate into stable, less stable individuals or subgroups to adapt to environmental or social conditions. For example, a number of males may separate themselves from the main group for hunting or for feeding during the day, but at night they can rejoin (fusion) to the main group to share food and share in other activities. Many mammals point to this, such as primates (e.g. orangutans and spider monkeys), elephants, leopards, lions, and dolphins. Solitary animals maintain territory and avoid social interactions with their fellow species, except during mating season. This is done to avoid resource competition because two individuals of the same species will occupy the same strain, as well as to prevent food shortages. When it comes to feeding, a solitary animal is not too striking for its predators or prey. In a hierarchy, individuals are dominant or submisive. The pharmacist hierarchy is a condition when one individual is dominant while the other is subjugated, as in wolves and lemurs, and the order of power is the linear rank for the individual who puts the top individual and the bottom individual.

Some mammals are totally monogamous, meaning they pair up for life and have no other mates (even after the death of their original mate), like wolves, biwara eurasia, and beavers. There are three types of polygamy in animals: either one or some dominant males have the right to mate (poligini), some males that are married by females (poliandri), or some males have exclusive relationships with many females (poliginary). Polignic marriages are far more common, which, if exempt from lek marriage, are estimated to occur at 90% of the mammals. Lex's marriage occurs when males gather around female animals and try to draw their attention to them with various demonstrations and vocalizations, like harbor seals. All high - level mammals (not including monotrematas) have two major adaptations in caring for offspring, which are giving birth to living and breast - feeding children. This leaves us with a broad choice in how to care for offspring. They may build nests and dig dens to raise their children or feed them and guard them that are often done over a long period of time. Many mammals are of a selection-K and invest more time and energy in their children than in the animals of selection-r. when two animals mate, they both have the same desire for the success of their offspring, although often in extreme forms.

They are the most popular pets, with tens of millions of dogs, cats, and other animals, including rabbits and mice, who are raised by families worldwide. Mammals such as mammoths, horses, and deer are among the earliest art subjects found in cave paintings in Late Paleolithum, such as in Lascaux Cave, France. Leading artists like Albrecht D\u00fcrer, George Stubbs, and Edwin Landseer are known for portraits of their mammals.

There's a difference of opinion between animal roles as human companion and their existence as individuals with their own rights. Further, mammals also play a variety of roles in literature, movies, mythology, and religion. The mammal domestication played an important role in the development of agriculture and civilizations in the Neolithic times, which led to the emergence of farmers substituting for hunters around the world.d] Transition of hunting and pricing into grazing and planting plants is a major step in human history.

Crossing, whether deliberate or unintentional, of two species of animals (or more) closely related through captivity, is an activity that humans have done for thousands of years for economic purposes. The cross between different subspecies in a species (such as between a Bengal tiger and a cyberther) is known as an intraspecific hybrid. The cross between different species in the same genus (such as lions and tigers) is known as interspecific crossovers. The cross between the different genes (such as sheep and goats) is known as intergeneric hybrids. Naturally, crossovers will occur in hybrid zones, when two species populations in the same genus or species living in the same area or nearby will mate. Some hybrids have been recognized as species, although controversial, like red wolves. An artificial selection, which is selective breeding of domestic animals by humans, is being used to re-fertilize recently extinct animals to produce a strain of animals with phenotypes that resemble the extinct wild ancestors. The re-intraspecific hybrid may have a display, an ecological strain, and to some extent, genetics, which is very similar to the extinct wild type, but the early lunar genes of that wild type have been lost forever since its extinction.

In 1786, Charles III of Spain provided Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois Chabaneau with a library and laboratory to help with his research on platinum. Chabaneau managed to remove some impurity from ore, including gold, mercury, lead, copper, and iron. This led him to believe that he was working with a single metal, but in reality the ore still had an unknown platinum-type metal. This led to inconsistent trials. At one point, platinum seemed soft, but when coupled with iridium, it became very fragile. Sometimes the metal can't burn, but when combined with osmium, it evaporates. After a few months, Chabaneau successfully produced 23 kg (50.71 pounds) of pure, soft platinum by hammering and pressing the sponge when it was white to burn. Chabeneau realized platinum would be valuable in the making of various objects, so he immediately started a business with Joaquin Cabezas to produce platinum ingots and platinum utensils. This is the beginning of the platinum age in Spain. In 2007, Gerhard Ertl won the Nobel Chemical for the determination of the molecular oxidation mechanism carbon monoxide using platinum (as a catholic modifier).

If a pure platinum is found in placer deposits or other ore, it can be isolated from them by various methods of impurity reduction. Since platinum is significantly denser than many impurities, a lighter impurity can be eliminated by simply floating away in fluid. Platina is magnetic, while nickel and iron are both feromagnetic. These impurities are then eliminated by the flow of electromagnets above the mix. Since platinum has a melting point higher than most other substances, many impurities can be burned or melted without melting platinum. Finally, platinum is resistant to hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid, while other substances are vulnerable to these two acids. Metal impurity can be removed by stirring a mixture in one of these two acids, and restoring the platinum that was left behind. One method that is easy for rough platinum purifying, which contains platinum, gold, and other platinum - class metals, is to process it using aqua regia, which can dissolve palladium, gold and platinum, while osmium, iridium, rhodium and rhodium do not react. Gold is kept in addition to iron chloride and after gold is separated by filtering, platinum is stored as a chloroplatinate ammonium with an addition to ammonium chloride. Ammonium chloroplates can be converted into platinum with warming. Unmistakable hexlooplatinates can be reduced with tin elements, and platinums are obtained with the same methods performed in the recovery of platinum residue on a laboratory scale. Of the 224 tons of platinum sold in 2013, 101 tons were used for vehicle emissions control equipment (45%), 66.3 tons for jewelry (30%), 19.4 tons for the production of chemicals and oil processing (8.7%), and 5.88 tons for electronic applications such as hard disk drives (2.6%).",

This element has been used as a catalyst since the early 19th century, when platinum dust was used to catalyze hydrogen ignition. The most important application is in automotives as catalytic converts (catalytic converter), which allows complete burn of unburned hydrocarbons concentrated low from exhaust to carbon dioxide and water vapor. Platina is also used in the oil industry as a catalyst in a number of splitting processes, but especially in the form of dialysis (catalytic reforming) nafta chain into a higher octana-based gasoline that becomes rich in aromatic compounds. PtO2, also known as the Adams catalyst, is used as a hydrogenation catalyst, especially for vegetable oil. Platina also catalyses the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen and is used in fuel cells as catalysts to reduce oxygen. From 1889 to 1960, the meter is defined as the length of the platinum-iridium alloy metal rod (90:10), known as the International Prototype Metre. The previous trunk was made from platinum in 1799. The International Prototype Kilogram remains defined by a platinum-iridium alloy tube made in 1879. Standard hydrogen electrode also uses platinum-plated platinum electrodes given its resistance to corrosion and other properties. Platina is a valuable metal commodity; it has an ISO XPT currency code. Coins, bars, and ingots were traded or collected.

Watchmakers appreciate platinum's unique properties, as neither easily tarnished nor aus (called last relative to gold). The price of platinum, like any industrial commodity, is more volatile than gold. In 2008, platinum prices went from $2.252 to $774 per oz, almost 2\u20443 in loss of value. Instead, the price of gold fell from ~$1,000,000 to ~$700/oz at the same period, only losing 1\u20443 of its value. During a stable and sustainable period of economic growth, platinum prices tend to be twice the price of gold, while during an uncertain economic period, platinum prices tend to drop due to a decrease in industrial demand, falling under the price of gold. Gold prices are more stable in slow economic periods, since gold is considered a safe haven. Although gold was used in industrial applications, his demand was not particularly affected by industrial use, in the 18th century, platinum scarcity made King Louis XV of France decree that platinum was the only metal suitable for the king. In the lab, platinum wire is used as electrodes, platinum dishes and buffers are used in thermogravimetry analysis due to strict requirements for chemical ininertity in high temperature warming (~1000 \u00b0C).

As for this Gnostic stream given by Demiurgos and Martin Luther, it teaches that the law of the Torah made everyone aware of every sin he had committed. However, this teaching from Luther was opposed by John of Agrrikola who said that the Law had no meaning or benefit whatsoever. John of Agrrikola also said, that a repentance occurred not because of the law of the Law, but through the preaching of the Gospel of Salvation.

The word prokaryota (caryon) was from Greece (pro-) \"before\" +  care\u03bd (caryon) \"tacks or seeds\". Procariota was divided into two domains: bacteria and Archaea. Archaea hasn't been recognized as a domain since 1990. Archaea was originally thought to live only in uncomfortable conditions, such as in extreme temperatures, pHs and radiation, but then Archaea was found in various habitats as well. Eukariota has a nucleus of cells containing DNA, while procaratics have no nucleus of the cell and their genetic material is not in the membrane. Because of the vast diversity of structure and genetics of both, in 1977 Carl Woese broke the procaritata into bacteria and Archaea (formeria and Archaebacteria), by proposing a three-domain system of Eukariota (or \"Euwork\"), Bacteria, and Archaea, which revised the two kingdoms. The genome of the procaritata is located in a DNA/protein complex in the cytosol, called the nucleusoid, which has no nuclear membrane. Procariota generally has no cell membrane compartments such as mitochondria and chloroplasts so that oxidative phosphorylation and photosynthesis occur along plasma membranes. However, procariota has internal structures, such as cytoskeletons, and special bacteria ordo Planctomycetes have membranes around nucleoids and cell membrane organelles. Procariota also contains only one stable chromosomal DNA circle, stored in a nucleusoid, while DNA in the eukaryota is found in a sealed, organized chromosome.

Bacteria and archea breed asexually, which is mostly binary fission or buds. A genetic exchange and recombination can happen, but it's a horizontal gene transfer, and it's not a replication, which involves DNA being transferred between two cells, as is the bacteria conjugation. Recent research indicates that all procariota have a cytoskeleton more primitive than a cytoskeleton eukiota. In addition to homology of actin and tubulin (MreB and FtsZ) components of the helix flagella, called flagellin, are one of the cytoskeletal proteins of the most important bacteria as the structural background provider of the chemox, the psychological response of the cell that is the base of bacteria. At least some procariota also contain intrasel structures of primitive organella. A membrane organ (or membrane between cells) is found in some procariota such as vakuola and membrane systems that are used exclusively for metabolism, such as photosynthesis or chemolithotrophy. Some species also contain microcompartements accompanied by proteins that have a specific physiological role (e.g., carboxsisome or air vakuola).

However, many scientists question this conclusion, for they claim that the present - day procariota species evolved from a more complex eukaryotic ancestor through simplification. Other scientists believe that three domains appear simultaneously, from a range of different cells that form one gene pool, this conversion was summed up in 2005: there is no consensus among biologists about the eukaryota position in the evolutionary scheme. A recent opinion on the evolution of the eukaryota includes: Procariota's oldest fossil was discovered some 3.5 billion years ago, about 1 billion years after the formation of the earth's crust. Even today, procariota may be the most successful and numerous life-forms. Eukariota appears in fossil records some time later, and may have formed from the endocimosis of some procariota ancestors. The oldest fossil eukaryota is about 1.7 billion years old. Some genetic evidence, however, points to the conclusion that the eukaryota appeared 3 billion years ago. The Earth is the only place life is found, but some scientists argue that there is evidence of life procaritata on Mars; but this opinion still becomes skeptical and debate is considered.

The first celebration of the Ilinden-Preobrazhenie rebellion that coincided with Saint Eliyah's day on August 2 was also celebrated as a day of widespread independence in Macedonia. The Macedonian Republic remained peaceful and safe in the early 1990s. The issue of border dispute with Yugoslavia has already been resolved by agreeing to the demarcation line between two countries. The relationship between Yugoslavia and Macedonia was once disturbed by 300,000 Albanian ethnicities that entered Macedonia during the 1999 Kosovo War. Although many Albanian ethnics returned to their origin after the Kosovo War was over, there were some Albanian ethnics who became radicals and rebelled to create a Republic for the Albanian ethnicity in Macedonia. The civil war between the Macedonian Republic and the Albanian ethnic rebels found in northern and western Macedonia lasted from March to June 2001. The war ended after a NATO intervention sent a peacekeeper's army and asked both sides to make peace. Then came the Signing of the Testament of Ohrid, which contained a treaty by the Macedonian Republic that would provide a place in politics and culture to the Albanian ethnicities. The Albanians then agreed to this agreement and were willing to surrender and submit completely to the power of the Macedonian Republic. The Albanian rebel army, NLA, was then disarmed and the disarmed weapon was given to NATO troops. In 2005, the Macedonian Republic was considered to be a candidate for the European Union.

Macedonia is a country trapped by land, yet it has three natural lakes called Lake Ohrid, LakePrespa and Dojran. So Macedonia had a water area of 477 km2 and an area of land of 24,856 km2. The country of Macedonia was located in mountain-mountained areas covered by valleys and deep basins. The Macedonian region was divided by a river called the Vardar River. Nearly a portion of Macedonia stretched over land from \u25aaara to Osgovo that formed the valley from the Vardar River. Three large lakes, Lake Ohrid, Lake Prespa, and Dojran are located in the southern part of Macedonia with Greece and Albania. Lake Ohrid is considered to be one of the world's oldest lakes and biotops. The Macedonian area was also an active area of seismic activity and was often an earthquake in Macedonia. The last great earthquake was in 1963 in Skopje, resulting in the destruction of infrastructure and the loss of more than 1000 lives. The Macedonian Republic also had many beautiful mountains. These mountains are divided into two sets of Dinarska and Ropodska. Dinarska's mountain range is an area prone to erosion, while the Ropodska mountain range tends to be similar to that of the Alps.

Helium is colorless, odorless, tasteless, nontoxic, almost inert, a monatomic gas, and is the first element of the noble gas class in the periodic table. The boiling point and the melting point of the gas are the lowest of all elements. Helium is materialized only as gas except in extreme conditions. Extreme conditions are also needed to create a few helium compounds, all unstable at standard temperature and pressure. Helium has a second stable isotope called helium-3. The properties of helium-4 variations; helium I and helium II; are important for researchers who study quantum mechanics (especially in superfluidity phenomena) and for those who seek the effects of approaching the absolute zero temperatures that matter has (like superconductivity). Helium is the second - largest and second - diluted element of the universe, covering 24% of the mass of the total mass of the universe and 12 times the mass of the entire mass of other heavy elements. The same abundance of helium can also be found in the Sun and Jupiter. This is due to the high energy binding of the nucleus helium-4 compared to three other chemical elements after helium. This helium-4 binding energy is also responsible for the abundance of helium-4 as a product of both nuclear fusion and radioactive decay. Most helium in this universe is helium-4, which is believed to have been formed during the great explosion. Some new helium is also formed through hydrogen nuclear fusion in the universe.

Helium is used in cryogenics, deep-sea respiratory systems, superconductor magnet cooling, \"helium robbery\", balloon development, airlifting and as protective gas for industrial use (such as \"busar reproducing\") and silicon wafering).

This spectrum was detected by French astronomer Jules Janssen during a total solar eclipse in Thunder, India. This spectrum line was first assumed as sodium. On October 20th of the same year, British astronomer Norman Lockyer also monitored the same yellow line in the sun's spectrum, which he then named Fraunhofer D3 because this line is adjacent to the known sodium D1 and D2 lines.

On March 26, 1895, Scottish chemist Sir William Ramsay managed to isolate the helium on Earth by treating cleveit minerals with various types of mineral acid. Ramsay tried to find an argon element, but after separating nitrogen and oxygen from released gases, he found the same bright yellow line as the D3 line monitored from the Sun. This gas sample was later identified as helium by Lockyer and British physicist William Crookes. Helium was also separately isolated from the cleveit mineral in the same year by chemists Per Teodor Cleve and Abraham Langlet in Uppsala, Sweden, who managed to gather enough helium gas content to accurately determine its atomic weight. Helium was also isolated by American geochemist William Francis Hillebrand before the discovery of Ramsay when he noticed an unusual spectrum line when he was testing the sample of the Uraninit mineral. Nevertheless, Hillebrand thought that this spectrum line was caused by nitrogen. In 1907, Ernest Rutherford and Thomas Royds showed that alpha particles are helium nuclei by first allowing these particles to penetrate thin vacuum tube walls and then produce a disarming in the tube for later study the spectrum of gases that are inside the tube. In 1908, helium was successfully made liquid by Dutch physicist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes by cooling this gas to a temperature less than one kelvin.

Similarly, the stability of the helium-4 atomic nucleus also produces the same effect, and is responsible for the ease of helium-4 forming in atomic nuclear reactions involving both emissions and heavy particle fusion. Some stable helium-3s are produced in hydrogen fusion reactions, but they're very small compared to helium-4. Stability of helium-4 is because hydrogen is converted to helium-4 (and not deuterium or helium-3) in the Sun's nuclear reaction. Unconventional helium-4 core stability is also very important in cosmology. The stability of the helium-4 nucleus explains why in the first minutes after the Great Bang, almost all the atomic nuclei formed are helium-4 nuclei. The helium-4 nuclei are so tight that helium-4 production consumes almost all free neutrons within minutes before the neutrons undergo beta decay, leaving only a few neutrons to form more heavy atoms like lithium, beryllium, and boron. The binding of helium-4 nucleone nuclei is more powerful than those elements (see nucleogenesis and binding energy) so none of the energy impulses available again are immediately formed to form elements 3, 4, and 5. Energyally, helium can almost undergo enough fusion to form the following elements with lower energy per nucleus, carbon. However, due to the absence of intermediate elements, this process requires three helium nuclei to collide with each other (see the alpha tripel process). Hence, there is virtually no time available for carbon to form significantly a few minutes after the dahesat explosion before the universe begins to cool down and expand.",

All the more heavy elements (including the elements necessary to form planets like Earth or life) are formed by the greatest explosion in the star that has enough heat to run helium fusion by itself. All the elements besides hydrogen and helium that exist today include only 2% of the mass of the universe's matter. Instead, helium-4 occupys about 23% of the ordinary matter of the universe. Helium is the most unreactive noble gas after neon, and therefore is the second least reactive element of all elements; Helium is inert and monoatomic under all standard conditions. Due to relatively low atomic mass of helium molar, the thermal conductivity of helium, the color of helium, and the speed of sound in helium gas is greater than any other gas except hydrogen. The size of helium atoms is also very small, so the rate of helium diffusion in solid matter is three times faster than the normal air and its speed is 65% than the rate of hydrogen diffusion. Helium is a monoatomic gas that is at least dissolved in water. The helium refraction index is also the closest one to the index of refraction. Helium has negative Joule-Thomson coefficient values at normal temperatures, which means it heats up when it's allowed to expand freely. It cools when it expands at lower temperatures than Joule-Thomson's inversion temperature, which is about 32 to 50 K's on 1 atmosphere. Soon helium is cooled below this temperature, helium can be searched through the cooling of the harvest.",

In a plasma state, helium's electrons are not bound to their core, resulting in extremely high helium plasma conductivity. These charged particles are highly affected by magnetic and electrical fields. For example, during solar storms, ionized helium and ionized hydrogen interacted with earth's magnetosphere and produced Birkeland currents and aurora phenomena. Unlike other elements, helium will remain liquid at absolute zero and normal pressure. This is a direct effect of quantum mechanics: principally, zero-point energy systems are too high for systems to compact. Helium can be pressed at temperature 1,101.5 K (about 272 \u00b0 C) and pressure 25 bars (2.5 MPa). It's very difficult to distinguish solid helium from liquid helium because the index of refraction between these two phases is almost the same. Solid Helium has a crystal structure and a very small stretch of melting point. Moreover, it can also be compressed; if pressed, the volume will decrease by more than 30%. With a modulus value of about 27 MPa, helium is dense ~100 times more compressed than water. Solid Helium has a mass of 0.214 c. 0.006 g/cm3 at 1.15 K and 66 atm; projected mass of the type is 0.187 c. 0.009 g/cm3 at 0 K and 25 bars (2.5 MPa). At the temperature below the boiling point of 4.2 K and above the point of the lambda 2.1768 K, isotop helium-4 is a form of colorless fluid, which is called helium I. Just like any other cryogenic fluid, helium I boils when heated and shrinks when cooled. Heliu I has a gaslike index of 1,026, which makes the surface difficult to see, so the floating polystyrene foam is generally used to detect where the surface of this fluid is located.",

Quantum mechanics is required to explain this disparity and therefore, both helium-I and -I fluid are called quantum fluid, which means that both display quantum atomic properties on a macroscopic scale. This is the effect of its boiling point value, which is very close to absolute zero, thus blocking random motions of molecules to hide their atomic properties. The liquid Helium that is under the point of its lambda begins to display unusual traits. Helium in this state is referred to as helium II. helium II treatment is not possible because of its highly thermal conductivity; the warming given to helium II will cause evaporation directly into gas. Helium 3 also has a superfluide phase, but at lower temperatures; therefore, it is unknown to many of the properties of isotopes of helium-3. Helium II is a superfluide, an unusual state of quantum mechanics of matter. For example, this fluid will flow through a seperated capillary tube from 10 to 10 feet [108 m] but still not measured for its viscosity. However, when measurements are made between two moving disks, the viscosity value equal to helium gas will be measured. Current theory explains this using a model of two fluids for helium II. In this model, liquid helium below the point of the lambda is viewed as having a partial helium atom in its base state which is superfluid and flows with the exact value of viscosity zero, and some are in an exclusive state, which behaves just like any other common fluid.",

In the gushing effect, a ventricle is built and connected to a tandon of helium II via the center disk. Helium superfluida will penetrate into the ventricles easily but non-superfluid helium will not penetrate it. If the interior chamber is heated, helium superfluda will turn into non-superfluide helium. In order to keep the balance of helium superfluide, helium superfluide will enter the ventricle and increase the pressure, resulting in fluid gushing out of the ventricle. Helium II has the largest thermal conductivity of any known substance. Its conductivity is a million times greater than the thermal conductivity of helium I and several hundred times more than the thermal conduct of copper. This is because the delivery of the wear is due to specific quantum mechanisms. Most of the matter that conducts flow well has free electron valence ribbons that conduct curds. Helium II doesn't have such valence ribbons but sends them a good flow. The flux delivery of helium II is governed by an equation similar to the wave equation used to characterise sound in the air. When given, the case will be removed 20 meters per second at 1.8 K as a wave. This phenomenon is known as the second sound. Helium II also showed a growing effect. When helium is held inside a wall of high containers, helium II will move across the surface of the container against the force of gravity. Helium II will escape from a shelter that is not blocked by creeping into the side of the shelter until it reaches warmer and evaporates.

There are at least eight known helium isotopes, but only helium-3 and helium-4 are stable. In Earth's atmosphere, there's only one atom 3He for every one million atoms 4He. Unlike other elements, the abundance of helium's isotopes vary depending on its origin because of a different process of formation. The most numerous isotopes are helium-4 and formed on Earth through alpha decay heavier radioactive elements. Alpha particles emerge from this decay form a ionized helium-4 nucleus. Helium-4 has unusual core stability because its nucleus is fully aligned. Helium-4 was also formed in enormous quantities during the ultimate nucleosinthesis of the explosion. Helium 3 is found on Earth only in the sum of semiimites; most of them already exist during the formation of the Earth, although some fall to Earth trapped in cosmic dust. The intermittent helium-3 is also formed through beta tritium decay. These rocks that come from the Earth's crust have a varied helium isotopes ratio, and these ratios are used to investigate the origin of the rocks and composition of the Earth's coat. 3He is more abundant in the stars as a product of nuclear fusion.

Liquid Helium-4 can be cooled up to a temperature of about 1 K using evaporative cooling. Using the same cooling process, helium-3 can reach a temperature of approximately 0.2 K. At a temperature lower than 0.8 K, a mixture of 3He and 4He fluid in the same amount will adjust itself into two phases that are non-mixed. This is caused by the inequality of both isotopes, which are quantum atoms helium-4 including boson, while helium-3 atoms include fermion.

Helium-6 decays by begging for beta particles and at half of 0.8 seconds. Helum-7 also begs for beta particles other than gama. Helium-7 and helium-8 formed in certain nuclear reactions. Helium-6 and helium-8 are well-known to show nuclear halos. Helium has zero chemical valence, so it won't react chemically under normal conditions. Helium is a good electrical insulator, unless it is ionized. Like any noble gas, helium has a metastable energy level that allows it to keep it ionized by the voltage below its potential ionization. Helium can form unstable compounds, known as excismers, with tungsten, iodine, fluorine, sulfur, and phosphorus when exposed to viscera, electron collision, or plasma from other causes.

Helium was found in large quantities in uranium and torium minerals, including cleveits, uraninits. carnotits, and monazites, because these minerals are begging for alpha particles. As these particles collide with rock, the electrons will join the nucleus and form helium gas. It is estimated that about 3,000 tons of helium is produced per year through this process. In the Earth's crust, its helium concentration is about 8 parts per billion. In seawater, the concentration is only about 4 parts per trillion. helium's greatest concentration on Earth was found trapped along with natural gas. This is where most of the commercial helium is extracted. Its concentrations vary from some ppm to more than 7% like the ones in the San Juan County gas field, New Mexico. For use on a large scale, helium is extracted using fractional distillation natural gas, which can contain 7% helium. Because helium has lower boiling points than any other element, the low temperature and high pressure used will melt almost all other gases (most of nitrogen and methane). The helium bruto gas produced by fractional distillation is then refined by repeatedly lowering the gas temperature, so most of the nitrogen and other remaining gases will settle out of the mixture of gas.

A number of inert protective gases are used in the welding of a wolfram gas bow, but helium is preferred above argon especially for welding materials that have higher heat conductivity, such as aluminum or copper. One of the helium applications in the industry is leak detection. Since helium is diffusing through solid materials three times faster than air, it is used as a trace gas to detect leaks in empty-tingy devices (like cryogenic tanks) and high - pressure containers. The tested object is inserted into a vessel, which is then emptied and filled with helium. Helium can exit through leaks and be detected by sensitive spectrometers (helim mass), although the leak rate is very small at only 10 .9 mbar\u00b7L/s (1010 Pa\u00b7m3/s). The measurement procedure takes place automatically and is called helium integral testing. A simpler procedure is to fill a testable object with helium and perform a manual search for leaks using portable equipment.

Although there are morphological similarities between archea and bacteria, archea has genes and several metabolic pathways that are more similar to eukaryota, especially enzymes involved in transcription and translatation. One aspect of the archea biochemical unique is the dependency of the archeatic lipid ether on their cell membranes. Arkea uses more energy than eukaryota, which ranges from such organic compounds as sugar, ammonia, metal ions, or even hydrogen gas.

Morphological, metabolic, and geographical diversity allows them to have a broad ecological role, such as in carbon fixation in the carbon cycle, a role in the nitrogen cycle, the rotation of organic compounds, and the preservation of symbiotic communities and microbial synths. No clear example has been found for pathogenic or parasitic archea. On the other hand, archea is often a qualityist or a commensurate, such as a methane that lives in human digestive tracts and ruminansia, where they live in large quantities and helps the digestive.

In most of the 20th century, procariota was considered a group of organisms and was classified based on their biochemical, morphological properties, and metabolism. Microbiologists try to classify microorganisms based on the structure of cell walls, shapes, and substances they consume.

This approach, known as phylogenetics, is the primary method used today.

Other species of archea turned out to be closely related to one of these groups, such as Archaeal Richmond Mine achidphilic nanoorganisms found in 2006 and one of the smallest known organisms. A superfilum, called TACK, which includes Thaumarchaeota, Aigarchaeota, Crenarchaeota, and Korarchaeota, proposed in 2011 and may be associated with organisms that became the ancestors of the eukariota. By 2017 the Asgardian superfilum had been proposed as a group closer to the eukaryota and was a group of sisters from TACK. Here's a kladogram based on Tom A. Williams dkk.

        "paragraph": "Exclusive breeding criteria known in general (organism in one species can reproduce with one another but not with the other) are not helpful because archea reproduces in asexual way. The Arkea shows high levels of horizontal gene transfer between their bloodlines. Some researchers suggest that a number of individuals are grouped into species-like populations, whose genomes are very similar and rarely transfer genes or receive transfers of genes from other less-related cells, such as in the Ferroplasm genus. On the other hand, studies of the Halorubrum found significant genetic transfers to the less-related population, so the application of these criteria is limited. The second concern is the extent of what species are called practical meaning. Recent knowledge of genetic diversity remains incomplete and the number of species of archea cannot be accurately predicted. Estimates of the filum range between 18 JULI23, but only eight filums have representatives that have been cultured in the laboratory and studied directly. Many groups of archea are hypothesized only by a single rRNA sequence, which suggests that the differences between these organisms remain unclear. Bacteria also contain many uncultured microbs so that their characterization is similar to that of the archeaics. Earth is estimated to be about 4,54 billion years old. Scientific evidence suggests that life on Earth began at least 3.5 billion years ago. The early evidence of life on Earth is biogenic graphite on 3.7 - billion - year - old metaseditarian rock found in West Greenland and fossil microb mats found in sandstones as old as 3.48 billion years in Western Australia. In 2015, the possibility of \"the remains of biotic life\" was found in rock aged 4.1 billion years in Western Australia.",

        "paragraph": "Although the fossils of procaritata cells may have come from nearly 3.5 billion years ago, most procariots did not have a distinguished morphology, and fossil forms could not be used to identify them as archeologists. On the other hand, unique chemical lipid fossils become more informative because they do not exist in other organisms. Some publications claim that the remains of an archee's lipid or eukariota present in the shale came from 2.7 billion years ago; although that data was questionable. The Lipid is also detected in rocks that are even older than rocks in West Greenland. The oldest trace comes from the district of Isua, Greenland, which is one of the oldest sediments known on Earth that was formed 3.8 billion years ago. The archeatic bloodline may be the most ancient bloodline on Earth. Woese argues that bacteria, archea, and eukaryota represent separate bloodlines that branched from the very beginning of the ancestral colony of all organisms. One possibility is that this branch occurs before cell evolution, when no cell membrane allows an infinite lateral gene transfer, and that the ancestors of the three domains emerged from specific subset-subset genes. It's possible that the last ancestors of bacteria and archea were thermophyils, so lower temperatures might have been \"extreme environments\" for the archetypes, and the organisms that lived in the cold environment have recently emerged. Because Archaea and Bacteria are far apart from each other by eukaryota, the term procariota may point to the wrongness between the archea and the bacteria. The following table compares some of the main characteristics of the three domains, to describe their equations and differences.",

        "paragraph": "Archaea was separated as a third domain because it had a huge difference in their ribosomal RNA structure. Certain RNA molecules known as RNA ribosomal 16S (usually shortened to 16s rRNA) are key in the production of proteins in all organisms. Because this function is so important in life, organisms that have mutated 16s rRNA cannot survive that these nucleotide structures have been so stable (but not absolute) for generations. The size of 16s rRNA is also large enough to store specific information on specific organisms, but it's small enough to be sorted and compared in a short time. In 1977, Carl Woese, a microbiologist who studied the genetic sequence of organisms, developed a new method of comparison involving RNA solving into fragmentes that could be sorted and compared to other fragments of other organisms. The more similar the pattern of fragments between the species, the closer the relationship becomes. Woese uses his new method of comparison of rRNA to group and separate different organisms. He sequenced various species and discovered that a group of metanogens with rRNA turned out to be very different from known procariota or eukaryota. This Metanogen is much more like each other than any other organism has ever been sorted, so Woese proposes a new domain, Archaea. The Woese experiment suggests that archea is more similar to the eukaryota instead of the procariota, although their structure is more like the procarita. This concluded that Archaea and Eukih had a newer ancestor than Euwork and Bacteria. The development of the nucleus is followed by branches between bacteria and common ancestors. One unique trait of archea is the use of lipids with an etheric bond in abundance on their cell membranes.",

Comperative analysis of the archea genome has also identified some special indeles that are molecularly and certain proteins that are uniquely discovered both in all archea and found in some major groups in the archea . Another unique trait of archea is that no other organism is known to perform methanogenesis. Arkea methane plays an important role in ecosystems along with organisms that get energy from methane oxidation (most of them are bacteria) because they are often the main source of methane in the environment and can play the primary producer. Metanogens also play an important role in the carbon cycle, breaking organic carbon into methane, which is also a major greenhouse gas. Relationships between three domains are essential to understanding the origin of life. Most metabolic trajectories (which are objects of most of the genes of an organism) are equally owned by Archaea and Bacteria, while most of the genes involved in the same genome expression are owned by Archaea and Eukiga. Among procariota, the structure of the archea cell is most similar to that of the Gram-Positive bacteria, especially since they have a single layer of lipida and usually contain thick pocketles (exoskeleton) of various chemical compositions. In some filogenetic trees that are based on the gene-gen sequence of procariotic homologists, the archeic homologist is more closely associated with the Gram-positive bacteria homologist. Arkea and Gram-Positive bacteria also share integers preserved in a number of important proteins, such as Hsp70 and glutamin syntase I; yet, scientists interpret filogeny from these genes as a means of transferring interdomain genes, and may not reflect the relationship of organisms.",

This view was raised on observation that archeic resistance to the various antibiotics made primarily for Gram-positive bacteria, and that these antibiotics work primarily on genes that distinguish archea from bacteria. This opinion states that selective pressure against the resistance produced by Gram-positive antibiotics is finally enough to cause extensive changes in many of the gene targets of antibiotics, and that these strains represent the ancestors of today's archea. Archea evolution in response to antibiotic selection, or any competitive selective pressure, can also explain their adaptation to extreme environments (such as high temperatures or acidity) as a result of an empty strip search to escape from organisms producing antibiotics; Cavalier-Smith also makes the same proposal. This opinion is also supported by other studies that investigate structural protein connections and studies that show that the Gram-Positive bacteria may be the beginning of the earliest branched bloodline in procarita. The relationship of evolution between archea and eukariota is still unclear. Apart from the similarities in the structure and function of the cell discussed below, many genetic trees unite both in one group. The factors that complicate their relationship include the claim that the relationship between euchariota and the philum archea Crenarchaeota is closer than the relationship between the Crenarchaeota filum and the Eurarchaeota, and the gene-like presence of certain bacteria, as in Thermotoga maritima, of the horizontal gene transfer. Standard hypothesis states that the ancestors of the eukaryota separated from Archaea from the beginning, and that eukariota emerged through fusion between the archea and the bacteria, which became the nucleus of the cell and the cytoplasm; this explains genetic similarities but has difficulty explaining the structure of the cell.",

This organism is called a transitional organism between the procariota and the eukaryota. Some filum brothers from \"Lokiarchaeota\" have been discovered (\"Thorrchaeota\", \"Odinchaeota\"), which all formed a new Asgardian supergroup, which was probably no brother of Proteoracchaeo. The details of the relationship between Asgardian and eukariot members are still in consideration, although, in January 2020, scientists report that the Candidatus Prometheoarchaeum synthhicum, a form of Asgardian archea, may have been the link between a simple procariota microorganism and a complex eukariota microorganism some two billion years ago. One archea individual has diameters ranging from 0.1 micrometers to more than 15 \u25aams, which are present in various forms, generally as balls, rods, spirals, or plates. Other morphologists were found in the crenarchaeota filum, including irregular - shaped cells in the genus sulfolobus, jarlike filaments that were less than half a micrometer in the geneus thermophylum, as well as those that were almost rectangularly long in the Thermoproteus and Pyrobaculum. Haloquadratum walsbyi is an archea with flat square - shaped cells, which live in hypersalin pools. This unusual shape may be well preserved by cell walls and their prokariotic cytoskeleton. Proteins associated with cytoskeleton components of other organisms are found in archea, and filaments form in their cells, but unlike other organisms, these cellular structures are less understood. In Thermoplasta and Ferroplasm, the absence of cell walls means that cells have irregular shapes, and they can resemble ameba.",

Genus Pyrodictium produces a complex multicellular colony involving long, thin hollow tubes called canules that stand out from the cell's surface and connect them into a dense, bushy aglomeration. The function of these canaules is not agreed upon, but they can allow communication or nutrition exchange with their neighbors. A multispecies colony was also found, such as the \"pesseled pearls\" community found in 2001 in a swamp in Germany. The round whiteness colony of the new Euryarchaeota is located along a thin filament that can be up to 15 centimeters (5.9 inches) long; this filament is made of a particular species of bacteria. Arkea and bacteria have a common cell structure, but cell compositions and organizations distinguish archea from bacteria. Like bacteria, archea has no interior membrane and no organelle. Archea cell membranes, as well as bacteria, are usually limited by cell walls and they \"swim\" using one flagella or more. Structurally, the archeatics are most similar to the Gram-positive bacteria. Most archea has a plasma membrane and a single cell wall, without periplasmic space; the exception for this general rule is Ignicoccus, which has a very large periplasm that contains a periplasmic vesicle covered by an outer membrane. Most archea (except for Thermoplasma and Ferroplasm) has cell walls. The majority of the walls of the archeaic cells are assembled from surface layer proteins, which make up an S-layer, and the S-layer is a rigid protein molecule structure that covers the outer part of the cell (like a chain armor).

The archee's flagella operates like a bacterial flagella with its length driven by a motor turning at its base. It's powered by a proton gradient that crosses the membrane. Yet, the flagella archea is different, especially in composition and development. Both species of flagella evolved from different ancestors. The bacterial flagella has one ancestor with type III secretion system, while the archeatic flagella seems to evolve from an IV-type pill. Unlike hollow and assembled bacterial flagellas by subunits that move up from central pores to flagella ends, the archea flagella is synthesized by adding subunits at its base. Archea membranes are made from molecules that are very different from molecules in other organisms, which indicate that archea is related away from bacteria and eukariota. In all organisms, cell membranes are made of a molecule known as phospholipid. These molecules have poles that are soluble in water and nonpolar parts that don't dissolve in water. This different section is connected by the glycerol cluster. In water, phospholipid clusters, with heads facing water and tails away from water. The main structure in the cell membrane is this double layer of phosfolipid, called the lypida dwilayer.

This type of Arkea includes penitrifizers, metanogens, and anaerobic methane oxidors. In this reaction, one compound gives electrons to another (in redoxy reaction), releasing energy to fuel cell activity. One compound acts as an electron donor and one as an electron acceptor. The energy released produces adenosina triphosphate (ATP) through kemiosmosis, in the same basic process that occurs in eukaryic cell mitochondria. Other archea groups use sunlight as a source of energy (they're called phototrophs). However, photosynthesis that produce oxygen does not occur in these organisms. Many basic metabolic paths are shared by all forms of life; for example, archea uses modification forms of glycolysis (Entner's EntnerDodoroff) and one of the complete or partial citric acid cycles. Similarity with these other organisms may reflect that these basic metabolic pathways have origins at the beginning of life's history and high efficiency levels. Some euryarchaeota are metanaogens that live in anaerobic environments, such as swamps. This metabolic form evolved from its beginning, and perhaps even the first organisms to live freely were methane. Generally, reactions involve using carbon dioxide as an electron acceptor to oxidize hydrogen. Metanogenesis involved various unique coenzims for the archea, such as Koenzim M and methane. Other organic compounds such as alcohol, acetate acid, or format acid are used as alternative electron acceptors by methane. These reactions often occur in the archea that lives in the intestines. Acetic acid is also broken down into methane and carbon dioxide directly by acetrofi archea.

Crenarchaeota also uses the reverse Krebs cycle, while Euryarchaeota also uses the acetyl-CoA reductive pathways. This carbon fixation is supported by an inorganic energy source. No archea known to do photosynthesis. Archea energy sources vary greatly and range from ammonia oxidation by Nitrosopolales to hydrogen sulfide oxidation or sulfuric elements by species Sulfolobus, which uses oxygen or metal ions as electron acceptors. The phototrophic archea uses light to generate chemical energy in the form of ATP. At halobacteria, ion pumps are activated by light, like bacteria oropsin and halorodopsin, producing gradient ions by pumping ions out of cells across plasma membranes. The energy stored in the electrochemical gradient is then converted into ATP by the ATP synthase. This process is a form of photophosphorylation. The ability of the pump to move ions across the membrane depends on the changes that light empowers in the retinol cofactor structure in the center of the protein. The Arkea usually has a single circular chromosome, measuring up to 5,751,492 base pairs in the Methanasarcina acetivoros, the largest known genome of the archea. A tenth of this size is a small genome of 490.885 base pairs in the nanoarchaeum equitans, the genome of the smallest archea known; it's estimated to contain only 537 gene encoder-protein. Small independent pieces of DNA, called plasmids, are also found in arches. Plasmids can be transferred between cells with physical contact, in a process that may be similar to a bacterial conjugate.

Another typical archeic trait is a gene organization that functions like an enzyme that catalyzes the same metabolic pathways into the new operon, and big differences in the tRNA genes and their tRNA syntases. The archeology on the archeology is more like the transcription of eukaryota than the transcription of bacteria, with the RNA polymerase archeagoa is very similar to the similar enzyme on eukaryota; while the translatation on the archea shows signs of similarities, both in bacteria and in eukariota. Although archea has only one type of RNA polymerase, its structure and function in transcription seem to be close to RNA polymerase II on eukaryota, with the same set of proteins that direct the binding of RNA polymerase to gene promoters. Modifying after-symbol archeology is simpler than their eukariota because most of the archea genes don't have introns, although there are a lot of introns in their RNA transfer and RNA ribosomal genes, and introns may be in some of the genes encoder-protein. Hellobacterium volcanii, an extreme halofic archetype, formed a cytoplasm bridge between cells that seemed to be used to transfer DNA from one cell to another in two directions. When archea hyperthermophilic Sulfolobus and sulfateris and Sulfolobus acidocaldius are exposed to ultraungu radiation (UV) which damages DNA or bleomisin or mitomisin C, specific cellular aggression in the species will be produced.

Arkea became the target of a number of different viruses from the viruses that attacked bacteria and eukaryota. These viruses have been grouped in 15 BETH18 DNA-based families, but some species remain insulated and wait for classification. These families can be formally divided into two groups: specific viruses archea and cosmopolitan. The archea-specific virus targets only species of archea and currently includes 12 virus families. Many unique previously unidentified viruses have been found in this group, including bottle - shaped viruses, spindels, rolls, and droplets. Although the reproductive cycles and genome mechanisms of a specific-archea virus may be similar to other viruses, they have unique characteristics that are specially developed because of morphological morphology of host cells that they are infected with. Their virus release mechanisms are different from other phags. Bacteriaofag generally undergo lithic, lysogenic, or mixed paths both (though rare).

Krupovic dkk. (2018) states that high levels of horizontal gene transfer, rapid mutation rate in the viral genome, and a lack of universal gene sequence have led researchers to accept the evolution path of the archea virus as a network. The lack of similarities between the filogenetic markers in this network and the global virosphere, as well as external connections to nonvirus elements, may indicate that some species of specific virus evolved from the genetic element of the nonvirus (MGE) cellular (MG). These viruses have been studied in detail in the thermophyil groups, especially the Sulfolobales and the Thermoproteales order. Two single DNA-editing strain groups infecting the archea have been isolated. One group is exemplified by the halorubrum pleomorphic virus 1 (\"Pleolipoviridae\") which infects the halofic archetype and the other by the spiral-shaped aeropyrum virus (\"Spiraviridae\") which infects hyperthermophilic host (the optimal growth at 90 Bil95 \u00b0C). Spiraviridae is reported to have the largest ssDNA genome to date. The defense against this virus may involve RNA interference from the repetitive DNA sequence associated with the genes of the virus. Arkea reproduces sexually with binary or multiple fission, fragmentation, or bud; mitosis and meiosis don't occur, so if the species of archea have more than one form, they all have the same genetic material. Cell division is controlled in the cell cycle; once the cell chromosome is replicated and the two chromosomes of the child separate, the cell divides.

Some species of haloarchaea undergo phenotypic transition and grow as different types of cells, including thick walled structures that withstand osmotic shocks and allow archea to survive in water at low concentrations of salt, but this is not a reproductive structure and can help them to reach new habitats. The Arkea lives in habitats and is now recognized as a large part of the global ecosystem, which can contribute up to 20% of the earth's biomass. The first Arkea to be discovered was the extremist. Some archea can survive high temperatures, often above 100 \u00b0C (212 \u00b0F), as found in geyser, deep-sea hydrothermal vents, and oil wells. Other common habitats include very cold habitats and very salty, sour, or alkali water.

For example, one of the most extreme archea asidophyils is Picrophilus torridus, which grows at pH 0, which is equivalent to developing at 1.2 molar sulphate acid. Resilience to this extreme environment has made archeaics the focus of speculation on the possibility of extraterrestrial life. Some extremist habitats are no different than Mars, so it appears the possibility that the appropriate microbs could have been transferred among the planets in meteorites. Some studies show that archea not only exists in the mesophilic and thermophilic environment but also lives, sometimes in high numbers, at low temperatures. For example, archea is found largely in the environment of cold seas such as the polar sea. Even more significant is the discovery of a large number of archea throughout the world's oceans in nonextrem habitats among the plankton communities (as part of the picoplankton). Although this archea can be present in very high numbers (to 40% of microb biomass), virtually none of these species have been isolated and studied in pure culture.

It has been proved that in all ocean surface sediments (from water level 1,000 to 10,000 m), the effects of virus infection are higher in the archea than in bacteria; while, virus - induced lyses of an archea contribute to a third of the total microb biomass that is killed, resulting in a global release of ~0.3 to 0.5 gigatons of carbon per year. Arkea recycles elements like carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur in their habitats. The Arkea is involved in many steps of nitrogen cycle, which includes reactions that can remove nitrogen from ecosystems (such as nitrate - based and denitrification - based respirations) and processes that bring nitrogen (such as nitrate assimilation and nitrogen fixation). Researchers discovered an archea's involvement in ammonia oxidation reactions. These reactions are very important in the ocean. Arkea also seems to be important for ammonia oxidation on the ground. They produce nitrits, and the other microbs oxidize into nitrate. Plants and other organisms consume nitrate. On sulfuric cycles, archea that grows by oxidizing sulfur compounds releases these elements from the rock to be available to other organisms. However, the archea that does this, such as Sulfolobus, produces sulfuric acid as a waste product, and the growth of these organisms in abandoned mines can contribute to mine acid and other environmental damage.

Metanogen acts as the main partner who supports the bacteria fermentation process based on the synthrophy that works in a condition of lack of energy. One example of the well - understood mutualism is the interaction between protozoa and methane archeogen in the digestive tracts of animals that digest cellulose, such as ruminansia and termites. In this anaerobic environment, protozoans break plant cellulose to gain energy. This process releases hydrogen as a waste product, but hydrogen in high levels reduces energy production. When methane converts hydrogen into methane, protozoa benefits with more energy. In anaerobic protozoa, such as Plapopyla frontata, archea is in the protozoa and consumes hydrogen produced in their hydrogenosom. Arkea is also associated with larger organisms. For example, the marine archea Cenarchaeum symbiosum lives in (is an endosimbion of) a sponge of Axinella mexicana. Arkea can also be commental, which benefits from association without helping or harming other organisms. For example, Methanogen Metanobrevibacter smithii is the most common archea of human flora, which makes up about one in ten of all procaritatas in the human intestines.

In industry, amilase, galactoidase, and pullulanase of other species of Pyrooccus are functioning at temperatures above 100 \u00b0C (212 \u00b0F) thus enabling food processing at high temperatures, such as low - lactose milk production and whey. The enzyme of thermophilic archetype also tends to be very stable in organic solvents, so it can be used in environmental friendly processes in green chemicals that synthesize organic compounds. This stability makes it easier to use in structural biology. As a result, enzymes from equivalent extremists or eukaryotic enzymes are often used in structural studies. Unlike various apps for archeological enzymes, the use of self-organisms in biotechnology is less developed. Arkea methane is an important part of waste processing because they are part of the microorganism community that conducts anaerobic digestives and produces biogas. In mineral processing, asidoplic archea is viewed as promising to extract metal from ore, including gold, cobalt and copper. Arkea produced a new class of antibiotics that could potentially be used. Some archeosin antibiotics have been characterized, but hundreds of other potential antibiotics are believed to exist, especially from haloarchaea and Sulfolobus. These compounds have a different structure of bacteria-based antibiotics so they may have new ways of working.",

Morality is a standard of behavior that enables each person to live cooperatively in a group. Morality can refer to community sanctions related to proper and acceptable behavior. Moral etymologically derived from the Latin mos The Latin word mos\u0567mores means the same thing as ethos in Greek. In English, the moral word is translated either by the rules of decency or by a term used to determine the boundaries of another role, the will, the opinion or the limits of action that can rightly be said to be right, wrong, or bad. The word 'moral' is often likened to the word 'ethyl', because both words have the same meaning of habit, custom. Morality is itself: values and norms that hold on to a person or group that govern his behavior. Besides, there's a moral-related word that's a healing word derived from the word 'moral', which is 'moral'. 'Morality' is a moral trait or a whole set of values and values that have to do with good and bad. Thus, the morality of an act means the moral of a deed or the bad of it. Human terms refer to humans or others in actions that have positive values. Humans who lack morals are called immoral means that they are immoral and have no positive value in other human views.

A moral assessment is measured from the culture of the local people. Morality is one's conduct, conduct, or speech in human interaction. If what a person does is in accordance with the values of taste in that society and is acceptable and pleasing to its community, then that person has good morals, and vice versa. Morality is a product of culture and religion. Each culture has different moral standards according to the valid value system and has been awakened for a long time. Self-consistency is a major part of morals. The consistent assessment in morals includes the same constant conformity and sustainability between speech, action. Individuals who have morals must have words and deeds that are consistent. The consistency in morals can be tested through various issues that link words and deeds. This observation of consistency is one that can be observed in politicians when they begin to serve as well as in decision making and the use of power.

Moral values result in a person's guilt or innocence, for he is responsible. Linking to a conscience a characteristic of moral values is the only value that raises a conscience, either accusing, because people underestimate or defy moral values or commend when people manifest their values. An absolute and non-negotiable moral value is that if a person has an aesthetic value, then he will appreciate a quality painting, but other people may not appreciate it. But at moral value, people have to recognize and have to realize. The absolute obligation rests on moral values, because these values apply to human beings.

The tectonic plate is above the astenosphere, a dense layer of coating, but it is not so thick that it can flow and move along with the plate, and it is accompanied by convection patterns in the Earth's coat. Since plate tectonics are moving across the Earth, ocean floors are undermining the main edge of the plate at the convergenial boundary.

The Earth's surface is re-forming during a geologic period of time because of tectonic activity and erosion. The surface of the Earth that is formed or deformation as a result of plate tectonics is a surface that is affected by rainfall, thermal cycles, and chemical influences. Glaciation, coastal erosion, coral reef formation, and impact of large meteorites are some of the events that trigger the re-forming of the Earth's surface landscape. Continent crust consists of materials with low density such as granite and and danesite frozen rocks. Rock with a small percentage is basalt, solid volcanic rock which is the main constituent of the ocean floor. Sediment rocks are formed from the solidified concentration of sediments. Nearly 75% of the surface of the continent is covered by sedimentary rock, although the rock itself forms only 5% of the Earth's crust. The third most common rock found on the Earth's surface is metamorphic rock, formed from the transformation of existing rocks due to high pressure, high temperatures, or both.

The average acidity of the Earth's oceans is 35 grams of salt per kilogram of seawater (3.5% of salt). Much of this salt is produced by volcanic activity or by extraction of frozen rock. The oceans also serve as reservoirs for the soluted atmospheric gases, whose existence is crucial to the survival of most water organisms. Sea water has a huge impact on the world's climate; it serves as a major heat reservoir. The changing temperatures in the oceans can also cause climate changes in various parts of the world, such as the South of El Ni\u00f1o consideroscillation.

Earth's biosphere has slowly checked the composition of the atmosphere. The oxygenic photosynthesis evolved 2.7 billion years ago, which forms the current primary nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere.

The last known phenomenon is the greenhouse effect; the heat capture process emitted from the surface of the Earth in the atmosphere is thus increasing the average temperature. Water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, and ozone are major greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere. Without this heat transmitter, the average temperature on the Earth's surface will reach 18 \u00b0C, different from the average temperature, and life will probably not survive. Earth's atmosphere does not have a definite limit, slowly thinning and dispersing into space. Three quarters of the mass of the atmosphere is at an altitude of 11 kilometers from the Earth's surface. This bottom layer is called the troposphere. The energy from the Sun heats up this layer, as well as the surface beneath it, which causes the expansion of air. The air on this layer then moves up and is replaced by the cold air with higher moisture. As a result, atmospheric circulation triggers the formation of weather and climate through the redistribution of heat energy. The main impact of atmospheric circulation is that the trade winds in the equator are at a 30-degree latitude and west wind in the middle latitudes between 30\u00b0 and 60\u00b0. Ocean currents are also an important factor in determining climate, especially thermohalin circulation that spreads heat energy from the equatorial oceans to polar regions. The water vapor produced through evaporation on the Earth's surface is transported by a pattern of circulation in the atmosphere. As the atmosphere does lift warm and damp air, water vapor will condensate and settle to the surface of the Earth through precipitation.",

This event is called the water cycle, which is an important mechanism to support the survival of life on land and a major factor that causes erosion on the surface of the Earth during the geologic period. The precipitation or rainfall patterns vary greatly, ranging from a few feet [1 m] of water a year to less than a millimeter. The atmospheric, topology, and temperature difference also determine the average rainfall that falls in every region. The magnitude of solar energy reaching the Earth will decrease as latitude increases. At higher latitudes, the sun's light reaches the surface of the Earth at a lower angle and has to pass through a thicker atmospheric column. As a result, the average temperature on sea level drops by about 0.4 \u00b0C per degree to latitude from the equator. Earth can be divided into specific latitude zones based on climate equation estimates. It ranges from the equator to the polar region, the tropical (or equator) climate zone, the subtropical, medium climate, and the polar. The climate can also be classified according to temperature and rainfall, which is marked by climate areas with a uniform air mass. Most commonly used is K\u00f6ppen's climate classification system (tested by Wladimir K\u00f6ppen). This classification divides the Earth into five climate zones, which are then divided into more specific subtypes.

The K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line, calculated 100 kilometers above the Earth's surface, is an imaginary line that limits the atmosphere with space. The heat energy causes some molecules on the outer edge of the Earth's atmosphere to increase its speed so it can escape itself from Earth's gravity. This led to atmospheric leakage into space. Hydrogen, which has lower molecular weight, can reach higher escape speeds and is more likely to leak into space than any other gas. The hydrogen leak into space drives the Earth from its initial reduction to oxidation. Photosynthesis provides free oxygen sources for life on Earth, but the absence of a hydrogen-like agent causes the spread of oxygen in the atmosphere. The ability of hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere has contributed to the growing nature of life on Earth. Today, oxygen-rich atmosphere turns hydrogen into water before it has a chance to break free. Rather, much of the hydrogen release occurred as a result of the destruction of methane in the upper atmosphere. The Earth's magnetic field is thought to be formed because it's polished magnetically, with its magnetic poles at Earth's geographeric poles. At the equator of the magnetic field, the power of the magnetic field on the Earth's surface reaches 3.05 \u00d7 10,5 T, with the moment polished global magnet 7.91 \u00d7 1015 T m3.

Magnetic fields form a magnetic layer, which functions in the solar winds. The edge of the magnetic field that leads to the Sun is about 13 times the radius of Earth. The collision between magnetic fields and solar winds produced Van Allen's radiation belt, a concentric torus - shaped area with energy - laden particles.

From Earth, it would be obvious that the Sun is moving east at a rate of about 1\u00b0/day, which clears the diameter of the Moon or the Earth every 12 hours. Because of this movement, the Earth takes an average of 24 hours (or Sun Day) to complete its full rotation on its axis so that the Sun can return to the meridian. The Earth's average orbital velocity is 29.8 km/s (107,000 km/h), fast enough to travel the same distance as the planet's diameter, or about 12,742 km in seven minutes, and distance to the Moon, 384,000 kilometers in 3.5 hours.

Because of the tilt of the Earth's axis, the amount of sunlight that falls at a certain point on the Earth's surface varies throughout the year. This causes seasons to change in climate. Summer in the northern hemisphere occurs as the North Pole leads directly to the Sun, and winter takes place at the opposite time. When summer, the day lasts longer and the Sun rises higher in the sky. In winter, the climate generally gets colder and the day goes shorter. Above the Arctic Circle, extreme events occur when there are no days and nights lasting more than 24 hours in connection with polar night phenomena. In the southern hemisphere, the situation is opposite to the North Pole; South Pole orientation runs counter to the North Pole. Astronomically, the four seasons are determined by the solstice of the sun's point when the maximum tilt of the axis of orbit is toward or away from the Sun and the equinox, when the slope and direction of the Sun is on a straight vertical line. In the northern hemisphere, the winter solstice occurred on December 21, the summer solstice of June 21, the spring equinox about March 20, and the autumn equinox of September 23.

Both of these movements are caused by a variety of attractions from the Sun and the Moon to the Earth's equatorial bulge. From Earth's point of view, the poles also move a few feet along the surface. The polar movement has several cyclical components, collectively known as the quasiperiodic movement. Besides these components, there is a 14 - month cycle called the Chandler movement. Earth's rotation speeds also vary, known as the phenomenon of long variations of the day. In modern times the perihelion of the Earth occurred about January 3, and aphelion on July 4.

Billions of years later, all water on the Earth's surface will run out and global temperatures will reach 70 \u00b0C (158 \u00b0F). The Earth is estimated to be effective to be inhabited within 500 million years from now, but it may be extended to 2.3 billion years if nitrogen in the atmosphere runs out. Even if the Sun remains and is stable, 27% of the ocean's water will drop into the Earth's coat within a billion years of decreasing steam vents in the middle of the ocean. The sun will evolve into a red giant in about 5 billion years. Sun radius is estimated to be 250 times larger than the current radius, or about 1 SA (150 million km). But the fate of the Earth is still unclear. As the red giant, the Sun will lose mass about 30%. As a result, there are no tidal effects, and the Earth's orbit will move 1.7 SA (250 million km) from the Sun as it reaches its maximum radius. The Earth is expected to protect itself by expanding its outer atmosphere. Nevertheless, life on Earth is still going to die out as a result of rising levels of luminosity of the Sun (at a level of luminosity 5,000 times greater than it is today). Research in 2008 showed that Earth's orbit would be damaged by the effects of tides and the attraction of the Sun, so the Earth would enter the Sun's atmosphere and evaporate as a result of heat. After this event, the core of the Sun will drop into a white word and its outer layer will be spewed out into space into a planetary nebula. Earth matter inside the Sun will be released into interstellar space, which in the future will probably form a new generation of planets and other heavenly bodies.",

Natural satellites orbiting other planets are also called \"months,\" after Earth satellites. The gravitational pull between the Earth and the Moon causes tides to recede on Earth, while the Moon experiences a lockdown of the tide as a result of the same phenomenon; its rotation period is equal to the time it takes to orbit the Earth. Therefore, the Moon always shows the same side to Earth. Because the Moon orbits the Earth, the side of the Moon facing the Earth is illuminated by the Sun, which causes the phase of the moon; the dark side of the Moon does not receive light because it is blocked by the solar Terminator. Because of tidal interaction between the Moon and the Earth, the moon recedes from Earth at approximately 38 mm a year. Over the past millions of years, this phenomenon has caused great changes in long days on Earth. In the Devonian era (about 410 million years ago), one day lasted 21.8 hours. In addition, long days on Earth also increase by some 23 \u25aas a year. The moon has estimated to have affected the development of life by modernizing the climate on Earth. Evidence of paleontology and computer simulations suggest that the tilt of the Earth's axis is stabilized by tidal interactions with the Moon. Some experts believe that without the stabilization of the Sun and other planets of the Earth's equatorial bulge, the rotational axis may be chaotic and unstable for millions of years, as happens on Mars.

The primary value of the idea of existenceists is usually considered freedom, but its highest value is authenticity. In the understanding of an existenceist, an individual begins with what is referred to as \"an existenceal landscape,\" which is a sense of disorientation, confusion, or fear in front of a seemingly meaningless world or absurd. There are also some notable philosophers who view systematic or academic content as too abstract or far from the experience of human concrete. Soren Kierkegaard was generally thought to be the first philosopher of existenceists, although he did not use the term existencealism. He argued that each individual was not a community or religion responsible for giving meaning to life and life, and living that meaning honestly and passionately (\"authentically\"). Existentism became popular after World War II and strongly influenced the fields outside philosophy, including theology, drama, art, literature, and psychology. The term \"existentialism\" was made by a French Catholic philosopher, Gabriel Marcel, in the mid-1940s. At first, when Marcel applied this term to Jean-Paul Sartre in a kkomium in 1945, Sartre refused. Sartre then changed his mind and on October 29, 1945 adopted a public notificational label, in a public lecture delivered to the Maintenant Club in Paris. This public lecture was then published as a very illustrating short book on the idea of existenceist L'existentialism est un humanism.",

Other scientists lengthen this term to Kierkegaard, and others extend it to Socrates. However, this term is often used to refer to the philosophy of Jean-Paul Sartre. The label of existencealism and existenceist is often viewed as an ease of history only because both terms were first used to some philosophers after they had long since died. Although existencealism was generally established by Kierkegaard, the first great philosopher of existenceists to use that term to introduce themselves was Jean-Paul Sartre. Sartre pointed out the idea that \"which all philosophers have is a fundamental doctrine that existence precedes essence\", as Frederick Copleston explained. According to philosopher Steven Crowell, defining existencealism was a bit difficult, and he said that it should be understood as a general approach to rejecting certain systematic philosophy, rather than using it to refer to a systematic philosophy. There's a claim that Kierkegaard adopted the term \"existentialism\" (or at least the term \"existential\" as a description of his philosophy) of the Norwegian poet and literary critic Johan Sebastian Cammermeyer Welhaven. The claim starts with two sources. A Norwegian philosopher, Erik Lundestad, remembers the Danish philosopher Fredrik Christian Sibbern.

The second claim came from Norwegian historian Rune Slagstad, who claimed that Kierkegaard himself said that the term \"existential\" was borrowed from the poet. He strongly believed that Kierkegaard himself said that \"the Hegelian people did not study philosophy in existence; this term I borrowed from Welhaven, with whom I was talking about philosophy.\" Sartre claims that one of the central concepts of existence is that existence precedes essence, which means that the most important consideration for individuals is that they are individual entitys that behave and take responsibility independently and consciously and not labels, roles, stereotypes, definitions, or other categories that are used or used to individual individuals are (\"esence\"). An individual's actual life can then be put together and made their \"real essence,\" and not the essence that others contribute to them. Thus, man, through his own consciousness, creates his own values, and determines the meaning of his own life. Although the first obvious use of this phrase was Sartre, but the same thought could be found in other existenceal philosophers such as Heidegger and Kierkegaard: the subjective form of thought, the form of communication, is his style. It has to be a lot of shapes, as much resistance as it holds. Eins, zwei, the systematic drei is an abstract form that will certainly be difficult to apply into concrete. A subjective thinker must be as concrete as a dialectic shape. However, since he himself was not a poet, not an ethical thinker, not a dialectic, his form was not all direct.",

Background is not a paradise of imagination, where poetry gets its form; nor is it British, where historical accuracy is not at issue. Background is the inner self that exists as a human; concretion is the relationship between one category of existence and another. The accuracy and actuality of history are in one field. S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard. There are those who think that the command to define themselves means one can become anything. However, a philosopher of existenceists would say that such a wish results in an inauthentic existence, called Sartre as a mauvaise foi. That phrase means that humans (1) are defined by their actions and (2) are responsible for their actions. For example, someone who acts badly toward others is defined as a bad person, as his actions indicate. More than that, the person is also responsible for new identities that result from such activities. This is contrary to the attitude of blaming genetics or human nature. As Sartre said in his lecture, existencyalism was a form of humanism: \"Human beings at first existed, aware of their own existence, waking up in the world, after which they define themselves.\" A more positive and predictable aspect of this is also applied this way: one can choose to act differently, can choose to be a good person rather than to be a bad person.",

The way of life like this is called Heidegger as an ordinary day. The concept of absurdism carries the idea that there is no meaning in this world other than what we make ourselves. Including in the absence of meaning is immorality or \"injustice\" of the world. This conceptualization can be viewed in relation to the Jewish-Christian-Islamic perspective, which says that the purpose of life is to obey God's commands. Absurd life means rejecting the life that finds or pursues certain meaning to human presence because nothing can be found. According to Albert Camus, the universe or man is not absurd on its own, but it becomes absurd when both are positioned at each other, when life becomes absurd because humans and the world they live in are not compatible. This view is one of two absurd interpretations that exist in the view of existencealists. The second view, first described by Kierkegaard, says that absurdity is limited to action and human choice. Such actions and choices are absurd because they emerge from human freedom and not from the very foundations of themselves. The absurd concept in existence is contrary to the claim that \"bad things don't happen to good people\"; to the universe, metaphorically, no good people or bad people; what happens, happens, and something bad can happen to bad people or good people.",

In relation to the absence of meaning of the universe this Albert Camus puts his mind to the point that \"there is only one serious philosophy problem, which is suicide\" in the Myth of Sidefus. The cure for the bad consequences of this thought is a lot, from Kierkegaard's scene of religious ties, until Camus thinks that we have to keep fighting in the face of absurdity. Philosophers, though, are eager to help humans avoid a life in which there is always danger of losing all that is meaningful. This danger can lead one to quietism, which is inherently contrary to the philosophy of existenceist. It's said that the possibility of suicide makes all humans existenceal. A real absurd hero lives without meaning and faces suicide without suicide. Factivity is a concept defined by Sartre in Being and Nothingness as its own inner-self, which distinguishes the human capitality between being and not being. It's easy to understand when the fact of authenticity is viewed in relation to our past temporal dimension: a person's past is someone's existence because it helps make a person's past. But we cannot say that a person is just his past because that means that we ignore most of the facts (now, present and future); on the other hand, if we say that one's past no longer applies now, it's the same as not referring to that person today.",

The same applies to other kinds of factisity (for example, a human has a human body that can't outrun the speed of sound ID, values, etc.) Facity is the limitation and value of freedom. Restrictions because most of human factivities are things that cannot be changed (place of birth, etc. ), but also the determining value of freedom because one's views are likely to depend on that fact. However, even though a person's factivity is \"inculcated in stone\" (e. g. in the past), it still can't define a person; one can still assess his factisticity, and the values it's given in fact, freely. To illustrate: Imagine two humans, the first man had no memory of his past, and the second man remembered his past. They've done many evils, but the first man who knew nothing of his forgetfulness, lived a normal life; the second man, who felt trapped in his past, went on living a life of crime and blamed his past for having trapped him in such a life. There was nothing essential about his criminal behavior, but he gave meaning to the past. However, if a person doesn't care about inactivity when projecting himself in the future, it's as good as rejecting himself and is equally inauthentic. The beginning of one's projection still needs to remain based on factivity, even though it is not in fashion to be essentially factistic. For example, consider a person who focuses on projects that may happen in the future without regard for the fact of the fact that it's going on: someone who constantly thinks about the future associated with wealth (i.e.",

Another aspect of the fact that factivity leads to anxiety, either when freedom \"creates\" anxiety when it is restricted in fact, and when there's no possibility of \"guilty\" activity for something that one should be accountable for. Another aspect of existenceal freedom is that a person can change the values he holds. Thus, a person is responsible for the values he holds, regardless of the values that society holds. The focus of freedom in existence is linked to the limits of responsibility held by one person as a result of his freedom: between freedom and responsibility lies a relationship that depends on one another. The clarifyation of freedom also clarifys one's responsibilities. Many notable authors put the theme of authentic existence first. The main concept is that one must \"create oneself\" and live according to this self. In acting, one must act as one's own, not as \"a person's action\" or \"a person's gene\" or any other essence. An authentic act is an act that contributes to one's freedom. The value of freedom is inclusion, including self-flactivity, but factivity remains unable to determine a person's transcendent choice. The role of factivity in relation to authenticity is to allow one's values to \"play\" when making a choice (and not \"choose\" at random).",

There are many forms, for example, by saying that choice is meaningless or random, by convincing yourself that there is a true form of determinism, until it's kind of \"mimicry,\" when someone acts as if \"he has to\" The \"must\" of a person in action is determined by the shadow that the person has related to the action he considers to be done (e.g. the role of bank manager, circus performer, sex worker, etc.) In the absence and absence (English: Being and Nothingness), Sartre describes the example of a \"Cafeb waiter\" who was in the mauvaise foi: he only played a role as a caf\u00e9 waiter, although the role play was very convincing. Normally, these images relate to certain social norms, but this does not mean that all behaviors that conform to social norms are not authentic. The primary interest is one's attitude toward freedom and responsibility, as well as the extent of one's being aware of one's own freedom. Liyan is another concept that is usually included in the phenomenology and in the intersubjectivity concepts it has. However, this concept is also widely used in the writings of existenceists, and the conclusions found in its use by existencealists are somewhat different from those of phenomenology. Liyan's experience is another experience of free subjects who are in the same world as one person.

Although this experience in the sense of phenomenologists basically established the world as an objective matter, as well as yourself as an objective subjectivity (a person experiences himself as seen in Liyan's view in the same way that the Liyan experienced as a subjectivity), in existencealism the view also acts as a sort of restriction of freedom. This is because the view tends to indicate what it sees. For example, when a person experiences himself in the View, a person does not experience himself as nothing but as something. The example Sartre gave was someone who peered through the keyhole; at first, the man who peered into the room was completely focused on the situation inside the room and he was in a pre-reflexive state and directed his consciousness to what was going on in the room. Suddenly, he heard a voice indicating that there was someone behind him, and then he realized that he was being looked at by the Liyan. He then felt ashamed because he would judge himself as he would judge someone peeping through a keyhole. This view then helps to establish a person's identity.

This anxiety is usually defined as a negative feeling that emerges from human experience of freedom and responsibility. The example of anxiety archetypal is an experience that a person normally has when standing on a cliff; that person fears not only that he will fall but also that he is afraid of dropping himself. In this experience, when a person feels \"nothing limits me\", someone feels that there is nothing to determine whether he should jump or stand still, and that's when he feels that he's free. In existencealism, despair is generally defined as despair. Specifically, despair is a desperate reaction to a loss or many traits that define one's self or identity. If a person wants to be something, such as a bus driver or a good citizen, and the person realizes that his identity is damaged in some way, he will usually have a desperate situation. For example, a singer who is no longer capable of singing will feel desperate if there is nothing else he can do. There's nothing more to his identity. He can't afford to be what defines him. What separates the conception of hopelessness from the general definition is that the hopelessness of existencealism is a condition that people experience even when they're not in deep despair.

Denial of common sense as a source of meaning is a concept that is constantly repeated in the thought of existencealism, such as focusing on the anxiety and fear that we feel before our own radical freedom and our awareness of death.

According to Sartre, people gather themselves behind everyday realities to try to relieve anxiety and fear. This led them to free themselves and enter the prison of the Liyan View. The reading of the Biblical's existence should be based on the reader's ability to realize that he is a subject that treats those words as a kind of memory of events that occurred in the past. This contrasts with reading the Bible as a collection of \"the truth\" that is outside and is not related to the reader but is performing a kind of sense of reality or faith. The reader was not obliged to follow those orders as if an external agent were forcing them to go on, but to read as if they were in those Bible stories and those stories helped them from the inside. Kierkegaard asked: \"Who is the more difficult task: the teacher who teaches things about how far a meteor is from real life, or a student who has to use that science?\" Although nihilism and existencealism are two different philosophys, people often equate it with error. This error was largely due to Friedrich Nietzsche being an important philosopher in both areas. In addition, it is also common to emphasize that there is no meaning to life.

In the end, Kierkegaard still believes that individual should live up to his own ideas. The first literary writer that mattered to existencealism was a Russian writer named Fyodor Dostoyevsky. Dostoyevsky's underground records describe a man who failed to connect with society and was unhappy with the identity he created for himself. Jean-Paul Sartre, in his book Existentialism, is a form of Humanism, quoting the Karamazov Brothers of Dostoyevsky as one of the examples of the existenceal crisis. Sartre contributed Ivan Karamazov's claim: \"If God does not exist, then all things are allowed\" to Dostoyevsky, although this quote doesn't actually appear in the novel. However, there was a similar sentiment when Alyosha met Dimitri in prison. Dimitri mentioned his conversation with Rakitin, when he said, \"Then, if God does not exist, then man is the king of the earth, the king of the universe,\" which justifies Sartre's reference to the idea in the novel. Another Dostoyevsky novel deals with an issue that confronts the philosophy of existenceists while providing a different line of story with secular existencealism: for example, in Crime and Punishment, the protagonist, Raskolnikov, faced an existenceal crisis and moved toward a position of Orthodox Christianity closer to which Dostoyevsky advocated. In the early decades of the 20th century, some philosophers and writers explored the ideas of existencealists. The Spanish philosopher Miguel de Unamuno y Jugo, in his book (the 1913) entitled The Tragic Sense of Life in Men and Nations, stressed the life of \"bones and meats\" that are opposed to the life of abstract rationalism.

Another Spanish writer, Ortega y Gasset, wrote in 1914, emphasizing that human existence should always be understood as a human individual combined with the concrete situation of life: \"Yo soy yo y mi circunstancia\" (In Indonesia: \"I am myself and my situation\").

Although Martin Buber wrote his great work of philosophy in German, and studied and taught at the University of Berlin and Frankfurt, he was different from the main stream of German philosophy. He was born to a Jewish family in Vienna in 1878, and he was a Jewish cultural scientist and was often involved in the movements of Zionism and Hasidism. In 1938 he moved permanently to Jerusalem. His best - known philosophy was I and Thou, published in 1922. For Buber, the fundamental fact of human existence is \"human beings with men,\" the dialogue that goes on in \"space between\" (\"das Zwischenmenschliche\"). This fundamental fact is rarely noticed by scientific rationalism and abstract philosophical thinking. Two Russian thinkers, Lev Shestov and Nikolai Berdyaev, became known as the thinkers of existenceists when they were being banished to post-revolution Paris. Shestov was born to a Ukrainian Jewish family in Kiev, and in 1905 attacked rationalism and systematic philosophy in his aphorism book, everything is possible.

Gabriel Marcel, long before using the term \"existentialism,\" had introduced important economicism themes to French audiences, in his initial essay, Existence and Objectivity (1925) and in his Metaphysic journal (1927). Marcel who was a dramaturg and philosopher found its starting point in metaphysical alienation, a human individual who sought harmony in his temporary life. Harmony, for Marcel, can be achieved through a secondary reflection, an approach to \"dialogical\" and not \"dialectic\" to the world, with the existence of \"nervousness and fear\" and openness to \"existence\" of others and God, and instead of responding to the outside is just \"information.\" For Marcel, such existence was more implicating than just being present somewhere (just as something could possibly exist in the presence of another). His existence was connotations of extraordinary existence and a desire to sacrifice himself for others. Marcel countered \"simplit reflection\" with \"private reflection\" abstract, scientific and technical, which he associated with the activities of abstract Cartesian ego. For Marcel, philosophy was a concrete activity carried out by the incarnation of humans who were able to sense and feel in a concrete world.

In Germany, psychologists and philosophers Karl Jaspers \u25aa who later referred to existencealism as a kind of \"ghost\" created by the public called his thinking, which was deeply influenced by Kierkegaard and Nietzsche, as Existenzphilosphee. For Jaspers, \"Existenz-philosphy is a kind of thinking that a man can use to be himself... this mindset doesn't realize an object, but it stimulates and activates the existence of a thinker. Jaspers, who was a professor at Heidelberg University, knew Martin Heidegger, who held the position of professor at Marburg before taking Husserl's position in Freiburg in 1928. They had a lot of philosophical discussions, but then walked away because Heidegger supported Nazism. They both admired Kierkegaard, and in the 1930s, Heidegger gave a lot of lectures about Nietzsche. The extent to which Heidegger can be called an existenceist is debatable. In Being and Time, he provided a method of negativity and analysis of human existence (Dasein) by means of an existenceal category, and this made him known for its importance in the movement of existenceists. After World War II, existencealism became an important and well - known movement of philosophy and culture, especially after the fame of two French writers, Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus, who wrote novels and plays sold out and journalism and the theoretical text that many people read. In these years the book Heidegger, Being and Time, outside Germany, has increased. Sartre discussed the theme of existenceist in his novel, Nausea, released in 1938, and some short stories in his collection released in 1939 entitled The Wall. He also published his writings on existencealism, Being and Nothingness, in 1943, but only two years later, after the release of Paris from the German ocupation Army, his name became internationally known as leader of the existencealism movement, along with three close friends Camus, Simone de Beauvoir, and Maurice Merleau-Ponty, dkk.",

Beauvoir wrote that \"not a week goes by without papers discussing us.\" Existencyalism became \"the first warm media cycle in the postwar era.\" By the end of 1947, early works of fiction and drama Camus had been reprinted, his new Caligula script had been played, and his novel The Plague was published; the first two novels in the trilogy of The Roads to Freedom were also published, as was the novel de Beauvoir, The Blood of Others. The works by Camus and Sartre began to appear in foreign editions. These French philosophers of existenceists began to become famous. Sartre left for Germany in 1930 to study the phenomenology of Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger. His great book, Being and Nothingness, also contains critical comments on the works of Husserl and Heidegger. Heidegger's thinking also became known in the French philosophy circle for using Alexandre Koj\u00e8ve to explain Hegel in a series of lectures in Paris in 1930. The lectures were very influential; the audiences were not only Sartre and Merleau-Ponty, and Raymond Queneau, Georges Bataille, Louis Althusser, Andr\u00e9 Breton, and Jacques Lacan.

Your work shows a very quick understanding of my philosophy, and I've never seen this before.\" Then, however, in an answer to a question posed by his French disciple Jean Baufret, Heidegger withdrew from Sartre's position and existence in general about Humanism as he wrote. Heidegger's reputation continued to rise in France in the 1950s and 1960s. In the 1960s, Sartre tried to combine existencealism and Marxism in his work, the Critics for Dilectic Concise. The theme that keeps repeating in his writings is about freedom and responsibility. Camus was Sartre's friend until they split up. He also wrote several historical works, including The Rebel, Summer in Algeria, Cesphos, and Stranger Myth. This last book is an existenceal novel that is often exemplary. Camus, like many other authors, rejects the label of existenceists; he considers the theme of his work to be man's dealing with absurdity. Simone de Beauvoir, an important existenceist who spent her life as a Sartre couple, wrote about feminist ethics and existenceist in her work, The Second Sex and The Ethics of Ambiguity. Although it was often not viewed for its relationship with Sartre, de Beauvoir integrated existencealism in other ways like feminism. At the time, this was still not often heard, and much was excommunicated from other writers such as Camus. Paul Tillich was an important theologian of existenceist Kierkegaard and Karl Barth. He applied the concept of an existenceist to Christian theology and began to introduce an existenceal theology to the public.

Maurice Merleau-Ponty, an existenceal fenomenologist, was a friend of Sartre. Merleau-Ponty's work Fenomenology Perception (1945) was once regarded as a major statement of French existencealism. It is said that Merleau-Ponty's work entitled Humanism and Terror influenced Sartre greatly. Yet, they then argued warmly, which separated the existencealists into various fortifications. De Beauvoir, for example, took up a position of agreement with Sartre. Colin Wilson, an English writer, published his work entitled The Outsider in 1956. At first, the work was warmly accepted. In this book and some other works (such as New Existinctional Intimacy), he tries to revive what he considers to be a pessimist philosophy and take it to a larger audience. However, he was not trained academically and his work was attacked by professional philosophers because he was taken seriously and did not reach critical standards. Stanley Kubrick's antiwar film in 1957, Paths of Glory, \"drawing, and even illuminating, existencealism\" by investigating \"absurdity of real human condition\" and \"war terror.\" It told of a fictitious French army regiment in World War I that was ordered to attack an impenetrable German formification.

Eliot, Herman Hesse, Luigi Pirandello Ralph Ellison, and Jack Kerouac, wrote literature or poetry containing elements of realistic thinking or proto-existential thinking. The influence of this philosophy even reached the work of pop literature right at the beginning of the 21st century, such as the lack of human control over the fate discussed in H.P. works. Lovecraft. Since the late 1960s, there's been a lot of literary cultural activity that contains postmodernis and existenceal elements.

Jean-Paul Sartre wrote No Exit (French: 'Huis Clos'; English: No Exit) in 1944, a theater text that was a popular quote source: \"Hell is someone else.\" (In French: \"L'enfer, c'est les autres.\") The script begins with a Valet who escorts someone into a room that the audience soon realizes is hell.

Samuel Beckett, who was once asked who Godot was, said, \"If I had known, I would have said it in the script.\" To eliminate boredom, both men eat, sleep, talk, argue, sing, play, exercise, swap hats, and think of any suicide \"to keep that torture quiet doesn't come close.\" The script \"fronts several forms and situations of archetipal, all of which convey comedy and pathos.\" The play also describes the attitude toward human experience in the universe: sadness, oppression, friendship, hope, corruption, and confusion of human experiences that can only be reconciled in the mind and in the art of the absurd.

Critic Martin Esslin, in his book \"Teater Absurd,\" points out that many contemporary dramaturgs like Samuel Beckett, Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco, Jean Genet, and Arthur Adamov put the belief in the existencealist that we are the absurd creatures living in an empty and meaningless universe into his works. Esslin showed that many dramaturgs demonstrate the power of philosophy better than the works of Sartre and Camus. Despite many of the dramaturgs, which are then labeled \"Absurdis\" (in the book Esslin), rejects the label of existencealism and is often highly antifilsaphate (for example, Ionesco often claims that he is closer to pataphysics or surrealism than by Esslin), these dramaturtics often relate to existencealism. One of the great effects of existencealism as a philosophy is psychology and psychoanalysisist, which was first crystallized in the work of Otto Rank, a colleague of Sigmund Freud for 20 years. Ludwig Binswanger, unaware of Otto Rank's existence, was also deeply affected by Freud, Edmund Husserl, Heidegger, and Sartre. Another important figure was Viktor Frankl, who met Freud and studied with Jung in his youth. His logotherapy can be considered as an existenceal therapy.

Anxiousness is so important in existencealism that it becomes a popular topic in psychotherapy. The therapists love to give the philosophy of existenceists an explanation of anxiety. The claim is that anxiety arises in the absolute freedom of an individual to choose and render an individual's absolute responsibility for that choice. Psychotherapists who use the approach to existenceists believe that a patient can use his anxiety constructively. Instead of suppressing anxiety, patients are advised to use such anxiety as a basis for change. If a person realizes that anxiety is inevitable, then he can achieve his full potential. Humanistic psychology also has a huge impetus of existenceal psychology and a lot of understanding. The theory of terror management, based on the writings of Ernest Becker and Otto Rank, is a growing field in the academic study of psychology. It's trying to investigate what scientists call an implicit emotional reaction that appears to people who are faced with the fact that they will one day die. Gerd B. Achenbach also reanimated the Socratic tradition with his own methods, philosophical counseling. Walter Kauffman criticized \"a very vague method, and a dangerous hatred for the use of common sense, which is so evident in existencealism.\" Logical positist philosophers, such as Rudolf Carnap and A. J. Ayer, claim that existenceists are often confused about verba to be in their analysis of being. In particular, they say that the verba is transitive and it's predicated on predicates (for example, an apple \"is red\") with no predicate, the word is meaningless, and the existencealists often abuse that term.",

So gerontologically it can be defined as a science of the elderly (lansia). While this definition may sound simple and brief, it has extensive coverage because the aging problem is reversed by various factors and aspects and affects many areas and facets of life. Hence, Gerontologists (Groontologists) have a background in a wide variety of disciplines. They are researchers and practitioners in biology, medicine, psychology, criminology, sociology, economics, anthropology, laws, social politics and other disciplines. Gerontologists apply the knowledge and knowledge they have to help older ones live a good, prosperous, happy life. They provide training for the elderly; they educate the general public to contribute to and facilitate the elderly, to keep them active and productive; to do counseling on good ways to care for the elderly; to advocate public policy that commercializes the rights of the elderly and creates laws that ensure protection for the elderly. The term gerontology (Groontology) was first introduced by a Russian scientist, Ilya Ilyich Mechniko about 1903. Mechniko used that term to refer to the studies he produced through scientific research to understand aging. However, long before Mechaniko was born, the aging process had become a topic of discussion, study and learning material for thinkers but with less scientific approaches in terms of modern discipline. Aristotle, for example, more than 2000 years ago on numerous occasions has raised the topic of life expectancy and the theory of aging of various species of living beings.

Galen (129-216 C.E.) in his book De Sanitate Tuenda explains that the process of aging lasts a lifetime, from the time of conception to death. Gelenment explains the aging process as a result of the heat imbalance that each organism will experience. The body temperature will get more and more desired from time to time. Whereas the right body temperature is vital for producing tissue and organs. Unlike Galen, Roger Bacon (1220-1292 C.E.) in his book Opus Magi reflects the short death and life of human beings in the framework of Christian faith. He explained that a short human life span is an act of action, so it is open to fix it. Roger Bacon explains that humans can be hundreds of years old, but because of man's fall in sin (eden events) the life span is shortened. It is, according to him, proven by the eternal human soul. Moreover, according to Roger Bacon, the decline in life also occurs because humans are insensitive to hiegenity factors. Next Francis Bacon of the Renaissance seriously reviewed human life in his History of Life and Death and gave some advice on coping with a drop in body strength in order to prolong life span.

When a white blood cell that works to keep its immune system from getting less ill, then the human body's resistance will become weak. The aging process occurs because the immune system decreases as the number of white blood cells is eaten by microbs. This find came to be called the theory of phagocytes. Elie Metchnikoff's findings are considered to be a vital milestone in understanding the human immune system. Thanks to his services, Elie Metnikoff was awarded a Nobel Prize in 1908. In studies on aging, Metnikoff is also considered to have a large service because his theories about micro-bacterials and immune systems are an essential basis for understanding aging. He was also considered a pioneer of the term Gerontology. During the same period, Michel Eug\u00e8ne Chevreul, a French chemist, coined the idea that Gerontology could stand alone as a discipline. The idea was recently analyzed about 1940 by James Birren. He saw a lot of experts from different disciplines trying to solve aging problems. He was therefore moved to organize experts of various disciplines in a container that specializes in the study of aging. The first association in Gerontology was formed in America in 1945 under the name the American Gerontological Community (Gerontologicala Society of America). Twenty years later, James Birren pioneered the establishment of an academic research center on aging called Ethel Percy Andrus Gerontology Center at the University of South of California.",

This is America's first professor of gerontology (also in the world) that later provided a PhD in the field of Gerontology. After that other universities started providing invoices of Gerontological Schools or study of aging in academic spheres. The aging process doesn't just happen as a natural symptom. Today it is increasingly realized that the aging process is accumulating of various factors and qualities of life for the elderly is determined by these factors. Gerontology was present to study those factors comprehensively and try to find a solution so that the aging process did not cause the degradation of human quality of life. Hence, the object of the study of Gerontology is vast and varied. More specifically, some studies and work spheres of gerontologists in relation to the above - mentioned disciplines can be detailed: In general, the scope of Gerontology studies can be divided into 4 according to the approach of your used sciences: Social Gerontology, Bigerontology, Medical Gerontology (Geriatry) and Gerotechnology. Social gerontology uses the approach to sociology, anthropology, economics, psychology and some other humaniora science to understand the aging process and its impact and solution in a community. Biogerontology is a discipline that studies the biological processes that occur in aging. The focus of biogerontology studies is the physical changes that older people experience according to their biological development. Physical or biological features indicate a person's body function. In the cycle or stages of living things changes in physical functions must occur as they age more and more; in the stages of youth the function of the body develops so well that until the adult stage; in adulthood, one is experiencing the peak of all of its biological functions; but in the final stage, age, the function of the body will experience a decline.",

The focus of the study discussed in medical gerontology is that older health corresponds to its biological development. The ilum dysplin closely related to medical gerontology, a new science discovered in 1935 in England, was geriatric. Geriatri comes from the word gerios, which means old age and lateria, which means caring. One of the focus of learning in geriatrics is on the cause of disease, which is called ethyology. Paralansia generally suffers defunctions caused by endogenous factors (from the inside of the body) and exogenous factors (the outside of the body). With body functions such as enzymes, cells, and immunes, exogenous factors can easily cause disease in the elderly. These relationships are studied in ethyology. Gerotechnology studies the elderly and their relationship with technological development. This approach is the latest science that describes the extent to which technology develops for the elderly. Advanced technological advances provide opportunities or opportunities for the elderly to develop themselves. Gerotechnology is actually practical science to make it easier for older people to use tools and infrastructure that correspond to technology's development and advancement. Suppose, the ease of governmental service for older people can use tools and technological infrastructure such as cell phones or design homes that are habitable for the elderly and use of other special tools, the advanced technological application of the elderly will support them at the same time put them independently in running their old age. There are many theories about aging. Each theory has its advantages and weaknesses. There is not a single theory that is accepted by all parties, and made of it the absolute truth.",

        "paragraph": "Scientists are using not always the same approach in their efforts to unravel the mystery of aging. These different approaches also result in different theories, even some of them opposites. These theories can be divided into two categories: biology theory and psychotic theory. According to genetic theory, the aging process is programmed in each individual's genes because in the genes the age of each cell of the body has been set. This theory is based on an opoptosis law discovered in 1842 by a German scientist, Carl Vogh. The law of opoptosis reveals that each cell will undergo morphological changes and then die. In the nucleus of each body cell is an information code that commands for the morphological change. This process is known as programmed cell death (programmed cell death) which takes place because of a system called \u25aabiological clocks in each individual's genes. Cell death as determined in the gene triggers aging. The faster and more cells die, the faster the aging process takes place. Environmental factors and genetic mutations can affect genes in determining the age of each cell and thus accelerate the aging process. The theory wear and tear was first introduced in 1882 by Dr. August Weismann, a German biologist. He describes the function and properties of cells, tissues and organs (body) by comparison with machines. The more time a machine is used, the less good it will be until it is completely damaged and can no longer be fixed. The same is true with cells, tissues and organs that are vital parts of living things. The constant use of the body's organs causes damage both because of internal factors and because of external factors (water and bad food, viruses, cigarettes, nonconductive temperatures and so on).",

        "paragraph": "I started out with these damages, coupled with fatigue factors, causing cells not to reproduce, so one by one, tissue and damaged organs can't be fixed. It triggers a drop in the body's organs until at some point it can't function and reproduce again. Accumulation theory explains that aging is caused by a decrease in organ function due to the buildup of disruptive elements in the body. The elements are partly from the outside and into the body; some of the rest of the cell metabolism. The latest accumulated theory was produced by Dr. Aubrey de Grey, an inngrising gerontologist, who described aging as a consequence of accumulating 7 damage to molecular levels, cells and intra cells. Free radicals are atoms or molecules that have electrons that don't pair in their outer orbit and can stand on their own. Radical free as a toxic agent in the body of a living creature was first triggered by Rebecca Gerschman, an Argentine scientist in 1954. The idea was then explored by Denham Harman, an American biogerontologist in 1956. In his theory Denham Harman revealed that Radicallfree was a chemical compound containing electrons that did not pair up. Such free radicals form as byproducts of normal cellular processes or metabolism involving oxygen. As contonh is reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) produced during normal metabolism. Since its electrons aren't in pairs, it's chemically radically free of other electronic pairs by reacting with other substances, especially proteins and fats are not saturated. Through oxidation, free radicals produced during oxidative phosphorasole can produce various modifications of macromoleculle. For example, because cell membranes contain a number of fats, they can react radically freely so that cell membranes change.",

        "paragraph": "As a result of the changes in the membrane structure, the cell membrane becomes more permeable to some substance and allows it to pass through the membrane freely. The structure inside cells like mitochondria and lisosome are also covered with membranes that contain fat so easily disturbed by free radicals. Free radicals can also react with DNA, causing chromosomal mutations and therefore damaging the genetic machines of the cell. Free radicals can damage cell function by damaging cell membranes or cell chromosomes. Furthermore, the radical free theory states that there is a gradual buildup of radical freedom in the cell in time and if the rate exceeds the concentration of threshold then they may contribute to the changes associated with aging. This theory was developed by two social scientists, Elaine Cumming and William Henry about 1960. They published an important work called \u25aa Became Old in 1961. The work was based on studies conducted by researchers from the University of Chicago, using data collected by the University of Kansas in the study of the lives of parents. The study involved hundreds of older men and women. The conclusion of the study revealed that older people tend to withdraw from society, a social environment where they are usually involved even the community they love the most, before they die. To explain this theory more specifically, Cumming and Henry are human behavior patterns from infancy. As babies go to childhood, humans tend to seek the attention of others. After teenagers and adults humans demand freedom and independence. At the end of man's adult years return to unfree state, independent (depends on others). First we lose physical independence.",

        "paragraph": "Then we lose social interest and then withdraw from the world around us. Those are the stages of life that are the footstool of Cumming and Henry's argument in this theory. As the aging process occurs and realizes that their lifespan is near, the elderly slowly separate themselves from social ties to the remaining social bonds that are very important, that must be maintained by their lives. The loss of the ability to become a member of society becomes the focus of this theory. Eventually, in the process the elderly were finally willing to accept death. This theory has many criticisms and rejections because it also assumes that involvement in social life is not good for older people. The theory of activity was developed by J. Havigrust, a Gerontologist in 1961 and was initially presented as a response to the theory of isolation that was recently published at the time. According to this theory, older ones will be happier if they remain active and engage in social interactions. The activities of older ones, especially meaningful activities, will help them to find replacements for lost roles after retirement and help overcome their limitations in social interaction. This theory is viewed as more positive and accepted more widely compared with the theory of isolation. However, this theory is considered incomplete because of the health and economic factors in it. And yet both factors are very important to determine whether older people can follow the activities of staying active as suggested in this theory. Also, some older ones don't want to get involved in new challenges. The aging process is going faster if the adaptation stage is low in the environment. On the other hand, the aging process will occur naturally (60s of years) in order to determine the level of individual interaction with its environment.",

Empirism is one of three streams of scientific philosophy in the Western world. The philosophy of empirism has traits that conflict with rationalism. The thought of empirism was pioneered by Thomas Hobbes as a reaction to rationalism. The development of empirism took place in Britain and its surrounding region during the renaissance during the 17th to the 18th century. Empirism was first developed in England by John Locke (1632 (1632\u25aa1704), but it influenced more thinking figures in the United States, especially in environmental preservation and environmental psychology.

Then another idea of empirism was brought up by John Locke (1632 JULI1704) who suggested that the source of knowledge accepted by reason comes from experience. The idea of empirism was developed again by George Berkeley that argues that materialities don't exist at all, that there are only observable traits. When the world entered the age of the Industrial Revolution, humans began to rely on science and technology to establish a policy on solving social problems in society. The mysticism and belief in clenics and magic have begun to be abandoned by society. Social problems began to be solved by drafting and testing various scientific theories. The measures used are empirical and scientific methods. The basic teachings of empirism can be divided based on his view of the source of knowledge, the method of thinking and the model of reasoning used. The source of knowledge in empirism is only from experience. The method of thinking he used was through empirical evidence and experiments. The model of reasoning he used was inductive reasoning. The teaching of empirism is contrary to rationalism, since rationalism considers the recognition of knowledge by senses to be vague. While empirism believes that the senses are the most perfect and clear tools of knowledge. In another sense, empirism puts the use of the 'teriori element first, while rationalism puts the use of the apriori element first.

Empirism believes that the whole structure of science can be known to use induction methods. The theory of correspondence is a theory that offers that knowledge can be true and can be true when it conforms to reality. An idea, a concept or a theory is only viewed as true when it conforms to reality. Revealing reality is the main thing, for truth will be revealed naturally after reality has been revealed.

Thomas Hobbes argues that the introduction to everything is always preceded by the experience of the senses. Truth belongs only to something that the senses can sense. He believes that intellectual recognition is the result of the summation of the same senses data, but in different ways. Hobbes viewed matter systems as world and matter as objects of recognition. The presence of an introvertial object is ongoing due to the laws of mechanisms. In the history of modern philosophy, Hobbes ' thinking was the first materialistic system. David Hume is one of Britain's empirism characters. The empirical thinking she presented was radical. He interprets the substance of knowledge as a repetition of experience so that the whole knowledge is a total experience. David Hume's view tends to be skeptical because he only recognizes the results of knowledge by his senses widely. He viewed experience as a mere fantasy and preconceived. In modern science, the normative law is separated from empirical law. This normative law is defined as a link between man and God. This condition makes modern science free of value and neutrality.

Sensational recognition and observation were then used in positivism for knowledge recognition in research.

Observations of empirical facts are carried out in order to reach conclusions that can be used to verify the truth of a statement.

DVD also gives companies a cheap way to provide business and product information on video in full through direct mail delivery. As soon as the standard united formal adoption for the DVD, two of the four leading video games consoles (Sega and The 3DO Company) said that they had a plan to design a gaming console with DVDs as a medium source. Sony stated at the time that they had no plans to use DVDs in their gaming console system, even though Sony was now one of the developers of DVD formats, and then eventually Sony became the first company to actually release a DVD-based console. Game consoles such as PlayStation 2, Xbox, and Xbox 360 use DVDs as medium sources for games and other software. Modern games for Windows are also distributed in the form of DVDs. Early DVD was created using DLT tapes, but the use of DVD-R DL or +R DL was eventually common.

The disc two sides identify its sides as A and B. The disk structure lacks a blank layer so that the identification label is printed on the disc on one side, so information like the title is printed on one or on two sides in the non-data clamp of the zone in the middle of the disk. Typical DVD-10 is not very popular because unlike two-layer discs, two-sided discs (DVD-10) require users to manually reverse it to access complete content (screenarios relatively horrible for DVD movies), while DVD-10 offers trivial benefits such as capacity. Outside of its excess capacity, DVD-10 has proved to be more difficult to treat and save.

This DVD-9 disc (Type C in ISO) has almost doubled the disc capacity of DVD-5 with nominal is 8.5 GB, but DVD-9 is below the overall capacity of DVD-10 disks because of the difference in the physical data structure of additional recording layers.

The printed message that wants to be delivered to explain that there is a layer transition pause is not a standard malfunction written in a DVD storage box. During mastering, a studio can make a deliberate transition less obvious by setting the time right before changing camera angles or any other sudden change, the earliest example is the release of Toy Story DVD. Then on the way to the DVD format, larger data buffers and faster optical pickups on the DVD player can make effective layer transition invisible without needing mastering. Double-layed DVDs are recorded using Opposite Track Path (OTP) techniques. Most double-layed disks do mastering with layers of 0 that start from the inner diameter and continue to the outside just as much as most of the optical media that escapes the number of layers while Layer 1 begins at the absolute outer diameter and continues inward. In addition, data tracks are played in such a way that the disc spins in the same direction to read both layers. DL video DVD discs can do mastering a little differently: single media streams can be divided between layers like layers 1 beginning at the same diameter as the end of layer 0. This modification can reduce the visible layer transition pause because after re-focusing, the laser stays in place, thus reducing additional time loss while crossing the remaining disk diameter.",

Lutesium is a mixture of white and silver metals that withstand corrosion and include rare produce of the earth. Lutesium is the strongest and densest metal in the lantanda class located in the last column of the class at the periodic table. Lutesium was first discovered in 1907 by Baron Carl Auer von Welsbach, Georges Urbain, and Charles James when each one of them did research in a different place. They study minerals that are thought to be pure consisting of iterbium, but eventually it's known that the mineral is also a combination of lutesium and some other chemical elements. Since Georges Urbain took a quick step forward to publicize his discovery, then the naming of the chemical element as the elected and officially recognized globally. Lutesium has atom number 71 and electron configuration Xe ] 4f145d16s2. Lutesium is resistant to corrosion and mixed color between white and silver. The lluted atomic mass is large enough compared with its size, so the lutesium has a boiling point and a high melting point. Actually the electrons of the lutesium element don't fully fill the d orbital, but they remain classified into lantanide because they have physical and chemical characteristics that are very similar to 14 other lanttanide chemicals. Lutesium has 59 isotopes, but there are only two stable isotopes, which are Lu-175 and Lu-176. 97.41% of the total lutesium found on the face of the earth is Lu-175, while only 2.59% is Lu-176. Though less abundant and radioactive, the Lu-176 element survived for 4x10 years. In real life, the lutesium can be obtained from minerals containing a mixture of lutesium and other lantanidic chemicals.",

From the process of forming, the type of rock is distinguished into frozen rock, sedimentic rock, and metamorphic rock. Stones are generally classified based on mineral and chemical composition, with the texture of particle elements and by the process that shapes them. These features classify rock to frozen, sediment, and metamorphic. They're more classified based on the size of the particles that make them up. Transformation from one kind of rock to another is described by a geological model. This class is based on: frozen rock is a rock formed from lava cooling that then freezes. Frozen rocks can be found in the earth's stomach as well as on the earth's surface. Frozen rock can be distinguished into plutonic rock and volcanic rock. Plutonic rocks form from the cooling of magma in the Earth's crust and crystallization slowly. One example of plutonic rock is granite. Volcanic rock was formed through a magma freeze on the surface of the earth while it was still lava-shaped. Samples of volcanic rock are pumice and basalt. Frozen rocks contain silicates and gases derived from magma. The number of crystal magmas formed into frozen rock is affected by the freezing site of the magma. The closer to the earth's surface, the fewer the crystal magma will be. The transfer of magma crystals is influenced by convection currents that move the magma to rupture, czar, or layering fields. Lacking the amount of magma crystallized on the earth's surface is due to the rapid cooling process. Frozen rocks on the earth's surface have ruptures and gas holes so it's easier to decay.",

According to the ancient myth, Hercules passed through Monaco and banished the former gods. As a result, a temple was built there, the temple of Hercules Monoikos. Because the only temple in this area is Hercules' house, this city is called Monoikos. After the burial of the land of Emperor Henry VI in 1191, Monaco was rebuilt in 1215 as the Genoa colony. Monaco was first ruled by the Grimaldi House in 1297, when Francesco Grimaldi, known as \"Il Malizia\" (translated from Italian either as \"the dangerous one\" or \"the cunning one\"), and his men captured the Monako Stone fort and dressed as a Monasic monk-a Monako in Italian, although this is a coincidence because the area is known by this name.",

By the end of the 12th century, samurai had become almost entirely identical to Bushi, and the word was closely linked to middle and upper class knights. Samurai followed a set of rules that came to be known as bushido. Although samurai are still less than 10% of the Japanese population, their teachings can still be found to this day both in everyday life and in modern Japanese martial arts. A more appropriate term is bushy, which was used in Edo's day. However, samurai terms are used for elite soldiers of the noble class, and not for example, ashigaru or foot soldiers.

The samurai's words date back to the time of Heian in Japan, where if someone is referred to as a travesty, it means that he is a messenger or a follower. Only in the beginning of modern times, especially in the era of Azuchi-Momoyama and the beginning of the Edo period at the end of the 16th century and the beginning of the 17th century, were the words of the saburai replaced by samurai. However, in those days, it meant that it had changed a long time ago.

The Japanese archer (kyujutsu) is still closely related to Hachiman's war god. Here are some other samurai terms. Samurai use some kind of weapon, but the katana (frequently referred to as samurai sword) is a weapon that is identical to their existence, In Bushido taught that the katana is a spirit of samurai and is sometimes described as a samurai very dependent on the sword in battle.

Compared with steam distillation, the DI process is faster and produces a direct rendement of oil that contains an oxygenated fraction. The amount of LOC and HOC in oil is greater than the extract of chloroform. The DI process is very efficient for isolation and can be used as pre-treatment for the development of non-voletile extraction compounds. The topical article of this plant is a moan.",

Nebulas are made of different kinds (and different kinds). Most nebulas form in the form of emission nebulas. The emissions Nebula contains ionized gases called the H II area. This type of Nebula is formed when the newly formed star ionizes the gas around it, creating an emission nebula. An example from the H II area is Orion's Nebula and NGC 604. There's also a nebula formed from Supernova explosions and Nova. The Nebula formed from a supernova called supernova remnants. An example of supernova remains is the Crab Nebula. And the nebula that was formed from the nova results is called the remnants of the nova. An example of the remains of the nova is GK Persei (or is commonly known as Nova Persei 1901). The Nebula is often also formed from stars like the Sun when it comes to its death, which is the white Katai stage. This Nebula is commonly called the planetary Nebula. This Nebula is formed when a star like the Sun runs out of fuel is. That causes the star to continue to expand until it finally blows its star wind on a large scale and causes it to lose its mass. The star wind then forms the Planeter Nebula and the star becomes the White Katai.

This is a subsistent farming technique that usually uses a little technology or other tools. It's usually part of a moving farm. Flying and burning techniques are used by some 200 to 500 million people worldwide. In 2004 it was estimated that, in Brazil alone, 500,000 small farmers each wiped out an average of one hectare of forest per year. The technique is not sustainable if it exceeds the density of certain populations because, without trees, the quality of the soil decreases to the point of being unable to support plants. Farmers had to move to the primary forest and repeat the process. Such methods as the planting system of passage between rows of Inga trees have been proposed as an alternative to this ecological collapse. Practiced fell and burned in Eno, Finland, 1893.

By the time of the Neolithic Revolution, hunters and collectors began to domesticate different kinds of plants and animals so that they could produce more food per hectare of the region than with hunting, and they began to settle down. This activity began in river civilizations in Egypt and Mesopotamia. Because not all riverside areas are open land but forests, they begin to clean it by cutting down and burning it. Fire was used by humans before neolithic times. Many experts have argued about the farming system, although the U.S. anthropologist Harold Conklin stated that farming is not much discussed in literature because the description of farming is generally omitted in negative terms.",

People who specialize in hydrology are called hydrologists, working in the fields of earth science and environmental science, as well as civil engineering and environmental engineering. Theology of the Earth's Astronomy of Earth's Health Sciences includes hydromeorology, potamology, lymphology (a relatively quiet surface water like lakes; geohidrology (land water), and water criology that is solid as ice and snow) and water quality. Hydrology also has a further use for environmental engineering, environmental policy, and planning. Hydrology also studies the behavior of rain mainly encompasses the repetitive periods of rainfall because it involves the calculation of floods as well as the plans for each civil engineering building include dams, dams and bridges. Groundwater is earth's subsurface water that is normally pumped for use as drinking water. Groundwater hydrology (hydrogeology) takes into account the measurements of groundwater flow and the transport of solutes. The problem in describing the saturated zone includes aquifer characterization in terms of flow direction, groundwater pressure, and based on alleged depth of groundwater. The measurements here can be done using piezometers. Aquifers are also explained in terms of hydraulic conductivity, storage and transmissivity. There are a number of geophysical methods to characterize aquifers. In addition, there is also a problem in characterizing the saturated zone (vadose zone). Infiltration is the process of water entry into the ground. Some of the water is absorbed, while the rest of it is collating toward the face of groundwater. The maximum rate of water absorption by the soil, called infliltration capacity, is influenced by several factors.",

Compassion lowers the axis and reduces the size of the soil pores that also result in the slower infiltration. The dry soil accelerates infliction thanks to capillaries. It's getting weaker as the soil gets wet. High temperatures lower congestion so it speeds up inflition. The moisture of the soil can be measured in the way of a capacitance probe, a time - related reflexometer or an extensionometer. There are also other methods that can be used for extracting samples of the solute and geophysical methods. The water quality study in hydrology is related to organic and inorganic compounds, including both the solute and the sediment. In addition, water quality is also affected by soluted oxygen interactions with inorganic materials and possible chemical transformations. Water quality measurement can use the in-situ method, which is done with analysis in place, often also automatically. It can also be done with laboratory-based analysis that can include water bacterological analysis. In studying hydrology processes, remote sensing can be used to gather information on remote locations. Remote sensing can also be used to measure some variables that affect the balance of water on the Earth's surface, such as earthwater storage, soil moisture, precipitation, evapotranspiration, and rain. The instruments used for remote sensing include land, air, and satellite-based sensors. Precipitation is every product of the condensation of water vapor in the atmosphere. Precipitation can be measured in various ways. To measure precipitation properties at a time interval, a device can be used for dysdrometers.

Most of those who believed Muhammad's teachings in the early days were members of his family and of the common people who were close to him, including Khadija, Ali, Zaid bin Haritsah and Bilal. But at the beginning of 613, Muhammad publicly announced Islam. After a long time there were Arabs like Abu Bakr, Utsman bin Affan, Zubair bin Al Awwam, Abdul Rahman bin Auf, Ubaidah bin Harits, Amr bin Nufail. All those first Islamic huggers were called As-Sabiqun al-Awwalanda or the first one. About 613 C.E., three years after Islam was spread secretly, Muhammad began to spread Islam openly to the people of Mecca, the response he received was very loud and massive. This is because the Islamic teachings that were brought by him were contrary to what had become Mecca's culture and mindset at the time. The leader of Mecca Abu Jahl claims that Muhammad is a madman who will ruin the life order of Mecca. Because of the severe rejection that came from the Jahiliyad society in Mecca and the power possessed by the Quraysh leaders against it, Muhammad and many early Muslims were tortured, persecuted, humiliated, banished, and ostracized from Mecca's society. Despite such treatment, he still received large numbers of followers.",

After about two months of war and a series of treaties, the muslims moved from Mecca to Yastrib, after the arrival of a group of Makka in 622 known as Medina or Madinatun the Prophet. In Medina, the reign of Islam was realized under Muhammad. Muslims are free to worship and community in Medina, as are Christian and Jewish minorities.

Radionuclides can emit radiation like alpha particles, beta particles, or gamma rays. Radionuclides can be formed either naturally or deliberately by humans using nuclear reactors, particle accelerators, or radionuclide generators. The natural radionuklida is divided into three categories, which are the primordial radionuklida, and the cosmogenic radionuklida. In addition to being naturally formed, radionuclides can also form synthetically or artificially using nuclear reactors, particle accelerators, or radionuclide generators. For example, it's technetium-95 and promethium-146. Many of these were found in the assembly of secondhand fuels (nuclear). In the formation of radionuclides, nuclear reactors are best suited for the production of neutron-rich radioisotopes, such as molibdenum-99. Whereas cyclotrons are best suited to produce proton-rich radioisotopes, for example fluor-18. Some of the applications of radionuclides in various areas are : Industrial fields use radionuclides in various ways to increase productivity and in some cases, are used to obtain information that cannot be obtained in other ways. One example of its application is industrial tracers. Radioisotops are used by manufacturers as trackers to monitor fluid flow and filtration, measure engine wear or equipment corrosion, as well as to detect water pipes blocked or leak on oil pipes. Radiotracers are also used in oil and gas industries to help determine the size of oil fields.

Radionuklida is used to provide the space shuttle's power or resources, mainly through radioisotopic thermoelectric generators (RTG) and radioisotop heating units (RHU). Radioisotopic Thermoelectric Generators (RTG) use heat produced by radioactive decay to generate electricity and often use isotopic plutonium as a source of heat.

The difference between soil and climate creates a wide variety of saps, many and even more than in the same species. The Boswellia sacra tree is considered ordinary because its ability to grow in a very impossible environment even though it sometimes grows from solid rock. The early growth of the incense on the rock was unknown, but it was likely done with the swelling of the roots and stand out from the trunks of the tree. This growth prevents him from being torn from the rock during storm season. The speciality of this tree is that very little or nothing can be planted on rocky or pebble soil.

Depending on certain contexts, the term \"natural\" can also be distinguished from unnatural, supernatural, or synthetic. Earth is the only known planet today that can support life, and its natural features are the subjects of many fields of scientific research. In the solar system, the planet is the third nearest planet of the Sun, the largest terrestrial planet and the fifth largest planet in its entirety. The most prominent climatic features are two large polar regions, two narrow temperated zones, and the tropical equator to a wide sub-tropical area. Rainfalls vary greatly from a few feet of water per year to less than a millimeter. 71% of the earth's surface is covered by saltwater oceans. The rest consists of continents and islands, with most of the inhabited land in the northern hemisphere. The Earth has evolved through geological and biological processes by leaving traces of its original condition. The outer surface is divided into several migrating plate tectonics. The interior remains active, with a thick layer of plastic coats and full iron cores that produce magnetic fields. Life has changed the atmosphere of the Earth, which creates an ecological balance that stabilizes surface conditions. Despite regional climate variations due to latitude and other geographical factors, the average long-term global climate is stable enough during interglacial periods, and a variation of one or two degrees of the historically average global temperature has a huge effect on the ecological balance, and on the actual conditions of the Earth's geography.",

It's a major science discipline, and it's also important to mine minerals and hydrocarbons, the knowledge of and the mitigation of natural disasters, some geotech engineering, and understanding of past climates and environments. Geology of an area evolved over time as the rock units stored and sank, and the deformation process changed their shape and location. Rock units are placed either by depositions to the surface or infiltrating (intrusion) to the rock above. Deposition can occur when sediment settles to the earth's surface and then it is litified into sedimentary rock, or when volcanic material is like volcanic ash and lava flows envelop the surface. Intrusion of frozen rocks like batolith and lacolytes push stones over them, and crystallize when they intrust themselves. Once the initial sequence of rocks has been stored, the rock units can deformation and/or metamorphosis. Deformation usually occurs as a result of horizontal decibels, horizontal extensions, or side movement to side (strike-slips). This structural way in general relates to converging boundaries, divergen boundaries, and change boundaries, each one, between plate tectonics. Earth was estimated to have formed 4,54 billion years ago from the solar nebula, along with the Sun and other planets. The moon formed about 20 million years later.

About 750 million years ago, the earliest known supercontinent of Rodinia began to break apart. The continents then regrouped to form a broken Pannotia some 540 million years ago, and then finally Pangaea broke off some 180 million years ago. There is significant evidence that glacial activity during the Neoproterozoic era caused most of the planets to be covered with ice. This hypothesis is referred to as \"The Snowball Earth\" and is interesting because it precedes the Cambrian eruption, which was an event when multicellular life form began to reproduce some 530-540 million years ago. Since the Cambrian explosion, there have been at least five mass extinctions. The last mass extinction occurred about 65 million years ago, when a meteorite collision probably triggered the extinction of non-gast dinosaurs and other great reptiles, but it did not eliminate small animals like mammals, which then resembled a flatline. For the past 65 million years, mammal life has been diversified. A few million years ago, a small African ape species managed to acquire the ability to stand up. Then came human life and the development of agriculture and civilizations further allowing humans to influence the Earth faster than ever before.

The current extinction event is being investigated, debated and accounted for by biologists. Earth's atmosphere plays an important role in maintaining planetary ecosystems. The thin layer of gas that envelops the Earth is held back by planetary gravity. Dried air consists of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, 1% argon and other lembam gases, carbon dioxide etc, but air also contains a number of variable water vapors. Atmospheric pressure continues to decline as it rises, and it has a scale height of about eight kilometers on the Earth's surface: altitudes where atmospheric pressure has dropped by an e factor (the same mathematical constant as 2.71...). The ozone layer of the earth's atmosphere plays an important role in filtering the amount of ultraviolet (UV) of radiation that reaches the surface. Because DNA is easily damaged by UV light, the ozone layer serves to protect life on the surface. The atmosphere also maintains heat during the night, thus reducing daily temperature extremes. The territorial weather occurs almost exclusively at the bottom of the atmosphere, and it acts as a connective system to distribute heat. Ocean currents are another important factor in determining climate, especially underwater thermohaline circulation that distributes heat energy from the equatorial ocean to the polar regions. This current helps to modernize the difference in temperature between winter and summer in temperate zones. Also, without heat energy redistribution by ocean and atmosphere currents, tropical areas would be much hotter, and polar regions would be much cooler.",

The planet's climate is the parameters of long - term trends in the weather. Various factors are known to affect the climate, including ocean currents, surface alberdos, greenhouse gases, variations in sunlight, and the change in planetary orbits. According to historical records, the Earth has been known to have experienced drastic climate change in the past, including the ice age. Some factors (especially latitude) affect the climate of an area. Latitudes with the same climate attribute form climate areas. There are a number of such areas, ranging from the tropical climate in the equiator to the polar climate at the north and south end. Weather is also influenced by seasons, resulting from earth's relatively tilted axis of orbit. Thus, at a specific time during summer or winter, one part of the planet is more direct to sunlight. The exposure to this sun occurs in shifts during the Earth rotates in its orbit. At a certain time, regardless of the seasons, the northern and southern hemispheres experience the opposite season. Weather is a chaotic system that can be modified by small changes to the environment, so accurate weather forecasts are currently limited for a few days.

Two important examples of the Aral Sea salt lake and the Great Salt Lake.

Natural lakes on Earth are generally found in mountainous areas, cracked zones, and areas with ongoing or new glaciers. Other lakes were found in the endorheik basin or along older river lines. In some parts of the world, there are many lakes because of the disorder patterns during the last Ice Age.

Waters in rivers are generally collected from rainfall through surface spleen, replenishing ground water, springs, and releases of deposits stored in natural ice and snowpacks (that is, from glaciers). In the United States, water flow is classified as a small river less than 60 feet [18 m] wide. Water flow is important as channels in the water cycle, instruments to replenish ground water, and pathways to fish and wildlife migration.

The variations of these factors will start a dynamic change in ecosystems. Some of the more important components are: soil, atmosphere, solar radiation, water, and living organisms. The main idea in the concept of ecosystems is that living organisms interact with every other element in their local environment. Eugene Odum, inventor of the ecological concept, states: \"Every unit that covers all organisms (that is: \"comunity\") in certain areas interacting with the physical environment so that the flow of energy leads to a trophy structure, a biotic diversity, and a material cycle (that is: the exchange of materials between living and not living) which are clearly in the system is an ecosystem.\" In ecosystems, species are connected and depend on each other in the food chain and the energy exchange between them and their environment. The concept of human ecosystems is based on deconstruction of human dichotomy and premises that all species are ecologically integrated to each other, as well as with the abiotic constituents of their biotopics. A smaller unit of ecosystems is called micro-ecosystems. For example, micro-ecosystems can be rocks and all life under them. A macro-ecosystem can involve an entire tailegion with its stream area.

The wild can also protect the genetic properties they provide for wild flora and fauna that may be difficult to create in zoos, arboretums or labs. Although there is no agreement for the definition of life, scientists generally accept that the characteristics of life are organizations, metabolism, growth, adaptation, response to stimuli and reproduction. Life can also be said to be a mere characteristic of organisms. The common nature for terrestrial organisms (growth, animals, mushrooms, protistas, archea and bacteria) is that they are made up of cells, carbon-based and water with complex organizations, have metabolism, the capacity to grow, respond to stimuli, and reproduce. An entity with this quality is generally considered alive. Yet, not all definitions of life view all these qualities as important. Analogs of man - made life can also be considered to have life. The biosphere is the outermost part of the Earth - including soil, surface rocks, water, air and atmosphere - in which life exists.

The life form has a basic properties of self replication and inherited properties. After life arose, the process of evolution by natural selection resulted in the development of more diverse forms of life. A species that cannot adapt to environmental changes and competition with other organisms is extinct. The fossil record, however, holds evidence of many older species. Recent fossils and DNA evidence indicate that all existing species can be traced back to the first primitive life form. The emergence of photosynthesis in a very basic form for plant life around the world allows the sun's energy to be harvested to create conditions that are possible for life to become more complex.

In addition to certain fundamental characteristics agreed upon many philosophers to explain what is seen as beauty, opinions that appear infinite. Nature and wildness have been an important subject in various eras of world history. An early tradition of landscape art began in China during the Tang Dynasty (618-907). Tradition represents nature as it is to be one of the objectives of Chinese paintings and a significant influence in Asian art. Although natural wonders have been celebrated in the Books of Psalms and Jobs, the image of the wild in art was common in the 1800s, especially in the works of romanticism. British artists John Constable and J. M. W. Turner focused their attention on describing natural beauty. Earlier, paintings were usually religious or humanist. The poem William Wordsworth describes the wonders of nature, previously viewed as a threatening place. In turn, the appreciation of nature became an important aspect of Western culture. Some fields of science view nature as a moving object, which also follows certain rules. These rules are then being understood by scientists. So the most basic science is referred to as \"physics\" which has been used up until recently to call the study of nature. Matter is generally defined as substance made up of physical objects. These matter form the universe.",

The rest, 23 percent, believed by physicists, are cold dark matter and 73 percent more are dark energy. How nature's true state remains unclear and is currently the primary investigation of physics scientists. The characteristics of matter and the energy of the universe that humans already know look like they follow the laws of physics. These laws have been used to produce physics cosmological models that can explain precisely the structure and evolution of the universe that we observe. The mathematical formulas of the laws of physics produce a set made up of 20 constants of physics that are to date seen fixed value for the known universe. The value of this constant has been carefully measured, but why its value should be so specific to this day remains a mystery. Space is a relatively empty region outside the atmosphere of a celestial object. There is no clear boundary between the Earth's atmosphere and outer space because the atmosphere is made up of a layer that is becoming thinder and higher and higher. Space on the Solar System is called interplanetary space. The boundary between interplanetary space and interstellar medium is called heliopause. Space is space, but it's not empty. Space is filled with some organic molecules that are tracked by microwave spectroscopies, the radiation left over from massive explosions, and cosmic rays. There are also some small gases, plasma, dust, and meteors. More than that, there is space debris produced by humans, which can harm space flight.

Following Rosalind Franklin's confirmation of the structure of DNA helix, James D. Watson and Francis Crick published the DNA structure in 1953 and Fred Sanger's publication on the Amino acid sequence in 1955, the sequence of nucleic acids became the primary target of early molecular biologists. In 1964, Robert W. Holley and his associates published the first ever determined sequence of nucleic acids, the ribonukleotide sequence of the RNA transferalin.

This involves two closely related methods that produce a short oligonukleotide with a predetermined termini 3'. It can be fluctuated with electroforesis on polyakrilamide gel (called polyakrilamide electroforesis) and visualized using auto radiography. This procedure can sequence up to 80 nucleotides in one street and is a major improvement, but it's still very tiring.

The classic philosophical question includes: Is it possible to know everything and prove it? What's most real? Philosophers also asked such practical and concrete questions as: Is there a better way to live? Is it better to be fair or unfair (if one gets away with it)? Do humans have free will? Historically, philosophy covers the essence of all knowledge. From the days of ancient Greek philosophers like Aristotle to the 19th century, the philosophy of nature encompassed astronomy, medicine, and physics. For example, Newton's Mathematical Philosophy in 1687 was later classified as a physics book. In the 19th century, the development of modern university research led to academic philosophy and other disciplines professionalized and specialized. In modern times, some investigations that are traditionally part of philosophy have become separate academic disciplines, some of which are psychology, sociology, linguistics, and economics. Other investigations closely associated with art, science, politics, and some other areas remain part of philosophy. For example, is beauty objective or subjective? Is there a lot of scientific methods or is there just one? Is political utopia a hopeful dream or just a vain delusion?

In a general sense, philosophy is associated with wisdom, intellectual culture, and search for knowledge. In this case, all cultures and peoples are literate asking philosophical questions like \"how we live\" and \"what is the nature of reality.\" Vast and impartial philosophical conceptions then found a rational investigation into such issues as reality, morality and life in all civilizations of the world.

Western philosophy can be divided into three eras: Ancient (Greek - Roman), medieval philosophy (Christian Europe), and modern philosophy. The ancient era was dominated by the teaching of Greek philosophy that emerged from some of Socrates' disciples, such as Plato who founded the Platonic Academy.

Problems such as the existence and nature of God, the nature of faith and reason, the metaphysics, the problem of crime is discussed in this period. Some of the Middle Ages' main thinkers included St. Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, Boethius, Anselm and Roger Bacon. The philosophy of these thinkers was viewed as a support for theology (ancilla theologies) and therefore they sought to conform their philosophy to their interpretation of Scripture. This period triggered the development of scolasticism, a method of critical text developed in medieval universities based on reading and debates that are close to key texts. The Renaissance period (1355-1650) more saw an increase in focus on classical Greek-Romawi thinking and the powerful influence of humanism. The early modern philosophy of the Western world began with thinkers like Thomas Hobbes and Ren\u00e9 Descartes (1596-1650).

Metaphysics is discussing the subject of identity. Essence is an attribute set of attributes that make objects as basic and without the essence of the object will lose its identity, while the stunt is an object's property, without which the object can still maintain its identity. Particular is an object that is said to exist in space and time, opposite to abstract objects, such as numbers and universals, which are attributes that some special things have, such as the red color of an object or sex.

Politics and ethics are two subjects that are traditionally related, because they discuss questions about how people should live together. Other branches of value theory include: a lot of discipline leads to philosophical questions. The connection between \"X\" and \"philosophy X\" is still debated. Richard Feynman argued that the philosophy of a topic is irrelevant to his main research, he said that \"scientific philosophy is as useful to scientists as ornithology is to birds.\" Curtis White, on the other hand, argues that philosophical tools are essential to humaniora, science and social science. The topic of philosophy of science is numbers, symbols and formal methods of reasoning as used in social and natural science. Logic is the study of reason and argument. Argument is \"a series of statements connected and intended to build a proposition.\" A series of connected statements is called \"premis\" and proposition is the conclusion. To illustrate: Hence, Socrates was mortal. The deductive exercise is when given certain premises, the conclusion is implied and inevitable. Inference rules are used to conclude such conclusions as, the mode of ponsens, where given to \"A\" and \"If A then B\", then \"B\" should be summarized. Because good reasoning is an important element of all science, social science and humaniora discipline, logic becomes a formal science. Sub-field logic, among other things, mathematical logic, philosophical logic, logic capital, computing logic and non-classical logic.",

In mathematics, simple lines can be imagined as a list of objects (like numbers, functions, random modifiers, etc) arranged in a specific order. Every object in the line is numbered in order or indexed to show where it is in that row. The object with the index i is called theti tribe. Many tribes are in lines (perhaps infinity) called long lines. Unlike the assembly, the order of tribes in line is vital. Like lines of letters (S, E, U, L G, I) are different from lines of letters (G, E.U., L, I, S) although the set of values is equal to {E, G, I, L, S, U}. The exact same element can appear repeatedly at different places in a row. Like in the Fibonacci line, the number 1 appears in the first and second tribes. More precisely, a line can be viewed as a function with its original area of origin is the original number. Most of the tribes are lined up by certain patterns, which can be formulated like arithmetic lines and geometry lines, or which are shaped by certain rules like Fibonacci lines and prime numbers. But in general the line doesn't have to follow a certain pattern. The lines can simply be imagined as a list of things that line up. Each member of a row is called a tribe and each common tribe is written in symbol of un{\\displaystyle u_{n}, as symbolizing the n tribe. More precisely, the row is a rule linking the original number to members of a set, which is 1{\\displaystyle 1} associated with u1{\\displaystyle u_{1}}, 2{\\displaystyle 2} associated with u2displaystyle u_{2}, and so on. The line itself is usually written in symbol (un)",

For example, the arithmetic row with its original tribe was 3, the difference between 7, and many of its tribes were five, can be written as (3,10,17,24,31) If it's up to that number, but it's quite a lot of people, it can be done by writing down some of its initial tribes, a three-point mark, and some of its last tribes, like (u1,u2,u3,...,un) If the line is endless, it's usually written some tribes that follow a three-point mark, such as row (2,4,6,8,...) which is an even number line. The weakness of this way is a pattern that should be intended by the reader. The most common guess for rows (1,2,3...) is the original number line (1,2,3,5,5,6.7...) The line may be lined up (1,2,3,1,1),17,124,53,...) Another example is that, for example, some early groups are known (3,1,4,1,5,...) But it may also be a true line of digits, which is a row of pi digits, which is (3,1,4,1,5,9,2,6,5,...) Between the solutions to the pattern line is to determine the line with the common tribal formula of the line. Like row (1n2), which states the original square reverse line. Or row of signs that can be formulated as (1) Some lines can also be defined recursively. That was the ordinance of the former tribes. Some of the examples of the regular lines expressed by repeat relation are the Fibonacci an=an=1+an1=2, fontcolor=\" # FFFF00\"displaystyle a_{n}=a_{n-}+a_{n-2},} under the initial condition of a0=0=0\\displaystyle a_{0}={0}={0} and a1=1.

In fact, the term \u0567Geometry for the matter is enough to mention the science of earth measurements, where geometry comes from Greek, Literally means measuring about the earth. But geometry terms (especially spatial science or space) which are the basis for learning geodesy have been commonly referred to as a branch of mathematics. According to Helmert and Torge (1880), geodesy is the science of earth's measurements and mapping of the surface that also includes the sea floor. According to the IAG (International Association of Geodesy, 1979), geodesy is the discipline of science that studies the measurements and representations of Earth and other celestial bodies, including its weight force fields, in a three-dimensional space that changes with time. In the U.S. National Research Council report, geodesy definitions can be read as follows: a branch of applied maths that determines by observations and measures the exact position of points and the figures and areas of large documents of the earth's surface, the shape and size of the earth, and the variations of gravity. In different languages, geodesy is a branch of applied mathematics, which is done by taking measurements and observations to determine: The definition has two aspects: Now geodesy techniques are no longer just related to surveys and mappings.

After the redefinition in 2019, the definition of a kilogram, such as the one mentioned in the ninth edition of the IC brochure, was the following. Kilograms, symbolized by kilograms, are mass units in IC. This unit is defined by getting fixed numeric values from Planck h constants of 6,626015\u00d710101034 if expressed in a unit comparable to the 6-foot-two-meters, with the defined definition of meters and seconds associated with c and \u25ef\u03bdCs. Previously, kilograms were defined equal to the mass of a standard kilogram called the International Kilogram Purwa (British: International Prototype of the Kilogram, IPK), stored in Sevres, France. The mass of this standard kilogram is nearly the same as the mass of one quart [1 L] of water. After the redefinition, the mass measurement instruments that are more precision can be made and calibrated by the metrology lab. Kibble scales as a major instrument that calculates the mass of the right kilograms today. The Kilogram is the only starting unit used as a basic unit, instead of a gram which is the basic form of a kilogram unit. One gram is defined as 1/1000 kilograms. In everyday use, the mass of an object is likened to weight, when in fact both are completely different things, judging by its values and concepts. In the context of science, mass refers to the number of particles in an object, while weight refers to the force experienced by an object because of the force of gravity; an object with a mass of one kilogram will weigh between 9.78 newton and 9.83 newton, depending on the gravity in that place.

This name is derived from the encouragement to go back to understanding the ancestors (salaf), the first three generations of Muslims who knew the pure Islamic teachings without additives and reductions. These are the Prophets of Allah, and those who have been taught the Book (the Quran), and the Prophet (Muhammad SAW), and the Prophet (Muhammad SAW), and those who are Al-Muttaqun (the pious - see V. 2:2). practically, Salafi argued that Muslims should rely on the Qur'an, Sunnah and Ijma', giving them priority over later interpretation of religion. This movement aims to renew Muslim life and it has exerted great influence on many Muslim thinkers and movements throughout the Islamic World. From the beginning, Salafism had developed by means of efforts by various Islamic reformers, whose activities spread throughout the region. The term Salafi was made by Ibn Taimiyah in the 8th century Hijriyah, and Muhammad bin Wahhab revived this term in the Najd region in the 12th century H, which made Salafi a reform movement founded by one of the most prominent representatives of the modern era. The doctrine of Salafi is based on looking back into the early years of Islam to understand how contemporary Muslims should practice their faith. Salafi rejects religious or heretic innovation and supports the application of the sharia. In his political approach, movements are sometimes divided by academics and Western journalists into three categories: the largest groups are puritans (or quiet), who avoid politics; the second largest groups are activists, who maintain regular involvement in politics; and the third group are jihadists, who form minorities and encourage armed struggles to restore early Islam.",

In contemporary times, Salafism referred to a group of different Sunni reforms and has remained a significant trend in Islamic thinking for over a century. The contemporary Salafiyah was formed as a revivative movement throughout the Muslim World during the late 19th century in the context of European Imperialism. The word salafiyah is abbreviated to the word \"salaf al \u0101li.\" In Islamic terminology in general, it is used to point to the three best generations of Muslims that are friends, tabi'in, tabi'ut tabi'in. These three generations are considered to be the best examples of the Islamic hierarchy. The salafi word is often associated with Wahendem (to most of its followers, the Wahabi is considered insulting; they prefer Salafism), so these two terms are often viewed as synonyms. Usually, a Salafy believer describes himself as \"Muwahidin,\" \"Ahl Hadits,\" or \"Ahl at-Tauhid.\" The point of the basic ideologies of the salafi is that Islam was completed in the days of Muhammad and his companions, therefore there was neither innovation nor addition nor reduction in the way of Islam.

The Salafi look to Ibn Taimiyah, not to the 19th-century figure Muhammad Abduh, Jamal al-Din, Rashid Ride.

A return preferred to the pure path of the Prophet is called \"It arrived\" (following the Prophet directly referenced to the Holy Scriptures). In the legal approach, Salafi was divided among those who, in the name of independent judgment (ijtihad), rejected strict obedience (taqlid) to four madzhab (madhahib) and others who remained faithful to this. Although Muhammad bin Wahhab personally refused Taqlid's practice, the Wahhabi scholars preferred to follow the madzhab of the Hali and generally allowed Taqlid to follow Fatwa (lawful law) and to push to Al-zhab. While they doctrinally condemned Taqlid and encouraged Ijtihad, the historical practice of Wahhabi law was largely based on the boundaries of Hanbali School, to date.

Some Western observers and analysts tend to liken this movement to Salafi Jihadism, a hybrid ideology that supports violent attacks on those considered enemies of Islam (including Salafi) as legitimate Islamic expressions. German government officials have accused Salafism of having a strong relationship with terrorism but have then clarified that not all Salafi are terrorists. German government officials who criticized Salafism were broadcast by Deutsche Welle during April 2012. According to German political scientist Thorsten Gerald Schneiders, although Salafi claims to rebuild Islamic values and defend Islamic culture, some members of the movement interpret it in a manner that does not conform to Islamic tradition and consider certain elements of Muslim culture such as poetry, literature, song, philosophy, etc as the work of the devil.

Although misinterpreted as a lead compound with components of selenium and iron, these minerals are actually chromates with the PbCrO formula. In 1770, Peter Simon Pallas visited the same site that Lehmann visited and found red - lead minerals that had the benefits of pigmenting in paint. Siberia's red - lead use as paint pigments then grew rapidly. Bright yellow pigmen made from krecoit also became popular. In 1797, Louis Nicolas Vauquelin received a crokoit ore sample. It makes chromium trioxide (CrO) by mixing the chromoite with chloride acid. In 1798, Vauquelin discovered that it could isolate chromium metal by heating its oxide in a coal oven, so it was awarded as an inventor of chromium. Vauquelin is also able to detect traces of chromium in precious gemstones, such as rubies or emeralds. During the 1880s, chromium was used mainly as a paint component and in leather - feeding salt. At first, the krecoit of Russia was a major source, but in 1827 a larger chromit deposit was found near Baltimore, in the United States. This makes the United States the largest producer of chromium products to 1848 when large deposits of chromite are found near Exchange, Turkey. Chromium is also known for its sparkle when polished.

Papp, who wrote for USGS: Ferromium is the end end of the chromite ore use, and] nircarat steel is the end end of the ferochromium use. The largest producer of chromium ore in 201 was South Africa (48%), Kazakhstan (13%), Turkey (11%), India (10%) with some other countries producing about 18% of the world's production. Two major products of chromium ore processing are ferochromium and chromium metal. For those products, the process of melting ore is very different. For the production of ferochromium, cromite ore (FeCr) is reduced on a large scale in an electric bow or a smaller sprinkler in both aluminum and silicon in an aluminothermic reaction. For pure chromium production, iron must be separated from chromium in two stages of roasting and rolling. Chromic ore is heated by a mixture of calcium carbonate and sodium carbonate with the presence of air. Chromium dioxide into its hexadean form, while iron forms a stable Fe. The next slide at higher temperatures dissolves the chromates and leaves an unintended iron oxide. Chromats are converted into diromats using sulfuric acid.

To prevent change in energy consumption in oxidation state, sulfate chromium usage is being developed, but for most applications, it is used by established processes.

The most common hydrogen isotope in nature is protium, whose nucleus has only a single proton and no neutron. The hydrogen ionic compound can either be charged positive (kation) or negative (anion). Hydrogen can form compounds with most elements and can be found in water and organic compounds. Hydrogen is very important in a base acid reaction where many of these reactions involve an exchange of protons between soluted molecules. Because hydrogen is the only neutral atom whose Schr\u00f6dinger equations can be solved analytically, studies on energy and hydrogen atomic bonds play a very important role in quantum mechanics development. The solvent and characteristics of hydrogen with a variety of metals are a very important subject in the field of metallurgy (because hydrogen intake can occur in most metals) and in research development a safe way to store hydrogen as fuel.",

The explosion of the Hindenburg aircraft is one of the most famous examples of hydrogen burning. Another characteristic of hydrogen fire is that flames tend to disappear rapidly in the air, resulting in the damage caused by hydrogen explosions lighter than hydrocarbon explosions. In the case of Hindenburg's accident, two thirds of passengers survived and most cases died of leaking diesel fuel. H2 relatively not reactive.

The levels of hydrogen power can be calculated quite accurately using the Bohr atomic model that describes electrons circulated around protons with the Earth's analogy circulated around the Sun. Because of the momentum discretization angles that Bohr postulated at the beginning of quantum mechanics, the electrons in the Bohr model can only occupy certain distances from protons and therefore only some of the specific energy allowed. The more accurate description of hydrogen atoms is obtained by the treatment of pure quantum mechanics using Schr\u00f6dinger equations or by the integral proportion of the Feyman trajectories to calculate the congestion of electrons around protons. The most complicated treatment allows for a small effect of special relativity and polarization of vacuums. In quantum mechanics treatment, electrons in hydrogen atoms in a basic state have no momentum angle at all, which describes how the \"orbit planet\" differs from the electron movement. There are two different types of hydrogen diatomic molecules based on the relative spin of the nucleus. In the form of ortohidrogen, the spin of two protons is parallel and in triplet state; in parahydrogen, the spin is antiparallel and is singlet.

The uncatalyzed interface between H2 and orto is increasing as temperatures rise; therefore H2 is stored rapidly containing a lot of hydrogen in the form of ortos that are going to turn into the form of people very slowly. Nisbah orto/para on H2 is a factor that needs to be accounted for in preparation and storage of liquid hydrogen: between the change of form ortos to those is exothermic and can produce enough material to vaporize the liquid hydrogen and cause the reduction of liquid components. Catalyst for interchange orto-para, such as iron compounds, is often used during hydrogen cooling. A form of a molecule called protonated hydrogen molecule, or H, is found in an interstellar medium (ISM), where it is generated with ionization of the hydrogen molecules of the cosmos rays.

More detail studies show other alternate trajectorys and are not atoms of H. hydrogen atoms can be produced at high enough temperatures (>2000 K) so that H2 molecules can be dissociated. In addition, electromagnetic radiation above 11 eVs can also be absorbed in H2 and cause dissociation.

Another view says that the chemically absorbed hydrogen is \"unreactive\" from hydrogen nasen caused by the bonds produced by the metal's catalyst surface.

Millions of types of hydrocarbons are known, but they are not directly produced from hydrogen and carbon. Hydrogen can form compounds with more electronegative elements such as halegen (F, Cl, Br, I); in this compound hydrogen has a partial positive charge. When bonding with fluor, oxygen or nitrogen, hydrogen can participate in a strong form of non-kovalent bonds, called hydrogen bonds that are vital to the stability of most biological molecules.

According to quantum theory, these properties are caused by the distance between hydrogen's massive rotational forces because of its light mass. This wide level inhibits the elemental energy partitions evenly into the motion of hydrogen at low temperatures.

This process also produces an alumina, but the price of the gallium is expensive, with its nature that can prevent the formation of layers of oxide on the pellet surface, making it reusable. This brings crucial implications to the hydrogen economy, because hydrogen can be produced in places and does not require transportation. When determining the electrical efficiency of the PEM electrolysis (transference of proton/proton exchange membranes), the value of the carter (HHV) is used higher. This is because the catalyst layer interacts with the water as steam. Because the process operates at a temperature of 80 \u00b0 C for the PEM electrolysert, waste heat can be diverted through the PEM system to produce steam, so the electrical efficiency is higher. Lower heat values (LHV) must be used for alkaline electrolysers because the process in this electrolyser requires liquid water and uses alkalinity to facilitate the disconnecting of the bonds that bind hydrogen and oxygen atoms.

Other hydrocarbons besides methane can be used to produce synthetic gases with different product ratios. One of the complications of this sophisticated technology is the formation of cokes or carbons: As a result, steam reforming usually uses excess H.

In addition to having different names, Indonesia also has the type of diamonds. The most known Wajik is the sticky diamond of diamonds derived from glutinous rice. Although the cake is widely known in Indonesia, it is also well - known in neighboring countries, so it is sometimes recognized as a typical cake for neighboring Indonesia. Commonly known to the public are diamonds that come from sticky rice or sticky diamonds. The glutinous waik is made from steamed glutinous rice and is then cooked with a mixture of milk and sugar to oily and soft. The sugar used on this type of diamond is usually red sugar. The red sugar used will make diamonds light brown and dark. Once the diamonds are removed from the processing grounds, the diamonds will then be formed or sliced in accordance with the maker's wishes. The usual shape is the shape of a cleavage or parallelogram. Javanese splits or parallels are commonly called diamond shapes, hence the name of diamonds. Diamond cakes usually also smell good because they use pandants in the process. Other types of sticky diamonds besides brown may have other colors such as green and pink. The green of the diamond cake comes from a natural dye of suji leaves, while pink can be obtained from food dyes.",

The clitic wakik also has the same main ingredient as the sticky diamond of glutinous rice. The difference between a clitic diamond with a sticky diamond is, the clitic diamond is wrapped smallly using the bark of corn or chlorbot. The bark of corn will be ironed to break free from bacteria so that diamonds become more lasting. The name of the diamonds is derived from the origin of Bandung. Wajiks are also made of glutinous rice, but they are mixed with scar and sugar coconuts. Shakers are wrapped in little pieces using colorful oil paper. The paper made the daisy of diamonds more alive. The difference between sticky diamonds and shaded diamonds is in their texture, in the texture - density diamond its appearance is dominant to rice but to the dominant diamond of the coconut lunging. Diamond cakes have a legit taste of sweetness. The sweetness is often added to other aromas such as pandants and vanilla while the taste of this food has the original flavor of red sugar and durian flavor. Diamond cakes have an immature texture of rice, but when eaten they are soft and biteable. Diamond cakes are widely used as dishes for guests. Some areas also use diamonds as souvenirs like in Magelang and Blitar. Magelang introduced red - brown diamonds as by-by Magelang, while Blitar introduced the clitic diamonds as a typical by-by-by Blitar. Diamond cakes are also used in shitting. This cake must be on a special meal in the Yogyakarta and Central Java region.",

        "paragraph": "The polymer is a repetitive chain of long atoms, formed by an identical molecule called monomer. Although it is usually organic, there are also many inorganic polymers. The famous example of polymers is plastic and DNA. The polymer is defined as a substance made up of molecules that include a sequence of one or more units of monomer. Humans have been using polymers for centuries in the form of oils, asphalts, gums, gums. But the modern polymer industry didn't start to develop until the time of the industrial revolution. In the late 1830s, Charles Goodyear was able to produce a useful natural rubber form through a process known as \u25efvulcanization. 40 years later, celluloids were commercialized. It was the introduction of vinyl, neoprene, polystyrene, and nylon in the 1930s that started the explosion in the polymer research that is still going on today. The polymer word is a derivative of the Greek word poly and mer. Poly means \"many,\" whereas mer means  care of her. Polymer has a synonym which is a macromolecule. This synonym is associated with synthetic polymers produced from simple molecules called monomer. The use of the word polymer was first carried out in 1833 by Swedish chemist Berzelius. The 19th - century C.E. chemists worked on macromolecules without having a clear understanding of their structure. Although polymer terms are more popular in pointing to plastic, polymers are actually made up of many natural and synthetic material classes with different properties and uses. Natural polymer materials like shellac and amber have been used for centuries. Paper is produced from cellulose, a naturally occurring polycaride found in plants. Biopolimers such as protein and nucleic acid play an important role in the biological process.",

        "paragraph": "The polymers are made by binding small molecules called monomers into polymers with the polymerization process. This process formed a covalent bond between monomeres that formed a strong bond. With catalysts or certain polymer processes it can have structures that are linear, branched, short chains, as well as a combination of some of those structures. Polymer based on its source can be distinguished in three groups, which is: Termoplastic is a kind of plastic that softens when it warms up and it hardens when it cools. The decreasing process and thermoplasmic hardening can take place many times. Thermolastic rename is derived from the re-forming of plastic properties by the warming process. Termoplastics contain hydrocarbon resins and glass beads. The most common thermolastic application is for road marker generation. The thermolastic road markers have a high reflection, a strong endurance and a very long use of life. Thermoset is a polymer that cannot melt or melt as it warms up. The main nature of thermorets is that there is a bond that causes massive molecular gains. Thermoset cannot be formed and cannot be dissolved while heated. Thermostats include phenol formaldehyde, urea-formaldehyde, unsatisfied polyester, epoxy, and memin-formaldehyde. Fenol-formaldehyde is used in the manufacture of electrical and electronic equipment, car parts, plywood glue, and kitchen handles. Urea-formaledide is used as an unsatisfied polyester layering material used in building materials, car parts, hulls, ship accessories, anti corrosion channels, pipes, tanks and business equipment. Epoxy was found in protective layering materials, glues, electrical and electronic equipment, industrial floor materials, highway blockers, and composite materials. Whereas melanin-formalaldehyde is widely used in decoration frames, tablecloths, and utensils. Elastomer is a print made from polyulfid, polyester, silicon condensation and silicon adition.",

Silicon additives in elastomeres are highly suited for printing the making of concise artificial teeth because they have high accuracy. Its lack lies at high prices and its hydrophobic nature. Commercial polymers are generally produced in developing countries at low prices for daily use. The primary ingredient in commercial polymer production is polyethylene, polypropilene, polytyrene, polyvinilchloride, or memamine formaldehyde. Low mass polyethylene is used in layers of packaging, insulation of wire, layers of cable, toys, flexible bottles, and layering materials. Polietilena with high mass is used in bottlemaking, drums, pipes, channels, sheet film, insulation wire and cable. Polypropilene is used in the making of ropes, untamings, carpets, and movies. Polyvinil chloride is used as building material, tough pipes, floor material, as well as wire and cable isolation. The polystyrene, on the other hand, is used as a packaging material with layers of foam, furniture, and toys. Technical polymers are produced by both developing and developed countries. The cost of polymer engineering is quite expensive because of its sophisticated nature. Technical polymers have superior mechanical properties and strong endurance. The use of an engineering polymer in transportation of four - wheeled vehicles and airplanes. In material science, polymers are used as plumbing materials, electrical equipment for business machines, electronic equipment especially computers, as well as industrial machines and consumption goods. The type of polymer techniques include nylons, polycarbonates, polyulphones, and polyesters. A functional polymer is produced and developed in developed countries. The making of a functional polymer is intended for special use so that its production is done on a small scale.

        "paragraph": "The mechanical nature of polymers involves how physical traits occur in a polymer after a wide range of external forces. These traits are very useful to consider how polymers can be used. Some of its parameters include: The core of a powerful test relates to how external force treatment is affected by certain materials or terms often used by pressure or voltage. By the direction of its style, different forces are differed to: Maximum extensions show how much the maximum stretch that a polymer can achieve before it breaks or breaks, the percentage is measured based on the length of the material. Young modulus elasticity or modulus is the ratio of voltage to the strain that occurs in the material. The modulus of elasticity effectively provides the size of an elasticity of a material. Resilience states how much energy is needed until the material is broken or broken. Polymeres play an important role in various industries. Six major commodities of polyethylene, polyproplene, chloride polyvinyl, chloride polyethylene, polyethylene, polytylene, and polycarboat. They form 98% of all the polymers and plastics found in everyday life. Each of these polymers has the properties of degradation and heat resistance, light and chemistry. Polymer is also a material used in biosensors, biomedicals, automotives, packaging, cosmetics, and other uses. The materials used in polymers include: raw materials, polymer compounds, foam, structural glue and composites, fillings, fibers, films, membranes, emulsion, coatings, rubbers, sealers, resins, solvents, inks and pigments. Disposable diapers are made with polymers that are difficult to break down biologically. The wear of a disposable diaper is very short, but it lasts very long.

Chewing materials are distinguished into natural chewing materials and synthetic chewing agents. Certain amounts of polymer residue are used to make synthetic chewing as a basis for chewing gum. Polymer can produce natural rubbers and silicone rubbers. Natural rubber is one of nature's polymers, while silicone rubber is one of the synthetic polymers. Natural rubber rubber is produced by means of rubber plantations, while silicone rubber is produced through the petrochemical industry. siliconic rubber has been used in medical science in the manufacture of artificial rectum organs. While natural rubbers are used in experiments for the manufacture of artificial human tissues instead of medical science practices. Natural rubber characteristics and siliconic rubber are studied through radiotherapy exploration using linear accelerators. Composits are materials that form two or more components that have different properties. Computing materials can be hybrids made of polymer resin and reinforced with fibers so they combine both mechanical and physical properties. Composits can also be formed through mixing of two or more different atoms with the condition of molecules and crystal cells still single. In this condition, composites are made of mixed metal, polymers or mixed metal and polymers. Lignoselulose is a combination of three kinds of polymers with solid matrix bonds. Lignocellulose building blocks include lignin, cellulose, and hemiselulose. Lignocellulose can be used for the manufacture of bioethenol. Osmometry is one method of determining the weight of an average number of polymer molecules. The working principle used is osmosis.

        "paragraph": "The weakness of the osmometry method is not being able to measure some polymers that have low molecular weight. The polymer at low molecular weight will be diffusion through the membrane. Thus, the average amount of molecular weight measured doesn't exactly say the full price of the weight of the molecular polymer sample. An analysis of the tip group is a method of analyzing the weight weight of the average molecule of the polymer count. How to make good use of the group of functions that are at the end of the polymer. In this method, weights can be measured both chemically and physics. The kind of method of measuring is divided into titration and spectrometry. This method can only be used for linear polymers and branch polymers whose number of branches is known with certainty and has definite polymerization mechanisms as well. The method of analysis is not effectively used for polymers that have two end groups or more, or for some different tip groups in one polymer chain. Another flaw of this method is that it's only effective to measure polymers that have a molecular weight of 500010000. Ultracentric is measuring the weight of the average molecular polymer by counting the balance and the speed of the sedimentation. Sedimentation balance is done with a low-speed playback of the polymer solution at any given time. The playback is terminated when the balance is reached between the sedimentation and diffusion. Sedimentation is confirmed at the speed of a round that reaches 70,000 rpm. Sedimentary rate determines the magnitude of the measurable dydiment. The magnitude of the cedimentary rate is the sedimentary fixedness associated with the mass of particles. The science of membranes didn't have much practical application before 1950. The increased application of membrane science comes after advances in polymer chemistry. The creation of a synthesis polymer provides a new membrane with a certain nature of nature. In addition, it is produced by polymers with excellent mechanical and thermal stability.",

As for the scope of a study of Islamic criminal law, it includes the crime of qisas, hudud, and Takzir. The word abasis comes from Arabic asasun which means basic or principle, whereas the word legality comes from the Latin word lex, which means law, or from the legalist word, which means legalism. Thus legality is the legality of something under the law. As for legality in the shaari of Islam, it's not as clearly defined as it is in a positive law book. Nevertheless, it does not mean that the shaari of Islam is not aware of legality. Asas legality is popularized by the Latin expression: Nullum Deliktum Nulla Poena Sine Pravia Lege Poenali (no delik no punishment before there was first provision). This Asas is a basic guarantee of individual freedom by limiting what activities are properly and clearly forbidden. Asas this protects against the abuse of power or the authority of a judge, guaranteeing the safety of an individual with permissible and forbidden information.
