With an area of about 44 acres [44 ha], and a population of 842, the Vatican City State is the smallest independent country in the world, both its area and its population, internationally recognized. This country is either eclesiatic or monarchy-sakerdotal ruled by the Pope's bishop of Rome. The highest officials of this country are all Catholic clergy from various countries. Since the return of the Pope of Avignon in 1377, they have generally lived in the Palace of Apostolic in what is now the City of the Vatican, although sometimes they also reside in the Quirinal Palace in Rome or elsewhere. The Vatican City State term differs from the Holy Throne (Latin: Sancta Sedes)d), but sometimes it is used collectively. The Holy Throne came from early Christianity and was the principal episcopal throne of 1.2 billion Eastern and Latin Catholics around the world, where from the beginning it was at the same place as the Vatican Hill. This independent city nation, on the other hand, was formed in 1929 through the Lateran Treaty between the Holy Throne and Italy, which spoke of this establishment as a new creation, not as the remains of the Church State (756-1870) which had previously covered much larger parts of Italy. According to the treaty, the Holy Throne has \"full possession, exclusive power, and jurisdiction and sovereign authority\" over the Vatican City State.",

In 326 the first church was built on what is thought to be Saint Peter's tomb. Since then, this place has become more and more inhabited. The Popes in their secular roles began to expand their influence on the surrounding areas and through the Pope countries ruled many regions of the Italian peninsula for over a thousand years until the middle of the 18th century when all of Italy was united. At that time the territory of the Pope's country was seized by the newly established empire of Italy. Then in 1870, in the Italian union movement, church leaders were put into Italian territory and the Pope's domain was reduced even more when Rome was exported. But the Roman catholic church did not accept this and there was a conflict between the church and the Italian empire that was finally resolved with the Lateran agreement (also known as the Concordat) signed on February 11, 1929 by Cardinal Gaspari representing Pius XI and Benito Mussolini representing King Victor Emmanuel III. The main content of this treaty was the recognition of the sovereign and independent Vatican State under the rule of the Holy Throne, the special status for Italian Catholicism, and the compensation for the Vatican for the loss suffered when the Italian state was established. The Lateran agreement remained recognized, although after World War II the Italian royal system ended and turned into a republic. In 1984 the Concordat was recalibrated. The Vatican is a unique causcus, an elective monarchy where the function of the head of the state, the Pope, is not inherited but chosen by the Cardinal's Council.",

Positron has an electrical charge of +1e, a 1\u20442 spin, and it has the same mass as an electron. When low energy positrons collide with low energy electrons, annihilation occurs, which produces photons of gamma rays. Positrons are produced from positron radioactive decay emissions (through weak interaction) or through a pair of productions from energy-powered photons. In 1928, Paul Dirac published a paper suggesting that electrons could have two positive charges and negative energy. This paper contains the Dirac equation, the combination between quantum mechanics, special relativity, and then the new concept of electron spin to explain Zeeman's effects. The paper does not predict the presence of new particles, but it allows the electron to have positive or negative energy as a solution. Positive energy solutions explain the outcome of the experiment, but Dirac is confused by the valid equation of equalizing the energy-negative solutions that in mathematical models are allowed. But quantum mechanics is not allowed. The solution to negative energy is simply ignored. As classical mechanics is often done in that equation. Dmitri Skobeltsyn first observed positron in 1929.

Skobeltsyn detects the presence of particles that have electronlike properties but are curved in the opposite direction in the application of magnetic fields.

Two interconnected goals sought by many alchemists are philosophers, a mythical substance that allows common metal transmutation to become gold; and universal panacea, a drug that can cure all diseases and prolong life. The alchemy can be viewed as a classic of modern chemistry before it was formulated by scientific method.n 1) The word alchemy comes from Arabic al-kimiya or al-khimiya, meaning \"printing together,\" \"polling together,\" \"aloy,\" and so on (from hument, \"which is poured out, metal stems\"). Another etymology links this word to the word \"Al Kemi,\" which means \"Egyptian Art,\" because the ancient Egyptians called their country \"Mami\" and were viewed as a magical wizard throughout the ancient world. Most people view alchemists as pseudoscience experts who seek to turn lead into gold, believing that all matter is made up of four elements of soil, air, fire, and water, and possessing mystical and magical water. From a modern point of view, their efforts and beliefs are considered to have limited validity. But not in the context of their times. They tried to explore and investigate nature before the vast majority of basic scientific tools and practices were available, and instead depended on digitation, tradition, basic observations, and mysticism to fill these holes. To understand alchemists, try to reflect on how miraculous the transformation of a substance becomes another substance, which has been the basis for metallurgy since the beginning of this science at the end of Neolithum, for cultures that do not understand physics or chemistry formally.",

At that time, physics that had no metaphysic insight was considered incomplete as metaphysics had no physical manifestation. Thus, symbols and processes of alchemy usually have both an inner meaning that refers to the spiritual development of its practitioners, as well as the material meaning associated with the physical changes of matter. A common metal transmutation into gold symbolizes an effort toward perfection or the highest height of existence. Alchemists believe that the entire universe is moving toward perfect conditions; and gold, as never broken, is considered the most perfect substance. By trying to turn ordinary metals into gold, they're actually trying to help the universe. So, it's logical to think that by understanding the secrets of the unchanging gold, they'll find the key to preventing organic disease and decay; that's the link between chemical, spiritual, and astrological themes into medieval alchemical features. Hence, the naive interpretation of some alchemists, or false expectations promoted by others, must not reduce the value of the more sincere efforts of other practitioners. Moreover, the field of alchemy has changed a lot throughout the ages, starting as a branch of metallurgy, becoming an adult into a rich and legitimate field of study, evolved into mysticism and blunt deception, and eventually gave some basic empirical knowledge for modern chemistry and medicine. Until the 18th century, alchemy was considered a serious science in Europe; for example, Isaac Newton devoted much time to this art. Another major alchemist in the Western world is Roger Bacon, Saint Thomas Aquinas, Tycho Brahe, Thomas Browne, and Parmigianino. The decline of alchemy began in the 18th century with the birth of modern chemistry, which provided a more meticulous and reliable framework for transmutation of substances and drugs, in the new design of the universe based on rational materialism.",

This reaction depends on the type of oxidized skeleton bond and on the condition in which the reaction takes place. Ozonicis was discovered by Christian Friedrich Sch\u00f6nbein in 1840. Before the discovery of modern spectroscopy techniques, the ozonealysis was an essential method for determining the structure of organic compounds. A chemist would zone an unknown alchemy to produce fragments that were small and easy to identify. Ozonolysis alkena is sometimes referred to as \"ozonic Harries,\" because some attribute this reaction to Carl Dietrich Harries. Alkena can oxidize with ozone to produce alcohol, idehida or ketons, or carboxicic acid. In typical procedures, the ozone is bubbled into an alkena solution in methanol at a temperature of \u25aa78 \u00b0C to a solution producing a typical blue color, caused by an nonresponsive ozone. The blue signifies that the alkena has been consumed entirely. As an alternative, various other chemicals can be used as a final point indicator to detect the existence of the ozone. If ozonealysis is done by inflating the oxygen-riched ozone flow throughout the mixture of reactions, the gas that boils out can be directed through a solution of potassium iodide. When the solution has stopped absorbing the ozone, the ozone in the bubble oxidizes iodide into iodine, which can easily be observed by the resulting purple. Once the addition of the reaction is completed then the ozone addition is remade to convert the substance between the ozoneides into carbonil derivatives. Reductive conditions are far more common than oxidative conditions.

After its stand again in Constantinople in 330 C.E., it served as the capital of the empire for nearly 16 centuries, during the Roman and Byzantine or Eastern Roman Empire (330 questioned 1212041453), Latin (1204 JULI1261), and Utsmanid or Ottoman (1453 JULY1922). The city played an important role in the development of Christianity during the Roman and Byzantine Empire before Utsmaniyah conquered it in 1453 and turned it into an Islamic stronghold and the seat of Utsmaniyah's Empire. Istanbul's strategic position on the historic Silk Road, railway networks to Europe and the Middle East, and the only sea lane between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean, has produced a cosmopolitan population though somewhat reduced since the establishment of the Turkish Republic in 1923. Having been neglected because of the new capital during the interwar period, the city regained its vital position.",

Various cultural, film, music, and art festivals were held at the end of the 20th century and remained held by the city to this day, while infrastructure repairs have produced a complex transportation network. About 12.56 million foreign tourists visited Istanbul in 2015, five years after its establishment as a European Cultural Capital, which made this city the fifth most popular tourist destination in the world. The city's main attraction is its historical center, some of which are listed as the UNESCO World Heritage Site; its entertainment and cultural centers are along the natural port of the city, the Golden Horn, in the Beyo\u011flu District. Viewed as a global city, Istanbul has one of the fastest growing metropolitan economys in the world. The city became home to the headquarters of many Turkish companies and media and contributed more than a quarter of the country's gross domestic products. To make good use of its rapid revitalization and expansion, Istanbul has volunteered to organize the Summer Olympics five times in twenty years. The first known name was Byzantium (Greek: \u25aa\u03bd\u03bd\u03bd, Byz\u00e1ntion; English: Byzantium), the name was given at the time of its stand by settlers in Median about 660 B.C.E. The Byzantine name is thought to have come from a person's name, Byzas. Ancient Greek tradition refers to a linear king by that name as the leader of the Greek settlers. Modern experts have also estimated that this Byzas was either a local Thrakia or originally from Iliria, and hence existed before the Megarian settlement.",

Slovenia bordered Italy in the west, Austria in the north, Hungary in the northeast, Croatia in the southeast, and the Adriatic Sea in the southwest. Slovenia is dominated by mountains and forests, with an area of 20,271 square miles [20,271 sq km], and with a population of 2,107,007 people, 300,000 of whom reside in the largest city and government center, Ljubljana. Slovenian Ethnics form the absolute majority of the country's population. Slovenian, one of the members of the Southern Slav language, is official. Slovenia has a climate dominated by the continent, with exceptions to coastal regions and Julian's Alps. The sub-mediate climate reaches an extension north of the Diari Alps that rotates the country in the northwest-northeast direction. Julian's northwest Alps have an Alps climate. The continent's climate is getting clearer towards the Pannonian Basin in the Northeast. The largest city and central government, Ljubljana, lies in the middle of the country. Slovenia historically became the crossroads of Slavic, German, and Roman cultures. The region that was now Slovenian was once part of many different countries: the Roman Empire, the Byzantine Empire, the Karoling Empire, the Holy Roman Empire, the Hungarian Empire, the Venice Republic, the provinces of Iliria in Napoleon's First Empire, the Austrian Empire and the Austria-Hongaria Empire. In October 1918, Slovenians helped to establish Slovenian, Croatian, and Serbian countries. In December 1918, they joined the Serbian Empire into the Yugoslavian Kingdom.

Perception covers all signals in the nervous system, which is the result of the physical or chemical stimulation of the visor organ. Like visions that are light about the retina in the eye, kissers that use the media of smell molecules (aromas), and hearing that involves sound waves. Perception is not passive gesture acceptance, but is shaped by learning, memory, hope, and attention. Perception depends on the complex functions of the nervous system, but it doesn't seem to exist because it happens outside of consciousness. Since the discovery of psychological experiments in the 19th century, psychological understanding of perceptions has evolved through a combination of techniques. In the field of psychophysics, it has been categorically explained the relationship between the physics of stimuli and perception. The sensory neuroscience is studying the mechanisms of the brain underlying perception. The perception system can also be learned through computing, from the information processed by the system. Perception in philosophy is the extent to which sensory elements such as sound, aroma, or color exist in an objective reality, not in the perceptor mind. In learning perception we also need to know about the constantness of perception (consistency), which is constant perception influenced by experience. That constant perception includes shapes, sizes, and colors. One example of perception constantity, which is that when we drink milk in dark places, we won't call the milk black, but we'll still call the milk color white even in the dark that's not visible.

That's what's called constant perception, we give perception of an object based on previous experiences. Relationship theory is an attempt when individuals observe behavior to determine whether it's caused internally or externally. The halo effect is to create a general picture of an individual based on a characteristic. When making a general impression about an individual based on a characteristic, such as intelligence, hospitality, or appearance, the halo effect is at work. The reality of the halo effect is reinforced in a study, which is that when the perpetrators are given a list of such qualities as clever, skilled, practical, industrious, diligent, and friendly, they are asked to evaluate individuals with those qualities. When those qualities are used, those individuals are considered wise, humorous, popular, and imaginative. When the same list is modified, a completely different range of perceptions are often confused with sensations. The sensation is only a brief impression, when the stimulus is newly accepted by the brain and has not been organized with other stimulus and the memories associated with the stimulus. For example, it's a rough table, which means a sensation in the touch of the table. On the other hand, perceptions have an uncomfortable table example to write on, when the brain gets a rough-knuckle stimulus of table, visions of a table that's scribbling, and memories of the past using a table that's similar and then the writing becomes ugly. The process of understanding about the gills or stimulus acquired by the senses causes perception to divide into several types of visual perceptions obtained from the sense of sight.

Although all isotopes of certain elements have almost the same chemical properties, they have different atomic mass and different physical properties. The term isotope is formed from the root of the Greek word isos, and topos, meaning \"the same place\"; thus, the meaning behind the name is that the different isotopes of an element occupy the same position on the periodic table. This term was created by Scottish physician and author Margaret Todd in 1913 in a suggestion to British chemist Frederick Soddy. The number of protons in the atomic nucleus is called the atomic number and is equal to the number of electrons in a neutral atom (unionized). Each atomic number identifies a particular element, but not its isotope; an atom of certain elements may have a wide range of neutrons. The number of nuclones in the nucleus is the atomic mass number, and each isotope of certain elements has a different mass number. For example, carbon-12, carbon-13, and carbon-14 are three isotopes of carbon elements with mass numbers of 12, 13, and 14. The number of carbon atoms is 6, which means that each carbon atom has 6 protons, so the number of neutrons of those isotopes is 6, 7, and 8, in a row. Nuclides are atomic species with a certain number of protons and neutrons in their nucleus, for example, carbon-13 with 6 protons and 7 neutrons.",

The number of neutrons has a huge effect on the core properties, but its effect on chemical properties can be overlooked for most of the elements. Even for the lightest elements, the ratio of neutron numbers to the most diverse atomic number between isotopes, usually has only small effects (for some of its hydrogens, the lightest elements, the isotope effect is large enough to affect its biology strongly). The term isotopic (starting also isotopic element, now sometimes nuclide isotope) means to imply comparison (like synonym or isomer). For example, nuklida 126C, 136C, 146C is an isotope (nuklida with the same atomic number but different mass numbers), but 4018Ar, 4019K, 4020Ca is the isobar (nuklida with the same mass number). However, isotope is an older and more familiar term than nuclide and is sometimes still used in a context where nuclides may be more precise, such as nuclear technology and nuclear medicine. An isotope and/or nuclide is determined by the name of a specific element (this shows the atomic number) followed by a link and a mass number (e.g. helium-3, helium-4, carbon-12, carbon-14, uranium-235 and uranium-239). When a chemical symbol is used, for example, \"C\" for carbon, the standard notation (now known as \"AZE notation\" because A is a mass number, Z is an atomic number, and E is an element) is used to show a mass number (number of nuclei) with a superscript on the top of the chemical element and to show the atomic number with the subscript on the bottom (e.g. 32He, 42He, 126, 146C, 23592U, and 2399U).",

These fields include the application of mathematical, statistical, and informal methods to solve biological problems, especially using DNA sequences and amino acids and information related to them. Examples of the main topic of this field include databases for managing biological information, sequential alignment (sequence alignment), predicting structures to predict the shape of proteins and secondary structures of RNA, filogenetic analysis, and gene expression analysis. The bioinformatics term began in the mid 1980s to refer to the application of computers in biology. However, the application of fields in bioinformatics (such as the creation of databases and development of algorithms for biological sequence analysis) has been done since the 1960s. The advances in molecular biology in uncovering biological sequences of proteins (from the early 1950s) and nucleic acids (since the 1960s) preceded the development of biological databases and sequenced analysis techniques. Protein sequence databases began to develop in the 1960s in the United States, while DNA sequenced databases were developed in the late 1970s in the United States and Germany (in European Molecular Biology Laboratory, European Molecular Biology Laboratory). The discovery of faster DNA sequencing techniques in the mid 1970s became the site of an explosion of sequences of DNA that were successfully expressed in the 1980s and 1990s, becoming one of the openings for genome revelation projects, increasing the need for sequential management and analysis, and ultimately causing bioinformic birth. Internet developments also support the development of bioinformatics. Bioinformatic databases connected via the Internet make it easier for scientists to collect the results of sequencing into the database as well as to obtain biological sequences as analysis material.

All three databases work together and exchange data daily to keep the scope of each database wide. The main source of nucleic acid sequence data is direct submission from individual researchers, genome sequencing projects, and patent registration. Besides containing nucleic acid sequences, entries in the nucleic acid sequence generally contain information about the nucleic acid type (DNA or RNA), the name of the nucleic acid source organism, and the library associated with the nucleic acid sequence. Meanwhile, the examples of several important databases that hold primary protein sequences are permanent nonactive PIRpranalas (Protein Information Resource, United States), Switzerland-Prot (Eropa), and TreMBL (Eropa).

Necrosis is caused by external factors of cells or tissues, such as infections, toxins, or trauma that result in irregular digestive cells. Instead, apoptosis is a natural and targeted cause of cell death. While apoptosis often has a favorable effect on organisms, necrosis is almost always harmful and can be fatal. Cellular deaths resulting from necrosis do not follow apoptosis signal transduced path; receptors are activated resulting in loss of cell membrane integrity and releasing uncontrolled cell product to extracellular space. This event triggers an inflammatory response in the surrounding network, pulling leukocytes and phagocytes close to killing dead cells with phagocytes. However, microbial damage released by leukocytes will do additional damage to the surrounding tissue. This excessive collateral damage inhibits the healing process. Untreated necrosis thus produces a pile of tissues and debris of rotting cells at or near the site of cell death. The classic example is gangrene. For this reason, it is often necessary to remove necrotic tissue by surgery, a procedure known as debridemen. Structural signs that show irreversible cell injuries and necrosis development include solid lumps and progressive genetic material disorders, as well as disturbances in cell and organelle membranes. There are six typical morphological patterns of necrosis: Necrosis can occur because of external or internal factors. External factors can include mechanical trauma (the physical damage that causes cellular damage), blood vessels (that can disrupt blood supply to related tissues), and ischemia.

Necrosis can be activated by immune components, such as the complementary system; bacterial toxins; naturally activated natural killer cells, and peritoneal macrophags. The induced necrosis program in the cell with immunology barriers can reduce the pathogen's invasion through the surface affected by inflammatory. Poisons and pathogens can cause necrosis; such toxins as snake venom can inhibit enzymes and cause cell death. Necrotic wounds are also produced by the sting of Vespa mandarinia. Pathological conditions are marked by a lack of cytokine secretion. The nitrate oxide (NO) and the reactive oxygen species (ROS) are also accompanied by cell necrotic deaths. A classic example of the necrotic condition of ischemia that leads to a drastic thinning of oxygen, glucose, and other trophy factors and induces the massive death of endotel cells and cells that do not proliferate from the surrounding tissue (neurons, cardiomiocytes, kidney cells, etc.). The recent sitology data shows that necrotic deaths occurred not only during pathological events but also a component of some physiological processes. The leading lymphocyte-T activation of death and other important constituents of immune responses are morphologically free-caspase and necrotic; therefore, present researchers have shown that necrotic cell deaths can occur not only during the path of pathology but also during normal processes such as tissue updates, embryogenesis, and immune response.

Burning temperature is approximately 1000 \u00b0C. Condensation of the clay, makes the work yellow, orange, red, \"the city\", pink, gray, or brown. Burned Terokota doesn't make it waterproof. But rubbing on the surface before it burns can reduce its absorption rate and the terracity can be added to the glacier to make it waterproof. The results are suitable for carrying water (usually in ancient times), for farming equipment or for building decorations in tropical environments, and for oil storage containers, oil lamps, or ovens. Most of the other uses are for eating and drinking utensils, plumbing, or decorations in cold environments that require the materials that are combed.",

The atoms in the solids are solidly bound to each other, both in the geometry en regular (crystal solids, which include metal and ice) and irregular (morph solids like regular window glass). The branch of physics dealing with solids is called solid physics, and it is the main branch of condensed physics (which also includes liquid). The main concerns of matter science are the properties of physics and chemical solids. The chemistry of solid matter focuses on the synthesis of new materials, as well as analysis and chemical composition. Atoms, molecules or ions that make solids may be arranged in regular, irregular, or irregular patterns. The material whose constituents are arranged in a regular pattern is known as crystals. In some ways, regular settings can continue unbroken on a large scale, such as diamonds, where each diamond is a single crystal. Solid objects large enough to be seen and dealt rarely consist of single crystals, but made of a large number of single crystals, known as crystallites, whose size varies from several nanometers to several feet. This kind of material is called a polycristal. Almost all metals that are often found, and many ceramics, are polycristal. In other materials, there is no sequence of long-range atomic positions.

In the science of materials, the composite of more than one constituent material can be designed to have the desired nature. The force between atoms in solids can take a wide range of shapes. For example, sodium chloride crystals are composed of sodium and chlorin ions, coupled together by ionic bonds. In diamonds or silicones, atoms share electrons and form covalent bonds. In metals, electrons belong together in metal bonds. Some solids, especially organic compounds, are put together by the van der Waals force produced from polarizing the charge of electron clouds on each molecule. The difference between kinds of solids is the result of the difference in their bond. Metals are usually strong, solid, and electric and good heat carriers. Very many elements of the periodic table, which is to the left of the virtual monotonous line, are metal.

Walker's circulation is caused by a force of pressure gradients derived from one high - air pressure area in the eastern Pacific Ocean and one low - air pressure area in Indonesia's Arkipelago region. During the summer period of the northern hemisphere, Walker's circulation in the tropical part of the Indian Ocean caused a temporary west wind to blow on the surface of the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic to blow east. The temperature of the three oceans became asymmetrical as well. The equatorial regions of the Pacific and the Atlantic also have cool surface temperatures in the east while in the Indian Ocean, cooler waters in the west. The surface temperature collapse is also associated with the change in the depth position of the thermocline. The changes in Walker's circulatory motion occur at the same time as the change in surface temperature. These changes can result from external factors such as the change in seasons with the motions of the Sun. The change in the Walker Circulation movement is also due to a mutual relationship between the oceans and the atmosphere. For example, the east wind causes sea level temperatures in the east to cool off. The eastern region is getting colder, making the east wind go faster. The variation of the east wind conditions triggered more upwelling and made the thermoclin in the east rise and the surface temperature became colder that increased the initial cooling effect of the previous south wind. This bond between the oceans and the atmosphere was first proposed by meteorologist Jacob Bjerknes. From an oceanography standpoint, the cold region around the equator is caused by the east wind.",

The development of digital health technology has enabled everyone to study and evaluate themselves, and to participate actively in the promotional health movement. Social factors affect health conditions, such as individual behavior, social, genetic and biological conditions, health care, and physical environment. The meaning of health has developed over time. In the perspective of biomedical models, the initial definition of health is focused on the body's ability to function. Health is viewed as a normal functioning condition that can be disturbed by disease from time to time. In 1958, the World Health Organization (WHO) defined health as \"the physical, mental, and social welfare, and not just the absence of disease and weakness.\" Although this definition is well received by some and is viewed as innovative, it is also criticized for being obscure, too broad, and is not measured. Some scientists present another definition of health, such as \"conditions marked by anatomy integrity; the ability to do a role in family, work, and society, which are personally valued; the ability to deal with physical, biological, and social pressures; the sense of well - being; and freedom from the risk of disease and predetermined death.\" In time, disease is no longer viewed as a condition, but it is a process. This shift in perspective also occurs in health. In the early 1980s, WHO encouraged the progression of the health promotional movement. This movement allows people to improve their control over their health and improve their individual health status. To bring about the complete state of physical, mental, and social well - being, as WHO defines health, a person or a group needs to have the ability to identify and realize aspirations, meet needs, and change or address the environment.",

Understanding the concept of health as \"the ability to adapt and self-organize\" and the growing digital health technology has opened the door for everyone to judge themselves.

In time, the term \"healthy\" has also been widely used in the context of lifeless organizations that affect human interests, such as in healthy communities, healthy cities, or healthy environments.

According to WHO, social health determination is the condition that people experience when they're born, grow, work, live, and age, as well as a series of broader forces and systems that shape everyday living conditions. These conditions are formed by distribution of money, power, and resources at a global, national, and local level. It's very responsible for health gaps, both in countries and countries.

The United Nations projects that half of the world's population will be living in urban areas by the end of 2008. It is estimated that by 2050, about 64% of developing countries and 86% of developed countries will be urbanized. That's equal to about 3 billion cities by 2050, most of which are going to happen in Africa and Asia. In particular, the United Nations has also recently projected that almost all global population growth from 2017 to 2030 will be absorbed by cities, about 1.1 billion new cities over the next 13 years. Urbanization is relevant to various disciplines, including geography, sociology, economics, urban planning, and public health. This phenomenon is closely associated with modernization, industrialization, and sociological processes like rationalization. Urbanization can be seen as a special condition at the appointed time (e. g. the total proportion of the population or area of the city) or as an increase in the condition over time.

Urbanization creates huge social, economic and environmental changes, which provides an opportunity for sustainability with \"potenance to use resources more efficiently, to create more sustainable land and to protect natural ecosystem biodiversity.\" Urbanization is not only a modern phenomenon, but it is also a historical transformation of human social roots that are fast and historic on a global scale, where rural culture is rapidly being replaced by the more dominant urban culture.",

CMOS technology is also used in many analog circuits, such as image sensors, data modifiers, and trimancars integrated for various types of communication. Frank Wanlass patented CMOS in 1967 (US Patent 3,356,858). CMOS is also often called Complementary-symmetry metal. The complementor-symmetrical words refer to the fact that usually the CMOS based digital design uses a complex and symmetrical pair of MOSFET semiconductors of type-p and semiconductor types for logic functions. Two important characters of CMOS are his high-thrust immunity and low-use of static power. Power was only taken when transistors in CMOS moved between living conditions and dying. As a result, the CMOS device does not generate as much material as other logic circuits, such as transistor-transistor logic (TTL) or NMOS logic, which only uses type-n devices without type-p. CMOS also allows logic chips with high density are created. The sentence \"methal-oxide-semiconductionor\" or semiconductor-logum-oxide is a term on the physical structure of some field effects transistor, having a metal electrode gate located above the metal oxide insulator, which is also above the semiconductor material.

The device is commonly referred to as a chip, whereas it is also referred to as a die or dice. The principal principle behind the CMOS litar that makes it possible to use the logic gates is the use of MOSFET type-p and type-n to make the way to output from the voltage source or the ground. When the path to output is made from a source of voltage, this line is called pull-up. On the other hand, the litar is declared pull-down if the road to output is made from Earth. CMOS lines are designed in such a way that all PMOS transistors must have input from either the voltage source or from other PMOS transistors. Similarly, all NMOS transistors must have input from ground or other NMOs transistors. Composition of the PMOS transistor raises a low resistance when low voltage is imposed on him, and a high resistance when high voltage is applied to him. On the other hand, the composition of the NMOS transistor resulted in a high resistance when low voltage was imposed on him, and a low resistance when high voltage was imposed on him. The image on the left shows what happens when an insert is connected to the PMOS transistor and NMOS transistor.

Galliera's institution, on Fleury's hill, was founded by the Duke of Galliera as an orphanage. This building was completed in 1885. The old castle of Meudon was rebuilt in a Renaissance style in the middle of the 16th century. Purchased by Louis XIV as the home of Louis, le Grand Dauphin, under which Meudon became the center of aristocratic life. After the death of le Grand Dauphin in 1711 this ch\u00e2teau was ignored, emptied during the Revolutionary sale, and finally burned at the end of the French-Prusian War, 1871, after occupied by the Prussian army. The Paris Observatory branch was founded in 1877 above the ruins. The city hall of Meudon stands 43m above Paris and has a promising view of Paris above the observatory. Despite being a district of choice dwellings, access by train (RER) and the Seine has made Meudon a production center since the 1840s. Iron products and military explosives have been produced here ever since. In addition to the Observatory, there is also oneRA, a national institute of study of flights (and wind tunnels), has been established since the military opened a static airfield (lighter than air) in Chalais park in 1877.",

It's restricted to produce certain formulas. Science gives certainty by limiting the scope of its vision, and the certainty of science comes from its limitations. Science is not mere knowledge, but it sums up a collection of knowledge based on agreed theories and can be systematically tested by a set of recognized methods in certain fields of science. Viewed from a philosophical point of view, science is formed because humans try to think further about the knowledge they have. Science is a product of epistemology, in other words the sciences form from three branches of philosophy that is ontology, epistemology and axiology, if these three branches are fulfilled meaning legitimate and recognized as a science. Natural science can only be certain once the field is limited to the material, or psychological science can only predict human behavior if the scope of his views is limited to the general facet of concrete human behavior. With this example, science answers the question of the distance of the sun and the earth, or psychological science answers whether a woman is fit to be a nurse. The Arabic word for science \"im\" which means understanding, understanding, or knowing. In the context of his words, science can mean understanding a science, and social science can mean knowing social problems, and so on. Unlike science, science is a special knowledge of what causes something and why. There's a scientific requirement for something called science. The scientific requirements of science are much affected by the paradigm of the natural world that predates it.",

Scientists use model terms to explain things, specifically which can be used to make guesses that can be tested by conducting experiments or observations. A hypothesis is an unsupported or proven guesswork, and the laws of physics or the laws of nature are a scientific generalization based on empirical observation. Math is very important for science, especially in the role it plays in expressing scientific models. Observing and gathering the results of measurements, as makes hypothesis and conjecture, must require mathematical models and exploitation. The math branches that are often used in science include calculus and statistics, although actually all math branches have their applications, even pure fields such as number theory and topology. Some thinkers view mathematicians as scientists, assuming that mathematical proofs equal experiment. Some don't consider mathematics a science, because it doesn't require experimental tests on its theories and hypothesiss. But, despite both assumptions, the fact that mathematics is a very useful tool to describe the universe has become a major issue for mathematical philosophy. Look Eugene Wigner, The Unresonable Effectiveness of Mathematics. Richard Feynman said, \"Mathematics is not real, but it feels real. Where is it? \"while Bertrand Russell loved to define mathematics as \"a subject we never knew what we were talking about, and we don't know the truth.\" In philosophy, science includes the type of actionden in relation categories. In science, there are subjects that know and objects that are known. Relation between these two is called science. This view is supported by Fkhruddin Ar-Razi.

At the beginning of its history, writing was done using pictures, such as the hieroglyphs of ancient Egypt. Writings with characters appeared some 5,000 years ago. A lot of Sumerians are creating signs on clay. They represent sounds, different from hieroglyphs that represent words or objects. Writing has been booming since the invention of printing techniques, causing people to get more and more involved in writing because their literature is easy to publish. Along with technological and media developments, writing also contributes to the world's growth. Through electronic media, each person can obtain writing material from the Internet. This has made authors more efficient in making use of the time, cost, and energy to write. Nowadays authors can also share everything they write wherever they are using Internet-based technology. As well as the readers, it would be easier to look at the authors' writings that they enjoy. Writing results in writing that has four elements - ideas, speech, order, and rides. Ideas are a topic owned by a writing. A topic relates to past experiences or knowledge owned by writers. The topic is presented in writing in the form of opinion, experience or knowledge. Speech is an idea that a reader can understand. The type of speech is generally divided into descriptions, persuasions, narratives, arguments and expositions. Settings are a code that must be met when ideas are expressed during writing. Writers must write according to the order that applies in a writing.",

The number of rides used during writing depends on the level of mastery of meaning and the number of words known to the writer. Writing in general has a goal of giving direction, explaining, relating, summarizing and convincing the reader by means of the text. Our readers can find direction in writing in the form of guidelines, instructions or information. Writing with a view to explaining the meaning of writing provides information that a reader needs to know. Writing is also meant to tell of an incident that once occurred in the form of information. Meanwhile, writing to sum up means that writing can be done to shorten the existing contents of writing without eliminating the ideas inside. Writing to convince the reader means writing was made to make the reader agree or agree with written ideas. Writers have different writing skills. This difference is largely influenced by the life background of the writer or the abilities and needs of the writing reader. Based on the seriousness of the matter, writing is distinguished into serious writing and casual writing. Serious writing is a writing activity that requires a high degree of care along with a high level of concentration. One example is writing a essay. On the other hand, casual writing is a matter of writing that simply makes writing and does not require a high concentration. For example, it's writing a short message. Writing was generally hindered by the author's doubts about the writing he wrote. This form of writing doubt is divided into anxiety over the writing produced, running out of ideas and fears as a result of the idea rivalry with other writers.",

This teaching teaches that God the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit are sightings of abstract and unreachable weakness. In other words, God is one and only. But the Son of God and the Holy Spirit is nothing but a manifestation of God. The people who became human, suffering and rising up were God (Father) himself. Hence, sometimes Christianism is referred to as patripasionism, which means that the Father is suffering. The followers of this teaching are called the monarchs. This is because they hold fast to the oneness and the oneness of God. In fact, monarchy arose in an effort to avoid the polytheism that occurred in the second century. The inclination to polytheism came from the church that was then transformed from the Palestinian mind's realm into the Greek mind. This teaching is divided into two: Dynamic monarchism and Modalistist monarchism. According to dynamic monarchy, in humans Jesus worked a force or a divine force but an imperial one. This view considers Jesus to be the Son of God. Jesus was not truly God but a divine man. The human Jesus at the time of his baptism or at the time of his resurrection was adopted as the Son of God. The Monarkians regard this as God's activity or energy. The character of dynamic monarchy is Theodotus of Byzantium. Capitalistic monarchism also clings to the unity and singleness of God. God is one person and the Son and the Holy Spirit is another way God appears to him. This view is trying to remove the difference between the Father and the Son.",

Volcano on Earth was formed because its crust had been split into 17 major plate tectonics that were stiff and floating over a layer of warmer and softer coats. Hence, volcanoes on Earth are often found at the divergent and converging boundaries of tectonic plates. Volcanoes don't usually form in two tectonic plates that shift from one to another. The dangers of volcanic dust are against jet flights in particular because they can damage turbines from jet engines. Large eruptions can affect temperatures because the smoke and sulfuric acid pellets emitted by eruptions can block the sun and cool the lower part of the earth's atmosphere like the troposphere, but they can also absorb the heat emitted from the earth and heat the stratosphere. Further, the term \"Mountain of Fire\" is also used to name the ice volcano formation phenomenon (ice mountain) and mud volcano (mountain of mud fire). Ice volcanoes are common in high latitudes that have snowy winters. Volcanoes are found all over the world, but the best - known location of the volcano is that along the bow of the Pacific Ring of Fire (Pacific Ring of Fire).

But the volcano was able to rest in a very long time, more than thousands of years before it turned active again. Volcanic eruptions occur when magma rises across the earth's crust and emerges above the surface. When the volcano erupts, the magma contained in the magma chamber beneath the volcano erupts out as lava, where this lava can turn into lava after it flows and mixes with the materials on the surface of the Earth. Apart from the lava flow, the destruction caused by volcanic eruptions. The science that studies volcanoes is called Vulcanology, where this science studies volcanic eruptions for the purpose of predicting the possibility of volcanic eruptions, so the negative impact of volcanic eruptions can be suppressed. Volcanoes on Earth form from plate tectonic activity in the crust that rubs and suppresses each other. Hence many volcanoes were found near the plate border of tectonics. Geologically, the region where volcanoes are formed is divided by three, which is: If the two plate tectonics move away from each other, then the new ocean crust will form from a magma exit to the ocean floor. The region between these two distant plates is named after the divergen boundary. This activity will then bring up the mid-ocean ridge formed from the cooling of the magma that appears to the surface. Volcanoes formed of this activity are under the sea, marked by hydrothermal ventilation phenomena. If this mid-ocean ridge reaches the surface of the ocean, then volcanic islands will form, for example, Iceland.",

Cables began to be discovered when humans needed a useful tool to connect a device to another device, and were found in the early 1400s. The process of inventing these wires is not the same as one type of cable with another wire. The discovery of copper cables required the longest process compared to the rest of the cables, which led to the discovery of a telephone. The discovery of colaxial cables follows the discovery of copper cables. Recently, colaxial cables have been refined with the invention of a very thin Optic Fiber cable and the ability to transmit light signals. Copper cables are shared over UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair) and STP (Shielded Twisted Pair). The difference between these two is that there's a barrier and there's no protection in the core of the conductor. The UTP cable consists of four pairs of wires with different networks every inch. The higher the rate of transmission, the higher the price. This UTP cable uses the RJ-45 connector commonly used for Eternet,ISDN, or mobile connection.

For example, gods are born because men are also born, and that gods wear garments, voices, and human appearances. Xenophanes gave the argument according to the evidence he found: Xenophanes could conclude that anthropomorphism of gods was not appropriate because he had traveled all over the place and had seen their various beliefs. Therefore, he became convinced that these were not the right concepts of gods. It states that there's actually only \"One That Covers All.\" The point here is similar to the concept of \"God\" but it's not the same as monotheism because it's also called plural. According to Xenophanes, \"One encompasses All\" is not born and has no end, meaning eternal. It's different from the concepts of gods that are born and can die.

CBBC is primarily intended for audiences of 6 to 12 years; a brother channel known as CBeebies serves a preschooler. CBBC was awarded Channel of the Year of the Children's BAPHTA Awards in November 2008 and 2015. This channel averages 300,000 viewers every day. This channel originally shared the width of the ribbon on the Freeview platform with BBC Knowledge, and then BBC Three, which required that the CBBC stop its broadcast at 7: 00 p.m. per day. Starting on April 11, 2016, after closing BBC Three linear television service, CBBC extended its broadcast to two hours a day. On August 22, 2008, the BBC announced that the channel would be available directly on its site starting on September 16th. The CBBC range is growing as we add more channels to the Sky Republic of Ireland on May 12, 2011. On March 27, 2013, CBBC was brought by the British Army Broadcast Service (BFBS), sharing channels with BBC Two. Along with CBBC, CBBC channels are operated by BBC Children's Department on BBC and are part of BBC North groups. BBC Children originally based on the East Tower BBC Center Television since the beginning of the department, but moving to MediaCITYUK in Salford in September 2011, and the direct presentation relationship used throughout the day is now being recorded and broadcast from there. This channel is responsible for CBBC control, Damian Kavanagh, in the mail since 2009, and to the director of BBC Child, Joe Godwin, who was appointed in 2009 and paid for the entire direction of the channel and its strand partners.",

Spectroscopy can also be defined as a science that studies the interaction between light and matter. In historical records, spectroscopy refers to a branch of science where visible spectrums are used in the theories of matter structures as well as qualitative and qualitative analysis. In modern times, spectroscopy definitions developed as new techniques developed to exploit not only visible spectrums, but also other forms of electromagnetic radiation and non-electromagnetic radiation such as microwaves, radio waves, electrons, phnons, pulses and x-rays. Spectroscopy is commonly used in physical and chemical analysis to identify a substance through emitted or absorbed spectrum. A device to record the spectrum is called a spectrometer. Spectroscopy is also used intensively in astronomy and remote sensing. Most large telescopes have spectrographs used to measure the chemical composition and other physical attributes of an astronomical object or to measure the speed of an astronomical object based on the Doppler effect on spectral lines. The type of spectroscopy depends on a measured physical quantity. The quantity measured is the amount or intensity of something. Spectroscopy is used in analytic physical and chemical chemistry to detect, determine, or measure molecular composition and sample structure. Each type of molecule and atom will reflect, absorb, or emit electromagnetic radiation in its own way. Spectroscopy uses these characteristics to conclude and analyze sample composition. The spectroscopy application in photobiology. Photobiologists use a number of spectrosocopic techniques to understand how the photobiological process occurs. The technique is done by identifying a primary photoactive molecular entity that's excreted by the absorption of light energy triggers biological effects.",

The spectroscopy application is in astronomy. Using special tools such as spectrographs or spectrosocopy, astronomers can divide light from space into spectrums and check the spectral lines so that they can conclude what compounds are emitted or absorbed. Furthermore, astronomers can also study the density and temperature of a compound that emits or absorbs and what the power of a magnetic field in the environment where light is emitted or absorbed. Spectroscopy has been used in the study that most stars are made of hydrogen, Saturn satellite has methane in its atmosphere, that comets contain a lot of water, and so on. The spectroscopy application in Biomedical Science. The biomedical use of light consists of many applications for medical diagnosis and therapy. The photon flytime spectroscopy can help with certain therapeutic methods by providing data on optical properties that regulate network responses. The spectroscopy ultraungu is a type of spectroscopy accompaniment where light areas of ultra-violet (200-400 nanometers) are absorbed by molecules that produce electron excitation from basic states to higher energy levels. There are some principles of ultraungu spectroscopy, among them: This typical ultraungu spectroscopy application: One type of spectroscopy is infrared spectroscopy. This spectroscopy is based on the vibration of a molecule. The infrared spectroscopy detects frequencies of infrared light absorbed by molecules. They tend to absorb specific light frequencies because they match the frequency of vibrational bonds in molecules. The red Infra spectroscopy can use samples in solid, liquid, or gas.",

By ordinary people, the word \"arithmetics\" is often regarded as synonyms of the number theory. Please look at the numbers to know more about the number theory. The arithmetic prehistory is limited to a small number of artifacts, which can point to the concept of addition and reduction, the most famous is the Ishango bone of Central Africa, coming from somewhere between 20,000 and 18 thousand B.C.E., despite its debated interpretation. The earliest written records indicate that Egypt and Babylon used all basic arithmetic operations since 2000 B.C.E. This artifact does not always reveal specific processes used to solve problems, but the characteristics of certain number systems strongly affect the complexity of methods. The hieroglyph system for the Egyptian numerals, such as later the Roman numerals, was derived from the counting marks used to calculate. In both cases, these origins produce values that use decimal bases, but do not include position notation. A complex account of Roman numerals requires help from the Roman countboard (or swipoa) to obtain results. The initial number system that includes position notation is not decimal, including the sexagecimal system for Babylonian numerals, and the vigesimal system (biss 20) that determines Maya's numbers. Because of the concept of the value of this place, the ability to reuse the same numbers for different values contributes to simpler, more efficient calculations in historical development of modern arithmetic beginning with Hellenistic civilizations from ancient Greece, although longer from the examples of Babylon and Egypt.

To place thousands, they would reuse symbols for unit places, and so on. Their addition algorithms are identical to modern methods, and the multiplication algorithms are just slightly different. Algorithm splits were the same length, and square-digit square algorithms, popularly used recently in the 20th century, were known by Archimedes (who may have found it). He chose it over Heron's method of consecutive estimates because, after calculations, a digit did not change, and the square root of the square is perfect, like 7485692.

The ancient Chinese had advanced arithmetic studies from the Shang Dynasty and continued to the Tang Dynasty, from basic to advanced algebra. The ancient Chinese used notation positions similar to those of the Greeks. Because they also lack symbols for zero, they have a set of symbols for unit places, and a second set for tens.

Atanasius used this term to assert that although the Father and the Son are eternally different from the oknum (so that they can love each other, in harmony with nas John 3:35 and 14:31), both remain one, one matter, one quality, or one substance, with one personal spirit.

In detail, the abootic component is a physical and chemical state around organisms that become mediums and substrates to sustain the organism's life. Some examples of abiotic components are water, air, sunlight, soil, topography, and climate. Almost every living thing needs water. Thus, water is a vital component of life. Most of the living bodies are made up of water and none of the living creatures don't need water. Nevertheless, the need for organisms for water is not the same as that of one another. Likewise, water supply in one area is not equal to one area and another. It will also affect the way organisms live in those areas. For example, animals living in desert areas will have relatively little water capacity as adjustments to their water - poor environment. The variety of plants that exist also adapt to these conditions, one of which forms thick, narrow leaves that reduce evaporation, for example, is cactus vegetation. Air is vital for life on earth. Oxygen is needed for humans and animals to breathe or the carbondioxide that plants need for photosynthesis is also derived from the air. Even the earth is protected by an atmosphere that is a layer of air. An air condition is directly influenced by sunlight, humidity, and temperature.

Sunlight is the main source of all living things' energy, because with it plants can photosynthesis. While the presence of water vapor in the air will affect the speed of evaporation from the body's surface of the organism. Organisms that live in hot areas (high air temperature and low humidity) will try to reduce internal water evaporation, such as camels that are typical of desert animals. Whereas polar bears, living in a very cold environment, adapt to having thick hair. In addition to the difference in temperature, air flow can be created by pressure differences. So the organism will adapt to that condition. Take plants, for example. Plants that live in strong winds, coastal areas, for example, form strong coiling systems and elastic stems so that they do not break easily in the wind. For example, the plant is a shrimp pine. The existence of an ecosystem is also influenced by soil conditions. When the earth contains only rocks and metals, with no soil, there will be no other kinds of plants and organisms. Land is a home for various organisms, especially plants. The existence of plants will make one region have various plant - eating organisms and other organisms that eat them.

In contrast to today's and its subcontinental mass, most of Pangea is in the southern hemisphere and surrounded by the super-sea, Panthalasta. Pangea is the most recent supercontinent that ever existed and was first reconstructed by geologists. The name Pangea is derived from Ancient Greece, the \"all\" pan and Gaia meaning \"earth.\" The name was created in the 1927 symposium discussed by Alfred Wegener about the theory of the shift of the continent. In his book The Origin of Continents and Oceans (Die Entstehung der Continente und Ozear), first published in 1915, he guessed that all continents at one time had once formed a single supercontinent that he called \"Urcontinent\", before it broke out and drifted away to their current location. Pangea's existence was first proposed in 1912, however, long before the discovery of these tools developed the modern theory of tectonic plates. German Meteorologist Alfred Wegener, first presented the concept of Pangea (which means \"all land\") along with the first comprehensive theory of continent shifting, the idea that the continents on earth are slowly moving relatively towards each other, at a conference in 1912 and then in his book The Origins of Continents and Oceans (1915). Like a handful of other scientists who came before him, like 19th-century German naturalists Alexander von Humboldt, Wegener became impressed by the similarities of the eastern American coastline and western Africa and wondered if \"those lands had ever been combined together,\" he said.",

Wegener shows that large lines, geoformolophy, and climate belts in eastern South America are similar to those on the southwest coast of Africa. He also argued that fossils of plants and animals appeared on both continents and that when they were alive, these organisms might not have crossed the width of the South Atlantic which is currently separating both continents. So logic states that South America and Africa were once part of the same land. Wegener concluded that South America and Africa (also others) were connected to each other, perhaps through a land bridge, some 250 million years ago. He also believed that Pangea had been almost throughout the history of the Earth. Wegener relied on the work of Austrian geologist Eduard Sues, who (though he was a great supporter of the drowning continents) first developed the concept of Gondwanaland \u25aa a Supercontinent that survived from 600 to 180 million years ago and is composed of today's Africa, South America, Australia, India, and Antarctica. Suess sees rock formations in India that compare well in terms of age and composition with similar formations in different southern continents. Wegener used the Suess work to support the hypothesis of the continent's own shift and consider Gondwanaland as the southern part of Pangea. Despite this geological and peleontological evidence, the theory of the shifting of the Wegener continent is not accepted by the scientific community, because its explanation of the driving force behind the continent's movement (which is said to be derived from a force of attraction that shows the Earth's equivalnal ridge or gravitational pull of the...

For example, benzene is reduced to syclohexes with platinum catalysts: In organic chemistry, a good reductor is a factor that historically produces H.

In the 3rd century B.C.E. geometry was put into the form of an aximate by Euclid, which was assisted by Euclid geometry, to be standard for centuries. Archimedes developed a clever technique to calculate broadness and content, in many ways anticipating modern integral calculus. The field of astronomy, mainly mapping the positions of stars and planets on the frigate and describing the relationship between the celestial movement, served as an important source of geometric problems over the next one and a half millennium. Both geometry and astronomy are considered in the classical world to be part of the Quadrivium, the subset of the seven liberal arts considered essential for free citizens to rule. Coordinate recognition by Ren\u00e9 Descartes and the joint development of algebra marked a new stage for geometry, because geometric figures, like the curve of analytical curves, could now be represented by function and equations. This played an important role in the emergence of calculus in the 17th century. Next, perspective theory shows that there is more geometry than metric properties of numbers: perspective is the origin of projective geometry. Subsequent geometry subjects were enriched by the study of intrinsic structures of geometric objects that originated with Euler and Gauss and led to the creation of topology and differential geometry.

Whereas the visual properties of geometry originally made it more accessible than any other part of mathematics, such as algebra or number theory, geometric languages were also used in a context far from traditional, the origin of the Euclidean (for example, in its fractal geometry and algebra). Early records of geometry can be traced back to ancient Egypt, the Indus and Babylonian Valley civilization. These civilizations are known to have expertise in swamp drains, irrigation, flood control and the establishment of great buildings. Most Egyptian geometry of ancient and Babylonian is limited only to long calculations of lines, broads, and volumes.

Scheele produced chlorine by acting MnO2, with HCl: Scheele observed some chlorine properties: bleaching effect on lakmus, deadly on insects, yellow-green color, and smells similar to aqua regia. At the time, he hadn't managed to create the chlorine as its own element.",

Berylliums are alkaline earth metals, whose main uses are aids in aloys (specially, beryllium copper). Beryllium has the highest melting point in light metals. The modulus of beliumity is about 1/3 larger than steel. Berilium has excellent heat conductivity, impervious and rust-resistant nitrate acid. Beryllium is also easily exposed to X-rays, and neutrons are released when they are hit by alpha particles, (such as radium and polonium are approximately 30 neutrons-neutrons/MMths of alpha particles). At temperature and pressure of space, beryllium is unoxidated when exposed to air (his ability to scratch glass may be caused by the formation of thin layers of oxidation). The name beryllium comes from the Greek word beryllos, beryll. Beryllium was once called glucinium (from Greek glykys, sweets), because of its sweet taste of salt. This element was discovered by Louis Vauquelin in 1798 in the form of oxide in bells and in emeralds. Friedrich W\u00f6hler and A. A. Bussy each managed to isolate metal in 1828 by retaliating potassium with beryllium chloride. Berilium has only one stable isotope, Be-9. The cosmogenic beryllium (Be-10) is generated in the atmosphere through the shooting of oxygen and nitrogen by cosmic rays. Because berylliums often form in solution at a rate less than 5.5 (and most rainwater has pH than 5), beryllium will dissolve into the solution and be carried to the surface of the Earth by rain. When it's faster than ever before, berllium comes out of the solution. Be-10 cosmogenics will be collected on the surface of the ground, where it has a long beak time (1.5 million years) which allows it to stay long enough before it collapses into a B-10 (boron).",

Further, the level of nuclear power bellium 8 shows that carbon daat is produced in the stars, so sehingka is possible for the existence of life. (See the process of tripel-alfa and nucleosinthesis big bang) Berilium and its salt are toxic and potentially carcinogenic. Cronic dialysis is a pulmonary and systemic granulomatus disease caused by exposure to beryllium. Acute beryllium disease in the form of chemical pneumonitis was first reported in Europe in 1933 and in the United States in 1943. The case of chronic dialysis was first specified in 1946 among workers in the calymantang lamp supply. It's corroborative, it's sarcoidisic-like in many ways, and the diagnosis of distinguishment is difficult. Although the use of beryllium mixtures in the floresesins lights had been stopped in 1949, the possible exposure of belliums could still be occurring in the nuclear industry, the flight, the purified metals of beryllium, the dispersal of Alloys, the manufacture of electronic devices and management of the material that contained the volume. Early testers tasted berylliums and other mixtures for sweetness to ensure his presence. A sophisticated testing tool no longer requires these high - risk procedures and attempts to eat this material are inappropriate.

This new thought concerns the fields of art, architecture, politics, science, and literature. The first examples are the development of perspective in oil painting and the reanimation of the intelligence of concrete. Even if the discovery of metal loose letters accelerated the dispersion of ideas since the end of the 15th century, Renaissance changes have not been uniform throughout Europe.

The person who developed it was Viktor Frankl. The main purpose of logotherapy is to acquire the belief that life is something meaningful. Frankl's idea of logotherapy is also a direct result of his experience. Frankl suffered great suffering during World War II when he was a prisoner of war in a German concentration camp. During his concentration camp, Frankl along with other prisoners of war suffered torture and terror. He also saw the violent murders committed against prisoners of war. In those circumstances, Frankl tried to ease the suffering of the prisoners of war by telling them about the meaning of life despite suffering. Frankl then observed the prisoners of war and concluded that prisoners of war who had hope of freedom had more courage than any other prisoner. From his observations, Frankl learned about the meaning of life, especially suffering. The term logotherapy was taken by Frankl from the Greek root word Logos. The word means meaning. The idea of logotherapy also begins with Frankl's rejection of the idea of Sigund Freud. Freud claims that the spiritual dimension that humans have is the result of sublimation of animal instincts. The idea of stoning was then presented by Frankl as a form of rejection. He believes that psychic processes are not the only factor that affects human behavior.

For the most part, entertainment can be either video games, music, movies, operas, dramas, or even sports games. Touring can also be said to be an attempt at entertainment either by exploring nature or by studying culture. Filling such leisure activities as craftmaking, skill, reading can also be categorized as entertainment for certain people with workaholic properties, work is entertainment compared with silence. In addition, there are places for entertainment or nightclubs (nightclub) as places to relieve fatigue, mainly from restaurants or restaurants that are equipped with hotels as well as means of entertainment such as music, karaoke, and opera. Others provide games such as pools to the point of gambling. For some, gambling is considered to be a pastime or a means of evaporation. Besides, in some countries there are also nightclubs devoted to family meetings that are certainly different from regular nightclubs. Entertainment often brings pleasure, pleasure, and laughter. In a certain time or context, there are also serious additional goals. For example, various forms of celebration, religious festivals, or satire. According to the Great English Dictionary (KBI), \"Survival\" comes from the word \"Comfort\" v, /hi\u00b7bur/ or \"Comfort\" / meng\u00b7hi\u00b7bur/ v, fun and reassuring. This means that entertainment can be understood as something or an act that can be comforted (for forgetting grief and so forth). Oxford's English dictionary gave him Latin and French origins for the word \"Entertainment,\" including inter (between) + tenir (to hold) as a deviation, giving a translation of \"holding together\" or \"holding intertwined\" and \"to engage, to keep occupied, mind or time.\"",

Many entertainments, including storytelling but especially music and drama, have remained close but have developed into various forms that fit personal preference and vast cultural expressions. Many types are mixed or supported by other forms. For example, dramas, stories, and banquets (or dinners) are usually improved by music; sports and games are included in other activities to enhance attraction.

Democritos developed the thought of atoms that led to the more well - known Democritos thought in the history of philosophy. Besides being a philosopher, Democritos is also known for mastering many skills. Unfortunately, Democritos' work is not stored. Democritos wrote about science, astronomy, mathematics, literature, epistemology, and ethics. There are about 300 quotes of Democritos' thinking inside ancient sources. Most of those quotes are about ethics. Democritos was born in the city of Abdera, North Greece. He lived about 460 B.C.E. to 370 B.C.E. He came from a wealthy family. When he was young, he used his inheritance to travel to Egypt and other Eastern lands. Besides becoming Leukippos' disciples, he also studied with Anaxagoras and Philolaos. There's little to be known about Democritos' history. A lot of data about his life has been mixed up with legends whose truth is hard to believe. Although he was a contemporary of Socrates, even younger, Democritos was still classified as a pre-socratic philosopher. This is because he went on and developed the teaching of atomicism of Leukippos which is a pre-socratic philosopher. The teachings of Leukippos and Democritos can hardly be separated. Moreover, Democritos philosophy was not known in Athens for long. For example, Plato knew nothing about Atomism. Aristotle then took great note of the view of atomicism. Democritos and his teacher, Leukippos, argue that atoms are the elements that make up reality. Here, they agree with the teaching of Empedocles pluralism and Anaxagoras that reality consists of many elements, not one. However, contrary to Empedocles and Anaxagoras, Democritos thought that these elements could no longer be divided.",

The atoms differ from the others through three things: they're like letter A different than N), they're in sequence (like An is different from NA), and they're positioned (A is different from Z in alphabetical order). Thus, atoms have sheer quantity, including mass. The number of atoms that make up this reality is endless. Furthermore, atoms are also viewed as unmade, indestructible, and unchanging. What happens to atoms is motion. Therefore, Democritus stated that \"the fundamental principles of the universe are atoms and voids.\" If there's empty space, then those atoms can move. Democritus compared atomic motion to a situation when sunlight entered a pitch-dark room through the cracks of a window. It'll show how the dust moves through all the directions, even though there's no wind to cause it to move. Thus, it doesn't take any other principle to make the atoms move, like the principles of \"love\" and \"hate\" according to Empedocles. There's enough empty space to make those atoms move. The world and all of reality are created because different atoms are intertwined with each other. The related atoms then start to move around, and the longer the more atoms are involved in that movement. The larger atoms live in the center of the motion, while the finer pieces of atoms are shot to the tip.",

In the middle of the river, the Parasara Resi is enthralled by Satyawati's beauty. Satyawati then chatted with Resi Parasara, telling her that she had a disease that caused her body to stink. Satyawati's father says that any man who can cure his illness can be a husband. Hearing that, Resi Parasara said that he was willing to cure Satyawati's disease. Because of his ability as a resi, the parasaras cured Satyawati in an instant. After the proposal was approved by Satyawati's parents, the Parasara and Satyawati were married. The bride and groom enjoyed their first night on an island in the middle of the Yamuna River, said to be located near the city of Kalpi in the Jalaun district of Uttar Pradesh, India. There the Parasara Resi created a thick, dark mist so that the island could not be seen. The result of his relationship was the birth of a very remarkable child.

Since the two princes died without offspring, Satyawati summoned Beyasa to carry on a sacred ceremony to obtain offspring. The two widows of Wicitrawirya, Amyaka and Amyaka, were asked to face Fey alone to perform. In accordance with the rules of the ceremony, first Ambika faces Fey. Because he was afraid to see the face of his mastery, he turned a blind eye. Because Ambika closed her eyes during the ceremony, he said that her son would be born blind. Then Amreturna faces Kaysa.

Purchase of goods is only based on desire and not considering needs. At first, consumer protection was a consumer protection movement. As materialism philosophy and positivism developed, consumerism developed into a consumption of wasteful modern technology. Consumerism formed through the construction of entertainment centers and shopping centers in major cities. The main cause of consumerism has been greater fulfillment of desire than its fulfilment of needs. Humans have unlimited desires and limited abilities. This keeps humans from fulfilling their desires despite their limited ability to fulfill them. This behavior prevents humans from ever attaining satisfaction so that consumerism occurs naturally. The concept of consumerism began to be gassed by Walt Whitman Rostow through the idea that excessive consumption would arise in the final stages of economic growth. People's desires and interests tend to put consumption and well - being first through available resources along with political support. Consumerism's behavior spread through the conquest of other countries and the domination of them. At this stage consumerism only puts primary needs first. After that consumerism was used as a means to create a prosperous country. At this stage it's applied to tax systems that will share the average prosperity in society. Consumerism is still considered a consumption movement during the 1890-1906 period. In the 1930s period, the growing desire of society to do massive consumption made consumerism viewed as a mass waste activity.

Initially, archea was classified as a bacteria and was named after archaeacteria (in Archaebacteria kingdom), but this classification was no longer used. Archea cells have a unique trait that separates archea from two other domains of life, Bacteria and Eukaryota. The Arkea is divided into several filums. The classification is difficult because the majority of the archea has not been isolated in the lab and only detected the gene sequence from samples taken from the environment. Arkea and bacteria generally have similar sizes and shapes, although some archea have very strange shapes, such as flat, rectangular cells like Haloquadratum walsbyi. Although there are morphological similarities between archea and bacteria, archea has genes and several metabolic pathways that are more similar to eukaryota, especially enzymes involved in transcription and translatation. One aspect of the archea biochemical unique is the dependency of the archeatic lipid ether on their cell membranes. Arkea uses more energy than eukaryota, which ranges from such organic compounds as sugar, ammonia, metal ions, or even hydrogen gas.

They are part of microbiota for all organisms. As a human microbiota, archeatics play an important role in the colon, oral cavity, and skin. Morphological, metabolic, and geographical diversity allows them to have a broad ecological role, such as in carbon fixation in the carbon cycle, a role in the nitrogen cycle, the rotation of organic compounds, and the preservation of symbiotic communities and microbial synths. No clear example has been found for pathogenic or parasitic archea. On the other hand, archea is often a qualityist or a commensurate, such as a methane that lives in human digestive tracts and ruminansia, where they live in large quantities and helps the digestive. Metanogens are used in biogas production and waste processing. Meanwhile, enzymes from extremists that can survive high temperatures and organic solvents are used in biotechnology. In most of the 20th century, procariota was considered a group of organisms and was classified based on their biochemical, morphological properties, and metabolism. Microbiologists try to classify microorganisms based on the structure of cell walls, shapes, and substances they consume. In 1965 Linus Pauling and Emile Zuckerkandl proposed using gene sequences in various procaritas to identify their relationship with one another. This approach, known as phylogenetics, is the primary method used today.

The presence of deoxyribonucleic acid is found inside the nucleus of the cell. James Dewey Watson and Francis Crick were the first scientists to propose a model of DNA structure in 1953 with a double pill. Each DNA is composed of two polynukleotide chains. DNA is a kind of biomolecular that stores and encodes the genetic instructions of every organism and many types of viruses. These genetic instructions play an important role in growth, development, and function of organisms and viruses. DNA is a nucleic acid; along with proteins and carbohydrates, nucleic acids are essential macromolecular for all known living things. Most DNA molecules are made up of two biopolymer editing coils that form double helixes. These two edits are known as polynukleotides because they're both made up of a bunch of molecules called nucleotides. Each nucleotide consists of one type of nitrogen base (G), adenina (A), timina (T), or cytosina (C), a monosocaride called deoxyribose, and a phosphate group. These nucleotides are then connected in one covalent bond between sugar one nucleotide with the other phosphate nukelotide. The result is the alternating back chain of sugar-phosphate. According to the code of base pairs (A with T and C with G), the hydrogen bond binds the bases of the two polynucleotide edits form the DNA double edits of two anti-parallel DNA, which means that they pair up in opposite ways. In each sugar group, it's bound to one of four types of nucleobasa. This sequence of nucleic acids four nucleobasa along the back chain of DNA holds the biological information code.

Therefore, this biological information will be replicated when two D.N.A. edits are separated. Most of the DNA (more than 98% in humans) is non-coded, which means this part does not encrypt proteins. In the cell, DNA is composed in chromosomes. During cell division, these chromosomes were duplicated in a process called DNA replication. Eukaryotic organisms store most of their DNA in the nucleus of the cell and a fraction of the rest in organelles such as mitochondria or chloroplasts. Rather, procariotic organisms store their DNA only in cytoplasm. In chromosomes, chromatin proteins such as histons play a role in compiling DNA into compact structures. It's this compact structure that then interacts between DNA and other proteins, so it helps control which parts of DNA can be described. Scientists use DNA as a molecular tool to expose theories and laws of physics, such as ergodic theorems and elasticity theory. The distinctive properties of DNA matter make it very interesting to study for scientists and engineers who work in microfactory and nanofactory materials. Some of the advances in this material include origami DNA and hybrid materials based on DNA. DNA is a polymer made up of repeated units called nucleotides.

The formula is distilled by clear - colored liquids, and it is usually stored in a barrel made of oak or other wood. The largest rum producers in the world are Caribbean countries and along the Demerara River in Guyana, South America. Moreover, rum factories exist in other countries of the world like Australia, India, the Reunion Islands. Rum consists of a variety of different levels of alcohol. The white rum is commonly used as a cocktail mixer. The rum is golden and dark brown, used for cooking, baking, and also for mixing cocktails. Only high-quality rum is commonly taken innocently without mixing or adding ice cubes (on the rocks). Rum played an important role in the culture of people in the West Indies, and was known as pirate drink and British Royal Navy. The origin of the word rum is unknown. A lot of opinions say the origin of the word is rumbullion which means \"great noise or straggler.\" Another opinion says rum was taken from a large glass for drinking Dutch people called rummers, from the word roemer or drinking glasses. Another possibility is that rum is another short for saccharum (Latin for sugar), or ar\u00f4me (French for aroma). In the United States, the term \"rumme\" has been commonly used since May 1657. At that time, the Massachusetts Commonwealth Congress (General Court of Massachusetts) banned the sale of high alcoholic liquor \"no matter its name rumme, strong water', wine, brandy, etc.\" Today, rum is often referred to by the local name where rum is produced.",

Caffeinated foods are found naturally in such foods as coffee beans, tea leaves, cola, guarana, and mat\u00e9. In plants, it acts as a natural pesticide that cripples and kills certain insects that eat them. He is generally consumed by humans by extracting them from coffee beans and tea leaves. Caffeine is a stimulant of the central nervous system in humans and can exorcise temporary drowsiness. Drinks containing caffeine, such as coffee, tea, and soft drinks, are very popular. Caffeine is the most consumed psychoactive substance in the world. Unlike other psychoactive substances, caffeine is legal and is not regulated by law in most of the world's jurisdictions.

The world's main source of caffeine is coffee beans. The caffeine content of coffee varies, depending on the type of coffee beans and the method of manufacture used. In general, one coffee dish contains about 40 mg (30 mL espresso varieties of arabica) caffeine, up to 100 mg caffeine for one cup (120 mL) of coffee. Generally, dark-roast coffee has lower caffeine levels because roasting reduces caffeine content in the seeds. Coffee varieties of arabica generally contain fewer levels of caffeine than the coffee of the robusta variety. Coffee also contains a small amount of teophilina, but it does not contain teobromina. Tea is another source of caffeine. Although tea contains higher levels of caffeine than coffee, tea is generally served in much lower levels of serving. Caffeinated content also vary in different types of tea leaves. Tea contains a small amount of teobromina and a slightly higher levels of teophilina than coffee.

The primary purpose of this mission's launch is to study Jupiter and Saturn, but those two aircraft are able to continue their journey to the outer solar system. They're currently on their way out of the solar system. They were built on JPL and funded by NASA. Voyager 1 is now a man-made object far away from Earth. From this mission, it was successfully collected data regarding gas giants in the solar system, previously unknown. Two Voyager space vehicles were originally compiled as part of Mariner's program, and therefore they were at first named Mariner 11 and Mariner 12. They were then transferred to a separate program called \"Mariner Jupiter-Saturn\", which was then named Voyager Program because it was thought that the design of two space vehicles had developed far enough outside the Mariner family to get a separate name. Voyager's program is similar to the Planetary Grand Tour planned in the late 1960s and early '70s. The Grand Tour will take advantage of the alignment of the outer planets discovered by Gary Flandro, an aerospace engineer at Jet Propulsion Laboratory. This alignment, which occurs every 175 years, will occur in the late 1970s and allow it to use gravity aid to explore Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto.

Voyager 1 launched after Voyager 2, but along the shorter and faster trajectory it was designed to give the optimal flight of the moon Saturn Titan, which is known to be large enough and has a dense atmosphere. This meeting sent Voyager 1 out of the ecliptic field, ending its planetary science mission.

Voyager 1 was not launched on a track that allowed it to continue to Uranus and Neptune, but it could continue from Saturn to Pluto without exploring Titan.

FET has sometimes been referred to as an econcussive transistor to distinguish a single load-carrying operation performed by a two-carrying operation on the dwikub transistor (BJT). The transistor of the effect of the Tirzahmedan was created by Julius Edgar Lilenfeld in 1925 and by Oskar Heil in 1934, but the practical device was not made en masse until the 1990s. All FETs have a gateway, a cerat and a source that is roughly the same as the base, collector and emitter at BJT. Besides JFET, all FETs also have a fourth channel called body, base or substrate. This fourth channel serves a technical use in transistor containment into its operating point. This terminal is rarely used in circuit design, but its existence is essential when designing integrated circuitry. The channel names on FET refer to their function. The gateway can be considered an open-and-shut control of a real gate. This gate allows electrons to flow or prevent them by creating and binding a canal between the source and the cerat. Electrons flow from source to cerat channel if any voltage is given. The body is an entire base semiconductor where gates, sources and cerats are placed. It's usually connected to the highest voltage or lowest circuitry, depending on the type. Source channels and channels are usually connected because sources are usually connected to the highest or lowest voltage of the circuits, but there are some uses from FETs that are unlike these, such as transmission and cascade gate circuits.

FET controls the electron stream (or electron holes on FET channels) of the source to the cerat by converting large and form of a conductive channel formed by voltage (or lack of voltage on FET channels) which are worn across the gates and sources (in order to facilitate the dispersion, assuming that the body and the source are connected). This conductive channel is a path where electrons (or holes) flow from source to cerat. By assuming a channel-n mode of skinning. A negative voltage gate-to-source causes a poor area to expand and block canals from both sides, narrowing the conductive channel. If the skinning area shuts down the canal completely, the resistant channels from source to cerat become large, and the FET is turned off like an open switch. Instead, a positive voltage of the gate-to-source adds the width of the canal and allows the electron to flow easily. Now consider a channel-n mode of enrichment. A positive voltage gate-to-source is required to create conductive canals because it doesn't exist naturally inside the transistor. Positive tension attracts free electrons on the body to the gate, making a conductive channel. But enough electrons have to be drawn close to the gate to fight the doping ions added to the FET body, this forms a moving-free area called the skinning area, and this phenomenon is called the impervious voltage of the FET. The increased voltage of the gates to the cerat, this process is called reversing. Either in the mode of the plugin or in poorness, if the voltage-to-source is much lower than the voltage of the gates, changing the voltage will change the resistant of the canals, and the current will be comparable to the voltage of the sources.",

Because of this quality, topology is also called rubber geometry. It emerges through the development of concepts of geometry and theory of assembly, such as space, dimensions, shapes, and transformations. The idea now classified into topology has been expressed since 1736, and by the end of the 19th century a clearly separate science was developed. This science is referred to in Latin as the site's geometry (\"geometry of place\") or website analysis (Greek-Latin for \"testing place\"), and then it gets the name of the latest topology. In the middle of the 20th century, topology has become one of the major branches of mathematics. The word topology is used both for the math branch and for the family assembly with some qualities used to determine the topology chamber, the basic object of the topology. Some of the important things are homeomorphisms that can be defined as malfunction with a malarical reverse. For example, the y function = 3x is homeomorphism from the real number line to itself. Topology covers many subverses. The most fundamental and traditional part of the topology is: Some of the most active fields, such as low-dimensional topology and graphic theory, don't fit nicely in this division. The motivating insight behind the topology is that some geometrical problems do not depend on the exact shape of the objects involved, but on the way they are put together. For example, squares and circles have many similar properties: they are one-dimensional objects (from a topological point of view) and both separate fields into two sections, inside and outside.",

These results do not depend on the length of bridges or distances from each other, but only on connectivity properties: which bridge connects to the island or to which bank. The problem with these Seven K\u00f6nigsberg Bridges led to a mathematical branch known as graph theory. Similarly, the hairy-ball theorem of algebra topology says that \"one can't brush hair all the way to a hairy ball without making a hair lick.\" This fact is immediate convincing to most people, although they may not recognize a more formal theorem statement, that no vector field mentions continu does not disappear on the ball. As with the K\u00f6nigsberg Bridge, the result does not depend on the shape of the ball; it applies to all kinds of fine blobs, as long as there are no holes. To deal with this problem that doesn't depend on the exact shape of the object, we need to be clear about what properties are relied upon by this matter do. Here comes homeosfier's understanding. The improbability to cross each bridge only once applies to any form of homeomorphic bridge with that in K\u00f6nigsberg, and the hairball theorem applies to any space that is homeomorphic for a sphere. Intuitively, two spaces are homeomorphic if one can transform into another without cutting or binding.

The quantity of \"1 ppm\" can be used for mass fractions if water - carried pollutants are found in a millionth of a gram per gram of sample solution. When dealing with water solution, it's usually assumed that the mass of water is 1.000 g/mL. It is therefore common to compare 1 kilogram [1 kg] of water to 1 L of water. As a result, 1 ppm corresponds to 1 mg/L and 1 ppb according to 1 g/L. Similarly, section per notation is also used in physics and techniques to express the value of proportional phenomena. For example, special metal alloys can expand 1.2 micrometers per meter long for every degree Celsius and this will be described as \"1.2 ppm/\u00b0C.\" Parts per notation is also used to indicate change, stability, or uncertainty in measurements. For example, the accuracy of surveying distances when using laser distance gauges may be one millimeter per kilometer per kilometer; this can be described as \"accuracy = 1 ppm.\" Part per notation is all nondimensional quantity: in mathematical expression, unit measurements always cancel.",

When part notation per, including the percent symbol (%), is used in regular prose (as opposed to mathematical expression), they are still pure nondimensional quantity of numbers. However, they generally take the literal meaning of the \"part by\" of the comparative ratio (e.g. \"2 ppb\" will generally be interpreted as \"two parts in a billion parts\"). Section per notation can be specified in the same size unit. For example, the expansion coefficient of certain brass alloys, \u25aa = 18.7 ppm/\u00b0C, can be expressed as 18.7, or as 18.7, the numeric value that represents relative proportions do not change with the application of different long units. Similarly, measuring pumps that inject chemicals into the main process line at the rate of the Qp proportional flow = 125 ppm, do it at a rate that can be expressed in various volumetric units, including 125 \u25aaL/L, 125 gal/gal, 125 cm3/m3, etc. In the spectroscopy of the magnetic resonance of the nucleus (nuclear magnetic resonance, NMR), chemical shift is usually expressed in the ppm. It represents a frequency difference measured in parts per million of the reference frequency. The frequency of reference depends on the magnetic field of instruments and measured elements. It's usually in MHz. Typical chemical shift is rarely more than a few hundred Hz from reference frequencies, so chemical shift is easily expressed in ppm (Hz/MHz). Parts notation per gives a nirdimensional quantity that doesn't depend on the force of the instrument field. Although the International Bureau for Size and Scales (an international standard organization also known as its French initial, BIPM) acknowledges the use of section per notation, this is not officially part of the International Unit system (SI).",

The type of structure consists of hierarchy (a single-to-many link), a network that shows many-to-many links, or grids that display connections between adjacent components in space. Buildings, airplanes, skeletons, anthills, beaver dams, and salt domes are examples of load-resistant structures. Construction results are divided into buildings and non-construction structures, and they form infrastructure for society. The structure that is built widely is divided by various approaches and standards of design, which is into the category of structure, architecture, civil engineering, and mechanical structure. The weight effect on the physical structure is determined through structural analysis, which is one of the tasks of structural techniques. Structural elements can be classified as one dimension (ropes, buffers, beams, curves), two dimensions (membrancing, plates, plates, shells, domes), or three dimensions (mass solid). The last two elements (three dimensions) were the primary options available for early structures like Chichen Itza. In this analysis, the element of one dimension has a much larger dimension than any other element, so that other dimensions can be ignored in calculations; however, the smaller ratio of dimensions and compositions can determine the rigidity and force of the elements.

For example, the derivative of the position of an object moves to time measuring the speed of objects when time moves. The derivative is an important tool in calculus. The derivative of a single variable function at a point, if it exists, is the slope of the line referenced to the graph of the function at that point. The linear link is the best closeness of the function around that point. Derived concepts can be publicized for multivariable functions. In this discussion, derivatives are considered to be linear transformations, with a corresponding translation, resulting in almost linear approaches of the multivariable function graph. The Jacobi matrix is a matrix that represents linear transformation to a specified base. This matrix can be determined by the partial derivative of independent variables. At a multivariable function of real value, the Jacobi matrix is reduced to a gradient vector. The process of finding derivatives is called differentiation. The reverse process is called antibreeding. The fundamental theory of calculus states that relationships differ with integration. Derived and integral are two basic operations in one-variable calculus. The concept of a universal derivative of function is widely used in various branches of mathematics and other fields of science. In economics, derivatives are used to calculate marginal costs, total acceptance, and production costs. Biological fields use derivatives to calculate the growth rate of microorganisms, in physics to calculate wire density, in chemistry to calculate the rate of separation, in geography to calculate population growth rates, and many more. Informally, the derivative of a y-function with variable x is the size of the change rate of y value to change value x.

        "paragraph": "Butana is an organic compound with a C4H10 formula which is an alcana with four carbon atoms. Butane is a gaseous form at the temperature of space and atmospheric pressure. This term can refer to one of two structural isomers, n-butana or isobutana (also called \"methylpropana\"), or the mixture of this isomer-isomer. But in the IUPAC nomenclature, \"butane\" refers only to a n-butana isomer (which is an unpronged structure). Butana is a highly flammable gas, colorless, easily melted, which evaporates rapidly at room temperature. The name butane comes from root but- (from grainic acid, named after the Greek word for butter) and -ana. Butana was discovered by chemist Edward Frankland in 1849. It was found dissolved in crude oil in 1864 by Edmund Ronalds, who was the first person to describe its properties. Rotation skeletal molecules around the C\u25aaC bond produce two different n-butana conformations (trans and gauche). When oxygen is abundant, butane burns form carbon dioxide and water vapor; when oxygen is limited, carbon or carbon monoxide can also form. Butana is denser than air. When oxygen is sufficient: When oxygen is limited: Anibatic temperature is maximum butane with air is 2,253 K (1,970 \u00b0C; 3,578 \u00b0F). n-Butana is the raw material for the duPont catalyst process in the manufacture of a maleat anhydrida: n-Butana, like all hydrocarbons, is experiencing a free radical chrion that produces both 1-kloro- and 2-klorobutan, and its higher derivative. The relative rate of chlorination is partly explained by energy associated with different bonds, 425 and 411 kJ/mol for two types of C\u25aaH bonds. Norbal butane can be used as a mixture of gasoline, an extraction solvent of perfumes, both single and in a mixture of propane, and as a raw ingredient in ethylene and blindness, the primary components of synthetic rubber.",

The very pure form of butane, especially isobutana, can be used as refrigeration and has largely replaced halometana that damages the ozone layer, such as the refrigerator and the household freezer. The operating pressure of the system to butane is lower than for halometana, like R-12, so the R-12 system as in the autotive air conditioning system, when converted into pure butane will not function optimally and therefore used a mix of isobutana and propane to give the performance of the cooling system equivalent to R-12. Butana was also used as fuel for gas matches or butane torches and was sold in jars as cooking fuel, barbecues and camping stoves. The global market of the butane tube is dominated by South Korean producers. As fuel, it is often mixed with a small amount of hydrogen sulfide and brandished so that nonburned gases become pungent and easily detected by the human nose. In this way, a leak of butane can easily be identified. Most commercially circulated butanes also contain a certain amount of contaminating oil that can be removed through filtering but will instead leave deposits at the point of ignition that can block the flow of gas. If inhaled, butane can cause euphoria, drowsiness, faintness, asphyxia, heart arithmetic, blood pressure fluctuation and a moment of memory loss.",

Yet only Pitcairn Island is inhabited. Pitcairn is one of the least-biased countries that have citizens. Pitcairn islanders were the crews involved in the event at Dhagi on HMS Bounty, as well as the Tahitins who were brought along by the refugees, as related in the Mutiny on the Bounty novels, which became the theme of some films. The history of this Pitcairn island is clearly seen in the names of the family of its residents who are descended from the crew of the HMS Bounty. Early settlers in the Pitcairn Islands were Polynesians who had apparently lived in P. Pitcairn and P. Henderson, and P. Mangareva (250 miles) northwest, for several centuries. They trade goods for each other to form a social bond between the three islands. The social bonds intertwined through the canoe voyages help small populations on every island to survive in limited resources. When important natural resources were reduced, trade between the islands was interrupted and civil war in P. Mangareva, which caused the human population in Henderson and Pitcairn to cease to exist. Although some archaeologists believed that Polynesians lived in Pitcairn until the end of the 15th century, the islands were uninhabited when they were rediscovered by Europeans.

Pitcairn. Pitcairn Island was spotted on July 3, 1767 by British crew HMS Swallow, under the command of Captain Philip Carteret. The island was named after Cadet Robert Pitcairn, one of the fifteen - year - old sailors who was the first to see the island. Robert Pitcairn was the son of British Navy Major John Pitcairn, who later died at the Battle of Bunker Hill in the American Revolution. Carteret, who sailed without a marine chronometer at the time just surfaced, mapped Pitcairn Island at 25 \u00b0 2'S 133 \u00b0 21'W. Although the latitude estimates are accurate, the longitude estimates are approximately 3 \u00b0 (330 km). This made it difficult for Pitcairn to find, such as the failure of Captain James Cook to find the island in July 1773. In 1790 nine of the crew of Dhagi perpetrators aboard the Bounty, along with the native Tahitins (six men, eleven women and a baby girl), settled in the Pitcairn Islands and burned the Bounty. The remains of the event are still visible underwater in Bounty Bay, which was discovered in 1957 by Explorer National Geographic Marden.

The liver is also an excretion tool because it helps a kidney function by breaking up some toxic compounds and producing ammonia, urea, and gout by taking advantage of nitrogen from amino acids. The process of solving toxic compounds by the liver is called the detoxification process. The liver lobe is made up of parenkimal cells as well as non-parenkimal cells. Heart parentimal cells are called hepatocytes, occupying about 80% of the volume of the liver and performing major functions of the liver. 40% of the liver cells are found in the sinusoidal lobe. Hepatosit is an endodermal cell that is stimulated by mesenkimal tissue constantly at the time of embryos to develop into parentimal cells. During that time, there was an increase in the transcription of mRNA albumin as a proliferation stimulant and differentiation of endodermal cells to hepatocytes. The lumen lobes are formed from the SEC and are occupied by three other types of cells, such as the Kupffer cells, the Ito cells, the lymphocytes of intrahepatics like pit cells. Non-parenkimal cells occupy about 6.5% volume of the liver and produce various substances that control many hepatocyte functions. The filtration is one function of lumen-lobus sinusoidal which separates part of the surface of the hepatocyte from the blood, the SEC has a huge capacity of endocytosis with lots of ligatures like glycoprotein, immune complex, transferin and cryoplasmin. \"SEC\" also serves as an antigen presenter cell that provides MHC I and MHC II expressions for T.

A daily Kupffer cell interacts with material that comes from an digestive tract containing a bacterial solution, and prevents activation of the effect of the compound toxin into the liver. A high strain of bacterial solution, especially LPS exposure, causes the Kupffer cells to secretion of various cytoxins that trigger the inflammatory process and can lead to injury to the liver. Secretions include reactive oxygen species, eikosanoids, nitrogen monoxide, carbon monoxide, TNF-\u25aa, IL-10, in response to the innate immune system in the primary infection phase. pit cells are lymphocytes with large granulas, such as NK cells that reside in the heart. pit cells can induce instant death in tumor cells without depending on antigen expressions on the major histompathy complex. pit cell activity can be enhanced by interferon-stimulated stimulation.

In the atmosphere, methanol is light, volatile, colorless, and toxic with distinctive odors (smells lighter than ethanol). Methanol is used as a coolant, a solvent, a fuel, and as an additive material for industrial ethanol. Methanol is produced naturally by anaerobic metabolism by bacteria. The result of that process is methanol vapor in the air. After a few days, the methanol vapor will be oxidized by oxygen with the help of sunlight into carbon dioxide and water. Methanol chemical reactions that burn in the air and form carbon dioxide and water are the following: Because of its toxic nature, methanols are often used as additives for making alcohol for industrial use. Adding this \"poison\" will prevent industry from being charged because ethanol is the main ingredient for booze. Methanol is sometimes also referred to as alcohol wood because it used to be a by - product of wood distillation. Today methanol is generated through a multiphant process. In short, natural gas and water vapor were burned in the furnace to form hydrogen gas and carbon monoxide; then, the hydrogen gas and carbon monoxide reacted in high pressure with the help of the catalyst to produce methanol. The formation stage is endothermic and the synthesis stage is exothermic. In the process of preserving corpses, the ancient Egyptians used a variety of mixtures, including methanol, which they obtained from wood piralysis.

Sense is made an absolute tool in knowing everything. In the terminology of rationalism, everything irrational must be nullified from knowledge.

THE nature of knowledge gained through rationalism is apriori. The rationalistic thinking system is plagued by axioms that claim that ideas are clear, firm and must be in the human mind. Humans don't create the ability for the mind to know the existence of ideas. In rationalism, knowledge does not come from human experience and experience.

Most geologists describe the peagmattic as the rough - winded frozen rock of the granite texture. Early in the use of the word pegmatit was used by Rene Hauy, a French mineralogi expert, as a graphical granite synonym. Graphic Granite has a mineral signature that shapes the shape of writing. In modern utilization, the plutonic frozen rock, almost entirely composed of crystals, has a diameter of at least an inch [one cm] in diameter. It's a special description of the pegmatit to make it easier to identify the shape. And it needs to be noticed when the term pegmatit has nothing to do with the mineral composition of a rock. Large - size crystals inside frozen rock often relate to the slow rate of crystallization. But the special terminology of the pegmatit, the formation of large crystals is bound by liquids that have low viscosity so that it allows ions in them to become free. During the initial crystallization of the magma, it is very common to see volatile melting (chlorine, fluor, CO2) and dissolved water.

The process of Peter's formation illustrates why the crystals are so large. Pegmatitic magma has a low viscosity, which allows for mineral movement in the fluid. Even though diffusivity is high, but the rate of nuclei is low, it's what causes small crystals to form. Melted water content, carbon dioxide and fluoric fluorescents can easily cause evaporation to occur. With high steam pressure and water mobility, this makes it possible for the melting that decantizes the soluted ions. So when the water comes out, the ion will settle down and form a crystal. Lelehans generally contain lithium and high concentration borons, which are useful as flux elements to minimize the temperature required in the insulating process. High temperatures around rock and low thermal gradients allow for a slow crystallization process, causing larger crystals to form.

The important point is that the pegmatitist is the shape of an intrusive frozen rock that has a rough texture consisting of large interlocked crystals. There's no mineralogi that's decided to petatit, any type of plutonic rock can be a plegatit. The most common kind of petatit is made of granite. The granite - shaped Pegmatit usually has elements of feldpar, quartz and mica.",

        "paragraph": "Ears or ears are an organ capable of detecting/knowing sounds & play a lot of roles in the balance and position of the body. The eggs in the vertebrates have the same basis of fish to humans, with some variations in accord with function and species. Each vertebrate has one set of ears, another one lies symmetrical on the opposite side of the head, to keep the balance and localization of the sound. Sound is an energy form that moves through air, water, or other objects, in a wave. Although the ear detects sound, recognition and interpretation functions are performed in the brain and central nervous system. The range of sound is conveyed to the brain through a nerve that connects the ear and brain (nervus vestibuloklearis). Humans with normal ear condition are generally able to detect sounds at a frequency of between 20 and 20,000 Hertz. The ear consists of three parts: the outer ear, the middle ear, and the inner ear. The outside is the outermost part of the ear, the outer earlobes, the outer earlobes, and the outer ear canals. The outer ear includes earlobes or pinnas, Liang ears or meatus externus auditorius, and eardrums or timpani membranes. The earlobes function to help steer sound into the ear burrow and eventually head for the eardrum. The complex design of the outer ear serves to pick up sound and the most important part is the ear burrow. This channel is a result of the formation of cartilage coated with thin skin. In the canal are many glands that produce waxlike substances called cumin or ear dung. Just the part of the channel that produces a little cumin that has hair. At the end of the channel there are eardrums that pass sounds to the inner ear.",

In Western society, the ears that are too large and look asymmetrical will exacerbate appearances. The first surgery to address this was published in 1881. The middle ear is the air cavity behind the eardrum, which covers, 3 hearing bones (martils or malleus, runways or incus, and stirrs or stapes). The tip of the Eustachius channel is also in the middle ear that balances the air pressure on the outside ear with the middle ear. The sound vibration received by the eardrum will be delivered to the hearing bones. Each of these hearing bones will continue to transmit vibrations to the next bone. The miscellaneous bones that are the smallest bones in the body pass on vibrations to the cochlea or the snail house. In humans and other land animals, middle ears and hearing channels will be filled with air in normal circumstances. Unlike on the outside, the air on the middle ear has nothing to do with the air outside the body. Eustachius channel connects the central ear room to the back of the faring. In ordinary circumstances, the link between the Eustachius channel and the middle ear is closed and open at the moment of chewing and yawning. This explains why aircraft passengers feel temporary deaf when they take off. The deaf flavor is due to a difference in pressure between the air and the surrounding. The air pressure around it has dropped, while in the middle ear it is ground air pressure. It will cause eardrums to push out so that hearing becomes disturbed and causes pain. These differences can be overcome by chewing or yawning mechanisms. According to Gabriel Corfas, some people feel little hearing loss for different reasons. So it takes a diagnosis of the right pathogenesis and it's considered very important.",

Archeologists and stone processing industries use this word with different meanings from geologists. The first uses in a broader sense include two different types of minerals: gypsum and calcite types. Geologists define alabasters as just gypsum. Chemically, gypsum is calcium sulfate hydrate, while calcite is calcium carbonate. Both types of alabasters have similar properties. They're usually colorful, light-translucent, and soft rocky. Both have been used throughout history primarily to carve decorative artifacts. Alabaster types of calcite are also named \"marmer onyx,\" \"an Egyptian alabaster,\" and \"oriental alabaster\" and are geologically described as solid travertine or \"stalagmytic limestone rock marked by a creme and brown swirling pattern.\" \"Marmer onyx\" is a traditional name, but geologically inaccurate, because either onyx or marble has a different geological definition of the most broad definition of alabaster. In general, ancient alabasters were calcite in the Middle East, including Egypt and Mesopotamia, while alabasters were gypsum in medieval Europe. Modern alabaster is likely to be calcite but can be both. Both are easily processed and can somewhat dissolve in water. Both have been used to make various artworks and indoor carvings, and will not last long outdoors. Both types of alabasters are easily distinguished from their violent levels: alabaster gipsum is so soft that the nails will scratch it (the violence of Mohs 1.5 to 2), while the calcite cannot be scratched in this way (mos 3), although the calcite will be scratched by a knife. In addition, alabaster calcite is a carbonate, so it is powdered if it reacts with chloride acid, while the lypsum albaster remains virtually unaffected when exerted.",

Pluralism applies to action that leads to the confession of religious freedom, freedom of thought, or freedom of information, so that to reach pluralism requires maturity of one's personality and/or group of people. In social science, pluralism is a framework where there are interactions of several groups that show respect and tolerance for each other. They live together (coexistence) and produce results without conflict assimilation. Pluralism is said to be one of the characteristics of modern society, social groups, and most importantly, perhaps a major driver of progress in science, society, and economic development. In an authoritarian society or oligarchy, there is a concentration of political power and decisions made by few members. On the contrary, in the pluralistic society, power and decision-making (and power) are more widespread. It is believed that this results in broader participation and commitment from members of society, therefore better results. For example, companies, economic political bodies, and scientific meetings that are included in groups and situations where pluralism is important.

Religious pluralism thrives in the Christian-west community because of at least three things: that is, in Christian tradition, there are three ways of approach or theological view of other religions. On July 28, 2005, MUI published a fatwa prohibiting pluralism. In that fatwa, religious pluralism, as an object of an answerable issue, is defined as: \"A understanding which teaches that all religions are the same and therefore the truth of every religion is relative; therefore, every believer must not claim that only his religion is true while the other religion is wrong.

The layman often links the word ionic radiation (for example, as happens in nuclear weapons, nuclear reactors, and radioactive substances), but it can also refer to electromagnetic radiation (that is, radio waves, infrared light, visible light, ultraviolet light, and X-rays), acoustic radiation, or for other more obvious processes. What makes radiation is that energy is emitting (that is, moving out in a straight line in all directions) from a source. This geometry naturally leads to the same system of measurements and physical units apply to all kinds of radiation. Some radiation can be dangerous. Some types of radiation have enough energy to ionize particles. In general, it involves an electron that's thrown out of the electron's atomic shell, which will provide a positive charge. This often interferes with the biological system, and it can cause mutations and cancers. Radiation types generally occur in radioactive waste radioactive decay and waste. Three major types of radiation were discovered by Ernest Rutherford, Alpha, Beta, and gamma rays. The radiation was discovered through simple experiments, Rutherford used a radioactive source and discovered that light produced hit three different areas. One of them became positive, one of them was neutral, and one of them was negative. With this data, Rutherford concluded that radiation consists of three rays. He named it after the first three letters of the Greek alphabet alpha, beta, and gamma. Alpha decay is the type of radioactive decay where the atomic nucleus emits alpha particles, and thus transforms (or 'whole') into atoms with mass numbers 4 less and atomic numbers 2 less.",

This radiation is less ionized than alpha, but more than gamma rays. Electrons can often be stopped by a few centimeters of metal. This radiation occurs when neutron decay becomes protons in the nucleus, releasing beta particles and an antineutrino. The radiation beta plus is positron emissions. So, unlike \u25aa \u25aa \u25aa . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . can not occur in isolation, because it requires energy, neutron mass is greater than that of protons. The decay can only happen inside the nucleus when the energy value that binds from the parent nucleus is smaller than the nucleus. The difference between this energy getting into the proton's conversion reaction to neutrons, positrons and antineutrinos, and into kinetic energy from gamma radiation particles or gamma rays is an energy form produced by radioactivity or other subatomic processes like the destruction of electrons. The gamma radiation is composed of photons with frequency greater than 1019 Hz. The gamma radiation is not electrons or neutrons so that it cannot be stopped with just paper or air, the absorption of gamma rays is more effective on matter with high atomic numbers and density. If gamma rays are moving through a matter then the absorption of gamma radiation is proportional to the thickness of the material's surface. The non-ionization radiation, instead, refers to a type of radiation that doesn't carry enough energy per photon to ionize atoms or molecules.

Equivalently, deism can also be defined as a view that places the existence of God as the cause of all things, recognizing its perfection but rejecting divine revelations or the direct intervention of God in the universe by miracles. This view also rejects revelations as a source of religious knowledge and asserts that with reason and observation of the world is sufficient to determine the existence of a single creator or the absolute principle of the universe. Deist usually rejects the occult and tends to assert that God (or \"the Almighty One) has a plan for the universe not to interfere in human life or to reprieve the laws of the universe.

Deism stands out during the 17th and 18th centuries of Enlightenment, especially in Britain, France and America. The word \"deism\" comes from a Latin deus that is interpreted as God or god. From this word, the concept of God's existence is explained by conditions that separate from the universe at great distances. Deism believes that God only plays a part in many things, the creation of the universe and does not play a role in its arrangement.

Initially, archea was classified as a bacteria and was named after archaeacteria (in Archaebacteria kingdom), but this classification was no longer used. Archea cells have a unique trait that separates archea from two other domains of life, Bacteria and Eukaryota. The Arkea is divided into several filums. The classification is difficult because the majority of the archea has not been isolated in the lab and only detected the gene sequence from samples taken from the environment. Arkea and bacteria generally have similar sizes and shapes, although some archea have very strange shapes, such as flat, rectangular cells like Haloquadratum walsbyi. Although there are morphological similarities between archea and bacteria, archea has genes and several metabolic pathways that are more similar to eukaryota, especially enzymes involved in transcription and translatation. One aspect of the archea biochemical unique is the dependency of the archeatic lipid ether on their cell membranes. Arkea uses more energy than eukaryota, which ranges from such organic compounds as sugar, ammonia, metal ions, or even hydrogen gas. The salt - tolerant Arkea (Haloarchaea) uses sunlight as a source of energy, while other species of archea fixate carbon; yet, unlike plants and phenobacterials, no archea does both. Arkea reproduces sexually with binary division, fragmentation, or shoots. Unlike bacteria and eukariota, no species of archea are known to form endospora. The first Arkea observed was an extremist living in extreme environments, such as hot springs and salt lakes without other organisms.",

They are part of microbiota for all organisms. As a human microbiota, archeatics play an important role in the colon, oral cavity, and skin. Morphological, metabolic, and geographical diversity allows them to have a broad ecological role, such as in carbon fixation in the carbon cycle, a role in the nitrogen cycle, the rotation of organic compounds, and the preservation of symbiotic communities and microbial synths. No clear example has been found for pathogenic or parasitic archea. On the other hand, archea is often a qualityist or a commensurate, such as a methane that lives in human digestive tracts and ruminansia, where they live in large quantities and helps the digestive. Metanogens are used in biogas production and waste processing. Meanwhile, enzymes from extremists that can survive high temperatures and organic solvents are used in biotechnology. In most of the 20th century, procariota was considered a group of organisms and was classified based on their biochemical, morphological properties, and metabolism. Microbiologists try to classify microorganisms based on the structure of cell walls, shapes, and substances they consume. In 1965 Linus Pauling and Emile Zuckerkandl proposed using gene sequences in various procaritas to identify their relationship with one another. This approach, known as phylogenetics, is the primary method used today. The Arkea (was the first known metanogen) was first classified as a separate group of bacteria on a filogentic tree based on their RNA ribosomal (rRNA) gene sequence by Carl Woese and George E.

This usually lasts for a few seconds. In part, orgasmism is also a psychological experience of pleasure and release, when the mind is focused solely on the sensation of personal experience. Orgasm is sometimes called climax or exit. In the original research of the human sexual response cycle, orgasm is the third stage of four stages, after the increase and before the completion phase. Another widely accepted sex response model developed by Helen Singer Kaplan, MD, PhD. It involves only three stages: passion, pleasure and orgasm. Orgasms differ from one person to another and even for each individual at a different time. Sometimes orgasms are a raging and amazing wave of sensations, while others are lighter, smoother and less powerful. The intensity of orgasm can be attributed to physical factors, such as fatigue and the length of time since the last orgasm, as well as psychosocial factors, including moods, relationships with partners, activities, hopes, and feelings about the experience. There are some physiological components of orgasm. First, orgasm is the response of the whole body, not just the state of the hip. Brain wave patterns have shown real changes during orgasms, and muscles in many different areas of the body contract during this sexual response stage. Some people experience accidental facial muscle contractions, producing micromics that seem like meringing or uncomfortable expressions or unpleasantness, but these are actually indications of high sexual stimuli. Studies show that women's orgasmal areas do not depend only on genital areas but also on body areas that can cause women to orgasm when properly stimulated.",

Some of the first contractions are strong and close to each other, occurring in intervals of about 0.8 seconds. While orgasms continue, contractions will decrease both in intensity and in length, and they occur at less intervals. Despite the anatomy difference between male and female genitalia, orgasms in men and women are psychologically and psychologically, or subjective, very similar. In fact, studies have been done where experts can't determine genders for sure when reading images of orgasms that all of their anatomy clues have been eliminated. Women have explained that the sensation of orgasm begins with a tense feeling, which is followed quickly by a sense of favor that usually begins with clitoris and spread to the hips. The genitalia is often described as being warm, such as being electrocuted or amused, and this physical sensation usually spreads through some parts of the body. Most women also feel muscle contractions in their vagina or lower hips, often referred to as 'fleshing'. The subjective feelings of orgasm in men have been described quite consistently as beginning with the deep sensation of warmth or pressure associated with 'ejaculation inevitable', the stage in which ejaculation cannot be stopped.

Metal-like inorganic compounds also experience a haloological reaction. Organic compounds, saturated and unsatisfied, reactable, usually explosive, with fluorescents. Fluorinating with elemental fluorescent (F2) requires very special conditions and equipment. Many important organic compounds are commercially fluorinated electrochemically using hydrogen fluoride as a source of fluorescents. This method is called electrochemical fluorination. In addition to F2 and its forms of electrochemically produced, fluoride fluorinator reagers are known as xenon difluoride and cobalt. Chlorination in general is extremely exothermic. Both saturated and unsaturated compounds react directly with chlorins, the first usually requires UV light to start homolysis chlor. Chlorination is done on a large industrial scale; major processes include routes of 1.2-dileroethana (precursor for PVC), and various chlorinated etanas, as solvents. Bromination is more selective than chlorination because of its less exotic reaction. Brominations are generally performed through Br2 additions in the alkena. For example, brominates are organic synthesis in haliotana anesttics of tricroetilena: Organobromins are the most common organohalides in nature. It's catalyzed by a bromoperoxide enzyme that uses the bromide combined with oxygen as oxidation. The oceans are estimated to release 1-2 million tons of bromoform and 56,000 tons of bromometana a year. Iodine is the most reactive halogen and is reluctant to react with most organic compounds.

The main feature of egalitarian doctrine is the idea that all humans are equal in basic values or moral status. Egalitarianism is the doctrine that all citizens should be granted equal rights. The term egalitarianism has two different definitions. First, egalitarianism as a political doctrine that all people should be treated equally and have the same political, economic, social and civil rights. Second, egalitarianism is a social philosophy that supports the elimination of economic gaps among people, or is commonly called economic egalitarianism or decentralization of power. Some scientific sources define egalitarianism as equality that reflects human nature. Some forms of egalitarian thinking include communism, egalitarianism of law, egalitarianism of luck, political egalitarianism, egalitarianism of gender, race equality and opportunity. The general form of egalitarianism is political and philosophical. One argument is that liberalism provides a democratic society with the means to implement civil reform and provide the framework to develop public policy and provide the right conditions for individuals to realize civil rights. The human equality of British Bill of Rights in 1689 and the Constitution of the United States used people in terms of fundamental rights and responsibilities. The male term in British Bill of Rights refers to the man who was tried for treason; and the proportional terms of Congress in the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.

The Declaration of Independence of the United States is an example of the confirmation of human equality as \"All men are created equal\" and the words of men and men refer to men and women, which is humanity. John Locke is sometimes considered to be the founder of this form. Many states in the United States also use the term \"rights of man\" compared to \"the rights of person\" because it refers to men and women. Feminism is strongly influenced by egalitarian philosophy and becomes a philosophy of equality that focuses on gender. Feminism is distinguished from egalitarianism and exists as its own political and social movement. egaliter theory has been developing for the last two hundred years. Among the widely known philosophy of egaresivism, communism, social anarchism, libertarian socialism, left libertarianism and progresivism, some of which support economic egalitarianism. Whether one of these ideas has been applied significantly in practice is still a controversial question. Anti-egalitarianism or elitism is a form of opposition to egalitarianism. The earliest example of economic egalitarianism is the Chinese agricultural philosophy that says that the economic policy of a country should be based on egalitarian independence. In socialism, social ownership of production tools is sometimes considered to be a form of economic egalitarianism because in an economy based on social ownership, the products produced by industry will increase in the population as a whole compared with the class of personal owners.

In the beginning, it was used for India's vast monarchy ruler, although in its development it was claimed to be the ruler of smaller countries. In Southeast Asia, this title is applied not only to monarchy rulers but also to nobles and high officials. In its context as a monarchy ruler, the maharajah is generally viewed as equal to the emperor and higher than the king. The term Maharaja comes from a combination of two Sanskrit mah\u0101nt- \"Grand\" and r\u0101jan \"master, king\"). Initially, this title was used to refer to a monarchy ruler who had a vast territory with some of the underling rulers in his power. In this sense, another title equivalent to that of the maharajah also used on the Indian continent is Samr\u0101, Chhatarapati, used by the ruler of the Maratha Trophy, and Padshah (Arab: Arakh), used by the ruler of the Mughal Empire.

He was also the grandfather of both Pandawa and Korawa. As a young man, he was named Godbrata, but he changed his name to Bisma after swearing that he would not marry for life. Bisma is an expert in all combat modes and is highly respected by Pandawa and Korawa. According to Mahabharata, he died in a great battle in Kurukshetra by a terrible arrow released by Srikandi with Arjuna's help. In the Book of Bhismaparwa was told that he did not die instantly. He lived for several days and witnessed the destruction of the Korawas. Bisma breathes its last breath when the solstice is in the north (Uttarayana). The Sanskrit monk's name in Sanskrit means \"terrible\" or \"inviting fear\" because he was highly respected by his enemies and his courage was feared by the knights of his day. Godbrata means \"liked by the gods.\" The name of the Godbrata was changed to Bisma since he did the monk-pravaya, which is the vow of celibacy forever and will not inherit his father's throne. Therefore, the monk JUNIMA could also mean \"the one who swore a terrible (great) oath, for he vowed to live forever and not inherit the throne of his kingdom, in order to prevent a disagreement between his descendants and Satyawati's offspring, his stepmother. According to the book of Adiparwa, Bisma is the reincarnation of one of the Eight Wasus called Prabasa. Because Prabasa and the others tried to steal the Resi Wasista's cow, they were condemned to be born as human children. On their way to Earth, they met the goddess Ganga who was also condemned to descend into the world as the wife of King Pratipa's son, Santanu.",

Shortly after marriage, the goddess gave birth, but soon she drowned her child in the Ganges. As promised, Santanu did not forbid such conduct. After seven similar acts, the eighth child survived because the actions of the goddess Ganga were prevented by Santanu who had lost her patience. After being urged, Goddess Ganga explained that the children she was born to were reincarnations of the Eight Wasu who were cursed for trying to steal the Resi Wasista's cow. To alleviate the suffering they had to endure in the human world, the goddess allowed only a temporary life. The eighth child, however, was then named Godbrata a Wasu who was most responsible for the theft of the cow. Hence, the goddess allowed him to live longer than others. In time, Goddess Ganga left Santanu with the eighth child, for Santanu had broken her promise. In the book of Santiparwa it is described that the goddess Ganga took the young godbrata to some place, to study with the prominent gods and resi. Among other things, some of the teachers and sciences that Godbrata accepted: In Adiparwa were told that 36 years after the death of Goddess Ganga, Santanu found her son accidentally downstream the Ganges.

This compound is the second lightest halogen, between fluor and bromin in the periodic table and its properties most of them. Chlorine in shape is yellow-green at room temperature. This element is a highly reactive element and a powerful oxidator: the chlorine has the highest electron amplification and the third highest electronegivity behind oxygen and fluor. The most common chlorin compound, sodium chloride, has been known since ancient times. About 1630, the gas chlorine was first synthesized through chemical reactions, but it has yet to be known as an important substance. Carl Wilhelm Scheele wrote a description of the chlorine gas in 1774, viewing it as an oxide of a new element. In 1809, chemists claimed that this gas may have been a pure element, and this was confirmed by Sir Humphry Davy in 1810, named after the Ancient Greek: \u25aa based on its color. Because of its reactivity, all the chlorine in the Earth's crust is in the form of ion chloride compounds (including kitchen salts). This element is the second most abundant haleogen on earth (after fluor) and the 21st most abundant chemical element in the Earth's crust. This large deposit looks small because most of the chloride is found in seawater. Equipment is commercially produced from salt water with electrolysis. The high potential oxidation of chlorine elements triggers the development of commercial bleach and disinfectant, as well as reagen for many processes in the chemical industry.

Spinoza's mind is rooted in the tradition of Judaism. Spinoza's famous mind is a teaching about the single substance of nature. He is the One, the All-compassionate. Because of his thinking, Spinoza has been called a pantheist-monisticist. Baruch de Spinoza was born in the city of Amsterdam on November 24, 1632. His father was a wealthy merchant. In his childhood, Spinoza had shown such intelligence that many people said that he could become a rabbi. In his life, he not only studied mathematics and natural sciences but also learned Latin, Greek, Dutch, Spanish, French, Jewish, German, and Italian. At the age of 18, Spinoza angered the Jewish community because he doubted the Holy Scriptures as the Revelation of God, criticized the position of Jewish priests, questioned the position of the Jews as Yahweh's chosen people, and the personal involvement of God in human history. The attitude that Spinoza showed to the Jews led the Jewish religious leaders to take a stand. The leaders of the Jewish religion were then troubled by all Spinoza's teachings. These religious leaders constantly insist that Spinoza return to religious orthodoxy, but this never works. Finally in 1656, Spinoza was excommunicated from Sinagoge. Not only did the Jewish exile of Spinoza help his family to excommunicate themselves, but Spinoza remained calm about his life's problems.

The reason Spinoza refused this invitation was because for him there was nothing more terrible than the fact that people were sentenced to death for free thinking. During his life, Spinoza also worked as a personal teacher for some wealthy families and this is where Spinoza met with Dutch political figures at the time, including Jan de Witt. Finally on February 21, 1677 Spinoza died at the age of 44 of tuberculosis of the lungs he had suffered a long time ago. Spinoza's view of a single substance is a response to Descartes' thinking about the matter of substance and the relationship between the soul and the body. In the philosophy of Descartes, there is a problem that is how God, the soul, and the material world can be thought of as a whole unity? In his book Ethica, ordine geometric demonstrata (Ethical proof), Spinoza tried to answer this problem. He began to answer the problem of Descartes philosophy by giving an understanding of substance. Substantity is understood as something within itself and thinks by itself, meaning something that the concept doesn't require any other concept to form. According to Spinoza, substance properties are eternal, infinite, absolute, and singular. For Spinoza, only one can fulfill this definition of God.

Some countries have cut off or separated territories in other countries that, depending on their characteristics, can be called enclave areas and/or exklave. These areas are generally created for historical, political or geographical reasons behind them. For example, peace agreements between two opposing countries, zoning agreements by colonial nations, and the struggle of an area in war. The term \"enklave\" comes from the French word enclave, which is the derivative of enclaver (1283), from everyday Latin inclavare. The word enclave first appeared in the middle of the 15th century, and at first it was a legal term of property that showed the situation of a plot of land or a garden surrounded by different owners, while the land could not be cultivated practically and simply wore \"burden\" on its surrounding lawn (like crossing someone else's land or running water through someone else's land). Legally, this creates the conditions for the soil around which others live.

Today, the perca sap is used in medicine (gultapercha), while the sawo manila latex is used for chewing gum (chicles). The industrial rubber can now be produced synthetically and competed in the drag industry. Rubber is a polymer of polyprena units arranged from 5000 to 10,000 units in a branchless chain. Allegedly, the first three ties are trans and the next cis. This compound is contained in the latex of its tree. At normal temperatures, rubbers are not shaped. At low temperatures he will crystallize. With temperatures rising, the rubber will expand, in the direction of its long axis. The drop in temperature will bring back this inflated state. This is why rubbers are elastic. The latex is formed on the surface of small objects (called \"strut body\") in a spherical size of 5 nm to 5 \u25aam which is largely found in the cytosol of latex vessels (modified from floem). As a substrate is isopentenil diphosphate (IPD) produced by latex vessel cells. With the help of catalysis from prenil transferase, a nomination occurs on the surface of a rubber body that carries a 14-kda polypede called rubber intangation factor. As the starter's making material, it is also necessary for 3.3 dimetilylphosphate as a second substrate. An enzyme isomerase is required for this task. Most commercial rubbers come from rubber tree sap (the rubber tree) or Hevea brasiliensis.",

Quantity of the solute that can dissolve in certain solvent volumes vary from temperature to temperature. The most common solvent in everyday life is water. Other solvents also commonly used are organic chemicals (containing carbon) also called organic solvents. The solvent usually has a low boiling point and is easier to evaporate, leaving the soluted substance at its disposal. To distinguish between the solvent and the dissolved substance, solvents are usually found in larger amounts. The common use of organic solvents is found in dry washing (e.g. tetraloethylene), such as the thinner cat (for example, the toluena, the pentine), as a nail polish remover and the glue solvent (aseton, ethylate), in stain removers (e.g. hexs, hexs, etherum ether), in lemon perfume and perfume. Prohibitions form from a mixture of homogeneous substances, where solvents have more components than solute. A solution with the maximum amount of solute at certain temperatures is called saturated solution. The number of solutes in one litre of saturated solution at certain temperatures is called solute. If a solvent is inserted into a solvent, then the particles of the solute will spread throughout the solvent. The ease of solute particles replace solvent molecules depends on the relative strength of interaction between solvents, interactions between the soluted substances, and interactions between the soluted solvents. If pulling the solute is more powerful than pulling the solvent-solute and pulling the solute-solute in, then the solvent process is going to take place, this process is called an exothermic reaction.",

The organic solvent is a typical solvent containing carbon atoms in its molecules. In organic solvents, the solute is based on the coordination and constant capacity of its electricity. Organic solvents can be polar and non-polar depending on the pattern group they have. In the process of solvent in organic solvents, it's usually a slow reaction that takes energy that comes from warming to optimizing the state of the solvent. The resulting reduction is not an electrical conductor. The examples of organic solvents are compounds with alcohol functionality, ether, ester, ketons, and so on. Meanwhile, inorganic solvents are solvents besides water that have no organic components in them. In inorganic solvents, solutes are linked to the concept of solvent systems capable of autonoizing the solvent. Usually inorganic solvents are polar solvents so as not to dissolve in organic and non-polar solvents. The resulting reducers are good electrical conductors. Examples of inorganic solvents are ammonia and sulfuric acid. The solvent with relatively static permitivity values is greater than 15 (such as poles or polarization) can be divided into protics and aprotics. Protic solvents dissolve anions strongly through hydrogen bonds. Water includes the protic polar solvent. Solutes such as acetone or chlorometane tend to have a big pattern moment (separation of negative partial charge and positive partial charge in the same molecule) and dissolving a positive issue through the negative dial. In the chemical reaction of the protic polar solvent supports the SN1 reaction mechanism, while the aprotic polar solvent supports the SN2. The solvent is grouped into non-polar solvent, aprotic polar, and polarized and sorted based on a polar increase in polarity.",

Molekul benzene composed of six carbon atoms that bond in a ring, with one hydrogen atom attached to each carbon atom. Since benzene contains only carbon and hydrogen atoms, benzene is grouped as hydrocarbons. Benzena is a natural ingredient of crude oil and one of essential petrochemicals. Because the ring has a continuous pi bond between carbon atoms, benzene is classified as aromatic hydrocarbons, n]-anulena (anulena). Benzena is sometimes shortened as PhH. Benzenas are colorless liquids, highly flammable and aromatic. Her presence gives a distinctive scent at the gas station. Its main use is as a precursor of chemical manufacturers with more complex structures, such as ethylbenzene and kumena, which are produced annually by billions of kilograms. Because benzene has high octan numbers, gasoline (bbm) contains aromatic derivatives like xilena and toluena up to 25%. Benzena herself has been restricted to less than 1% in gasoline because it is known as a carcinogen in humans. Her non-industrial applications have been restricted for the same reason. The name \"benzene\" was passed down from \"gom benzoin\" (rein benzoin), a aromatic resin known by a pharmacist and perfume artist Europe since the 16th century as a product of southeast Asia. An acidic material was passed down from benzoin through sublimation, and it was named \"benzoin\" or benzoic acid. Hydrocarbons derived from benzoate acid are then named benzin, benzol, or benzene. Michael Faraday first isolated and identified benzene in 1825 of the oil residue derived from the production of illumination gas, and was named the hydrogen bicarburet.

In 1845, Charles Mansfield, who worked under August Wilhelm von Hofmann, isolated benzene from coal tar. Four years later, Mansfield began production of the first industrial scale benzene, based on the method of tar-rock. Slowly, there appears an inkling among chemists that a number of chemicals are chemically linked to benzene, which consists of a variety of chemical families. In 1855, Hofmann used the word \"arromatic\" to show this family relationship, after many characteristics of its members. In 1997, benzene was detected in space. The empirical formula of benzene has long been known, but the determination of its structure is its own challenge because it is filled with covalence bonds, and each carbon atom binds only one hydrogen atom. Archibald Scott Couper in 1858 and Joseph Loschmidt in 1861 suggested the possibility of a structure containing many skeletons or many rings, but the available evidence was too little to help chemists determine certain structures. In 1865, German chemist Friedrich Kekul\u00e9 published a paper in French (because he was teaching at the Belgian Francophone) suggesting that the structure contained six carbon atoms with a single bond and a double interlocking ring. The following year he published a much longer paper in German on the same subject. Kekul\u00e9 used evidence that had been collected in the following years which is, that there always seemed to be only one isomer of the monoderivative benzene, and that there were always three isomers of each dwisubstitution that were now understood according to the pattern of orto, meta, and the substitution of the gazene arena as an argument that supported the structure of his proposal.",

Unexpected changes in Uranus ' orbit led Alexis Bouvard to conclude that it was caused by gravitational disturbances from an unknown planet. Neptune was further observed by Johann Galle in the position predicted by Urbain Le Verrier. His largest natural satellite, Triton, was discovered immediately thereafter, while 12 other natural satellites were discovered via telescopes in the 20th century.

The ring system was tracked to you in the 1960s and confirmed its existence by Voyager 2 in 1989. Galileo's painting indicates that he first saw Neptune on December 28, 1612, and January 27, 1613. On both days, Galileo mistakenly viewed Neptune as a fixed star when the planet appeared very close to him to Jupiter on the night sky; therefore, he was not considered the inventor of Neptune. At the time of his first observation in December 1612, Neptune was fixed in the sky because the planet had just experienced a policy on that day. This move back formed when Earth's orbit carried the Earth past its outermost planet. Since Neptune had just begun its annual cycle of respectability, the planet's movement was too difficult to trace using Galileo's tiny telescope. In July 2009, physicist David Jamieson announced new evidence that Galileo at least realized that the star he had observed had moved relatively towards the fixed star. In 1821, Alexis Bouvard published the astronomical table of Neptune's neighboring orbit, Uranus. The next observation found a shift from the chart, causing Bouvard to hypothesize that an unknown object was in its orbit in gravitational interaction. In 1843, John Couch Adams began observing Uranus ' orbit using the data he had. Through James Challis, he asked Sir George Airy, the Royal Astronomer, to send the data in February 1844.",

The term communism is often mixed with an international Communist. Communism or Marxism are basic ideologies commonly used by communist parties around the world. Whereas international communism is a blend of these ideologies derived from Lenin's thinking so that it might also be called \"Marxism. \" In communism, social change must begin with the takeover of production tools through the role of the Communist party. Simply put, social change starts with labor or better known as proletariat (see: Sacred Family), but labor organizing can only succeed through party struggles. The party needs the role of Politbiro as a think-tank. Social change can be summed up only if it is published by Politbiro. Communism as anti-capitalism uses the Communist party system as a means of taking over power and is strongly opposed to the ownership of an individual's accumulated capital. In principle all of this is represented as people's property and therefore, all production tools must be controlled by the state for people's prosperity to be equitable. Communism introduced the use of the democratic system of representatives carried out by communist party elites and therefore severely restricted democracy directly to people who were not members of the Communist party because of it in the unknown sense of communism as individual rights are found in liberalism. International Communism as an ideological theory began to apply after the outbreak of the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia on November 7, 1917.

There are several definitions of the government system. Similarly, there are different kinds of governments in the world. In its extensive associative definition, governments generally consist of legislative, executive, and self - standing institutions. Governments are the means to enforce organizational policy, as well as the mechanism for determining policy. Every government has a kind of constitution, which is a statement on the principles and philosophy of its government. Although all kinds of organizations have management, government terms are often used more specifically to refer to some 200 independent national governments and organizations below them. Throughout history, common forms of government include monarchy, aristocracy, timocracy, oligarchy, democracy, theocracy, and tyranny. The main aspect of the philosophy of any government is how political power was acquired. The two main forms were elections and hereditary succession. The beginning and development of the phenomenon of human rule are uncertain; yet, history records the formation of early rulerships. About 5,000 years ago, some small countries appeared. In the third millennium to the second B.C.E., some of these countries developed into larger governmental territories: Sumeria, Ancient Egypt, the Indus Valley civilization, and the Civilization of the Yellow River. The construction of farm projects and waterbending is a catalyst for government development. Sometimes, a chieftain is chosen by various rituals or tests of strength to govern his tribe, sometimes involving a group of older men as a council. The human ability to properly study and communicate abstract information enables humans to act more effectively in farming, which then continues to increase population density.

Britain's Great Revolution, the United States Revolution, and the French Revolution contributed to the growth of governmental representatives. The Soviet Union was the first great country to have communist rule. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, more and more countries have used liberal democracy as a form of their government. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, there was a significant increase in size and scale of government at a national level, including corporate arrangements and welfare development. In political science, the making of typology or taxonomy of political entity has long been a goal because the tipology of the political system is unclear. This is very important in comparative politics and international relationships. Like all categories of government forms, the boundaries of government classification can change or not. On the surface, all governments form official or ideal. The United States was a constitutional republic, while the former Soviet Union was a socialist republic. But self-identification isn't objective and as Copstein and Lichbach political scientists say, defining regimes can be complicated. For example, the French philosopher Voltaire argued that \"The Holy Roman Empire was neither empire nor Roman nor Sacred.\" Identifying a form of government is also difficult because many political systems come from social-economic movements that are then brought into government by parties that call themselves by name of these movements; all with political-ideological rivals. Experiences with powerful movements and strong bonds that they may have with certain forms of government, can cause them to be regarded as a form of government itself. Other complications include general disagreements or deliberate \"distortion or bias\" to the technical definition of political ideology and related form of government due to the political nature of modern times.",

The brain and nerve cells in it are believed to affect human cognitives. Knowledge of the brain affects cognitive psychology. The brain is also responsible for such functions as recognition, emotion.

Glia serves to support and protect neurons, while neurons carry information in the form of electrical pulses known as action potential. They communicate with other neurons and throughout the body by sending out various chemicals called neurotransmitters. This neurotransmitter was sent to a gap known as synapses. An insectlike avertebrate may have millions of neurons in its brain, a large vertebrate can have up to a hundred billion neurons. Brain neurons contain two types of PUFA fatty acid, which is aaridonic acid (AA) and docosahexanoic acid (DHA) located at the position of sn2 molecules of phosphoglycerides in the membrane of neuron cells. PUFA can be detached from phosphoglyceride by phospholipase stimulation PLA-2.

Investment is a function of income and interest rate, seen in relation to I=10. An increase in income would encourage a larger investment, where higher interest rates would lower interest in investments as they would be more expensive than borrowing money. Even if another company chooses to use its own funds for investment, interest rates show an opportunity to invest the funds rather than lend to get interest.

He was a king who ruled the kingdom of Kuru, with a government center in Hastinapura. He is the oldest among the five Pandavas, or the sons of Pandu. In the tradition of rectification, Judidstira was named prebu and had the nickname Puntadives, while her kingdom was named after the Kingdom of Amarta. The name Judestira in Sanskrit means \"tea or solid in war.\" Indeed, He is the All-mighty, the All-wise. Some of the other nicknames that Yudhisthira had are Kuruja (Puriah, \"the leader of the Kuru people\"), Kurundana (Curupati Dynasty), Kuruhati (The King of the Kuru Dynasty), Pandawa (Badwa, \"son of Pandu\"), Parta (The Son of Prita or Kunti). Some of the above are also used by other Kuru Dynasty figures, such as Arjuna, Bisma, and Duryodana. In addition to the above names, Java has several other names or nicknames for the Judicistira, for example: \"The Puntadores\" (\"The height of the height of the gods\") (\"The cleverness of fighting against personal passion\"), (\"The cleverness of the language\"), Samiaji (\"to honor others as yourself\"). Judestira is the eldest son of the Pandu and Kunti couple, the king and queen of the Kuru Dynasty, with a government center at Hastinapura. The first part of the Mahabharata (Adiparwa) tells of Pandu's curse after killing a brahmana named Resi Kindama by accident. The Brahmin was hit by Pandu's arrow when he and his wife were copulating in the form of a pair of deer. Toward his death, the Kindaama Resi had a chance to condemn Pandu that he would one day die while having sex with his wife.",

After long absences of offspring, Pandu expressed her intention to have children. Kunti who mastered Adityahredaya's spell soon fulfilled her husband's wish. That spell is divine summoning for a son. By using the spell, Kunti managed to bring in Dharma's god and obtain his son's gift without going through the body. The first son was named Judidstira. Jude thus became the firstborn son of Pandu, a result of Dharma's gift, the god of justice and wisdom. The story of the Javanese railway is quite different. According to this version, the Puntadore is the biological son of Pandu born in the palace of Hastinapura. Bhatara Dharma's arrival simply saved Punt god's birth and gave her his blessing. Thanks to the god's help, the Puntadore was born through Kunti's dew. In Java's history, the name Puntadom was used more frequently, whereas the name Judidstira was not used until he grew up and became king. This version describes the Punt god as a white - blooded man, who is a figurative figure that he is a holy heart and always upholds the truth. Judestira and her four younger siblings, Bima (Bimasena), Arjuna, Nakula, and Sademura returned to Hastinapura after their father died. At that time, Hastinapura was led by Dretarastra, Pandu's blind brother. The five sons of Pandu, who were known as the Pandavas, made their cousins, Drentarastra's sons (a hundred Korawa led by Duryodana) feel jealous. Bisma (an elder of the Kuru dynasty) and Widura (prime minister) preferred Judetira over the son of Dretarastra, so Duryodana became anxious when Jude was crowned the crown prince.

There are three forms of polygamy, namely: The three forms of polygamy are found in history, but polygamy is the most common form. Although allowed in some cultures, polygamy is opposed by some. Mainly feminists oppose polyginis, as they regard polygy as a form of oppression for women. Poligini and polyandri were carried out by an ancient Hindu society. Yet, in its historical practice, only certain kings and caste perform polygamy. Polygamy may also happen because it is forced to do so for various reasons, such as having no descendants or political goals of Hindu kings. The Hindu Scriptures clearly forbid polygamy. The part of Manawa Dharmasastra, which is used to hold Hindu law, the 3rd book (Tritio \u25aadhayayah), article 5 reads: The marriage that is recommended is between one girl and one man in which there is no close blood relationship.

He asked for five times so that in his reincarnation as Di Tuadi, Lord Shiva granted him five husbands of the great knights. In Buddhism, the subject of polygamy is not explained in direct order, because the Buddha did not establish any religious laws related to domestic life, but there are valuable suggestions on how to live a praiseworthy household life. Buddha Sidharta Gautama did not establish religious laws related to domestic life but gave advice on how to live a praiseworthy household life. Although Buddha did not mention anything about the number of wives a man could have, he firmly stated that a married man then went to another woman who was not in a marriage bond, it could be the cause of his own collapse. He will face problems and other obstacles. Buddha's teachings only explain a condition and its consequences. People can think for themselves which is good and which is bad. After all, if the laws of the state establish that marriage must be monogamy, it must be obeyed.

The position of the lithosphere is above the floating rock that is relatively easy to move from one to another. The average thickness of the lithosphere is 100 kilometers with the formation of earth's crust and coats. The lithosphere position is adjacent to the astenosphere. The Litosphere includes a strong layer located above the weak astenosphere. The position of the lithosphere makes it easy to descend into the astenosphere. The drop in the lithosphere to the astenosphere is influenced by the strain and force of the rock. The Litosphere comes from the word lithos which means rock, and the sphere means layer. Literally the lithosphere is the most extraordinary or unusual layer of the Earth called the skin of the Earth. In this layer, this is typically a chemical compound rich in Si02, which is why the litosphere layer is often called a sylicate layer and has an average thickness of two kilometers, which is the upper Litosphere (a land of about 35% or 1/3 parts) and the lower Litosphere (as an ocean of approximately 65% or 2/3 parts). The Earth's Litosphere includes the crust and the topmost part of the Earth's coat, resulting in the harshest outer layer of planet Earth. The Litosphere is supported by the astenosphere, which is a weaker, hotter, and deeper part of the coat. The limit between the lithosphere and the astenosphere is distinguished in terms of its response to voltage: the lithosphere remains dense in a relatively long geologic period and changes elasticly because of cracks, while the astenosphere changes like a viscous fluid. The Litosphere breaks down into several tectonic plates that result in the convection that occurs in the astenosphere. The concept of the lithosphere as the strongest layer of the outermost layer of the Earth was developed by Barrel in 1914, who wrote a series of paper papers to support the concept.",

Although the theory of lithosphere and astenosphere developed before plate plate theory was developed in 1960, the concept of the existence of the strong layer (lithosphere) and the weak layer (astenosphere) remained an important part of the theory. There are two types of ocean Litospheres with a depth of 200 miles, while the continent's lithosphere has a depth of 40.200 km. Continent crust is distinguished by the upper coat layer because of the existence of the Mohorovicic layer. The Litosphere is at the top of the astenosphere layer. The volume of the lithosphere is at least 60 kilometers while the thickness of the astenosphere is at least 650 kilometers. The existence of the lithosphere above the astenosphere is a result of temperature differences that control the power of rock. The astenosphere layer has a temperature 750 \u00b0 C which is the temperature when the rock on the coat first grows weaker. An average temperature that stands between the lithosphere and the atmosphere is 1,300 \u00b0C. In plate tectonic theory, the lithosphere is composed of molten rock and plastis. These rocks can flow if they are affected by a voltage. Empirically, the lithosphere floats over the earth's coat. The Litosphere was split into several tectonic plates. On earth, the lithosphere is divided into 13 tectonic plates on a large and small scale. These tectonic plates include Pacific plates, Eurasia plates, the Indo himtralia plates, the African plates, the North American plates, the South American plates, the Antarctic tablets, the Nazca plates, the Arabian plates, the Caribbean plates, the Filipino plates, the Scotia plates, and the Cocos tablets.",

In contrast to today's and its subcontinental mass, most of Pangea is in the southern hemisphere and surrounded by the super-sea, Panthalasta. Pangea is the most recent supercontinent that ever existed and was first reconstructed by geologists. The name Pangea is derived from Ancient Greece, the \"all\" pan and Gaia meaning \"earth.\" The name was created in the 1927 symposium discussed by Alfred Wegener about the theory of the shift of the continent. In his book The Origin of Continents and Oceans (Die Entstehung der Continente und Ozear), first published in 1915, he guessed that all continents at one time had once formed a single supercontinent that he called \"Urcontinent\", before it broke out and drifted away to their current location. Pangea's existence was first proposed in 1912, however, long before the discovery of these tools developed the modern theory of tectonic plates. German Meteorologist Alfred Wegener, first presented the concept of Pangea (which means \"all land\") along with the first comprehensive theory of continent shifting, the idea that the continents on earth are slowly moving relatively towards each other, at a conference in 1912 and then in his book The Origins of Continents and Oceans (1915).

Wegener shows that large lines, geoformolophy, and climate belts in eastern South America are similar to those on the southwest coast of Africa. He also argued that fossils of plants and animals appeared on both continents and that when they were alive, these organisms might not have crossed the width of the South Atlantic which is currently separating both continents. So logic states that South America and Africa were once part of the same land. Wegener concluded that South America and Africa (also others) were connected to each other, perhaps through a land bridge, some 250 million years ago. He also believed that Pangea had been almost throughout the history of the Earth. Wegener relied on the work of Austrian geologist Eduard Sues, who (though he was a great supporter of the drowning continents) first developed the concept of Gondwanaland \u25aa a Supercontinent that survived from 600 to 180 million years ago and is composed of today's Africa, South America, Australia, India, and Antarctica. Suess sees rock formations in India that compare well in terms of age and composition with similar formations in different southern continents. Wegener used the Suess work to support the hypothesis of the continent's own shift and consider Gondwanaland as the southern part of Pangea. Despite this geological and peleontological evidence, the theory of the shifting of the Wegener continent is not accepted by the scientific community, because its explanation of the driving force behind the continent's movement (which is said to be derived from a force of attraction that shows the Earth's equivalnal ridge or gravitational pull of the...

The uniformity observed in the past will appear both in the present and in the future. The participants of nature's uniformity are used to justify both inductive reasoning and scientific research. It is simply understood that the future will look like the past. Thus, we can predict what will happen in the future by seeing what happened in the past. A science depends greatly on uniformity because without it it's impossible to conclude past events that we can expect to happen in the future. Moreover, scientific predictions and scientific theories would not be possible without uniformity. In general, inductive reasoning depends on uniformity because it allows us to take certain cases and conclude them by general rules and principles. However, the uniformity of nature itself cannot depend on inductive reasoning. In geological science, uniformitarianism has included the concept of gradualistics where \"the present is the key to the past\" and that current geological events happen at the same rate as always, although many modern geologists are no longer holding on to strict gradualism. Created by William Whewell, uniformitarianism was originally proposed as opposed to the theory of catattrophism presented by British naturalists at the end of the 18th century.

UN Agency such as the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency), UNIDO (United Nations Industrial Development Organization), OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) is based largely on VIC: Vienna International City. Vienna rose from the destruction of World War II to a city of modern industry and communication centers. After a period of construction, Vienna rebuilt its glories as a center of culture and art, music, theater, shiniers, and tourism. Vienna is in northeastern Austria, 65 kilometers each from the Czech or Hungarian Republic to the east. The area is 45 km2, surrounded by the Austrian State (Bundesland) Hilir. As the center of the national railway, Vienna was passed by the west train (Westbahn) as far as Salzburg. It was originally a former Orient Express route connecting Istanbul (Turki) to Calais (France) from 1883-2009.",

In the field of mathematics, logic, analysis is the process of solving a complex problem into small parts so it can be easier to understand. In the field of chemistry, analysis is the deciphering of a substance into a simpler substance that forms its elements. In linguistics, analysis is a study carried out on a language in order to examine the language structure in depth.

This can be a simple redoxyxic process such as carbon oxidation that produces carbon dioxide, or carbon reduction by hydrogen produces methane (CH4), or it can be a complex process such as sugar oxidation in the human body through a complex array of electron transfers. The redox term comes from two concepts, which is reduction and oxidation. It can easily be explained this way: Although it is appropriate to use it for various purposes, the above explanation is not exactly correct. Oxidation and reduction actually refer to the change in oxidation numbers because the actual electron transfer won't always happen. So oxidation is better defined as an increase in oxidation, and reduction as a decrease in oxidation numbers. In practice, electron transfers will always change oxidation numbers, but there are a lot of reactions classified as \"redoxes\" even though there are no electron transfers in that reaction (e.g. involving covalent bonds). Non-redox reactions that don't involve formal charge changes (formal charge) are known as methesis reactions. ReductionOxidant + e\u25aa ProducectElectrons gathered; oxidation number decreases) The oxidator releases electrons from other compounds, so itself is reduced. Because it \"receives\" the electron, it's also referred to as an electron receiver. Oxidators may be compounds with high oxidation numbers (such as H, Mno, CrO3, Cr, OSO4) or really electronegative compounds, so that they can get one or two more electrons by oxidizing a compound (e.g. oxygen, fluorin, chlorin, and bromin).",

        "paragraph": "Compounds that have the ability to reduce other compounds are said to be reductive and known as a reducer or agent. Reductor releases its electrons into another compound, so it itself gets oxidized. Because it \"donorizes\" its electrons, it's also referred to as the electron donor. The compounds of reformers vary greatly. Metal elements like Li, Na, Mg, Fe, Zn, and Al can be used as reformors. These metals will give away its electrons easily. Another type of reformer is the hybrid transfer reagen, e.g. NaBH4 and LiAlH4), these reagens are used extensively in organic chemistry, especially in the reduction of carbonil compounds into alcohol. Another useful reduction method involves hydrogen gas (H2) with palladium, platinum, or nickel, which is primarily used to reduce double bond ata three carbon-carbon bond. An easy way to look at the redox process is to transfer its electrons to oxidators. So in reaction, the conductor releases electrons and oxidizes, and the oxidators get electrons and are reduced. An oxidator and conductor couple involved in a reaction are referred to as a redox pair. One example of the redox reaction is between hydrogen and fluorin: we can write this whole reaction as two half reaction: oxidation and a half-redirection reaction would make the entire chemical process more clear. Since there is no total yield of charge during redox reactions, excessive number of electrons in oxidation reactions must be equal to the amount consumed in reduction reactions. The elements, even in the molecular form, often have zero oxidation numbers. In the above reaction, hydrogen is oxidized from oxidation number 0 to +1, while fluorine is reduced from oxidation to -1. When oxidation and reduction reactions are combined, the electrons involved will reduce each other: and ions will join together to form hydrogen fluoride: Redox occurs in a single replacement reaction or a substitution reaction.",

The Earth has evolved through geological and biological processes by leaving traces of its original condition. The outer surface is divided into several migrating plate tectonics. The interior remains active, with a thick layer of plastic coats and full iron cores that produce magnetic fields. Life has changed the atmosphere of the Earth, which creates an ecological balance that stabilizes surface conditions.

The combination of these two could be a whole new scale called speed and acceleration. The movement in an object is generally influenced by two types of energy, which is potential energy and kinetic energy. The change in motion can be divided into two types, oscillation and non - oscillation motion. The size of physics on straight motion is some of the properties of physics on things that when moving can be measured. The change in location is by comparing the location of the object to a no-moved point or called the reference point, so motion has a relative or nisbi definition.

The function of these cells includes fluid filtration (as in kidney glomerulus), blood vessels tonnes, hemostasis, neutrophil delivery, and hormone traffic. The endotelium surface in the heart chamber is called the endocardium. Endotelium comes from mesoderm. Blood capillaries and lymphatics are made up of layered endotel cells called ecalypse. In a straight part of the blood vessel, the endotel vascular cells usually align and lengthen toward the flow of fluid. The basic anatomic model makes the difference between endotel cells and epitel cells based on what tissue develops into those tissues and the existence of the vimentary filament instead of the ape filament separating endotel cells from epitel cells.

Sustainable agriculture, also known for its variations such as organic agriculture or permaculture, includes aspects of sustainability for both land and environment and local knowledge as an important factor in its efficiency calculations.

Alcohol is often used to mention ethanol, also called alcohol Grain, and sometimes for alcoholic beverages. This is because of ethanol used as a basic ingredient in the drink, not a methanol, or any other alcohol group. So is alcohol used in the pharmaceutical world. Alcohol is meant to be ethanol. In fact, alcohol in chemistry has an even broader understanding. The important alcohol classes, where methanol and ethanol are the simplest parts, include all compounds that have a general CnH2n+1OH formula. The suffix of -ol appears in the IUPAC chemical naming of all the substances found in hydroxil groups as the highest priority functional group. When a higher priority group is present inside the compound, the prefix of hydroxy is used in its IUPAC name. The suffix of -ol in non-IUPAC (such as paracetamol or cholesterol) also indicates that it is alcohol. However, many of the substances containing hydroxil functions (especially sugar, such as glucose and sucrosa) have names that do not include the suffix of -ol, or the prefix of hydroxion. A functional cluster of alcohol is a group of hydroxsils bound to carbon hybridization sp3. There are three major types of alcohol - primer, master, and pioneer. These names refer to the amount of carbon attached to carbon C-OH. The simplest primary alcohol is methanol. The simplest secondary alcohol is 2-propanol, and the simplest alcohol is 2-methyl-2-propanol. The word \"alcohol\" is derived from Arabic kohl (Arabic:",

Alcohol was originally used for very fine powder produced through the natural mineral sublimation stybnit to form trisulfida antimon Sb2S3. This compound is considered to be an essence or a spirit of this mineral. The compound is used as antiseptic, eyeliner, and cosmetics. The meaning of alcohol is expanded to generally distilled substances, and then narrows it down to ethanol, when \"singrit\" is used as a synonym for booze. Bartholomew Traheron, in John of Vigo's translation in 1543, introduced the word as the term used by the writer \"bar\" (a Moorish) for \"fine bush.\" Vigo wrote: \"the barbaric auctours use alcohol, or (as I fynde it sometymes wryten) alcofoll, for moost fine poudre.\" (The translation: \"The barbarians use alcohol, or (as I sometimes write) alcofoll, for the finest powder.\") Lexicon Chymicum in 1657, by William Johnson translated the word \"antimonium sive stibium.\" In other words, it refers to whatever liquids are obtained by distilling, including \"wine alcohol,\" distilled wine essences. Libavius in Alchymia (1594) refers to \"vini alcohol vel vinum alcalimatam\". Johnson (1657) translated alcohol vini as \"quando omnis superfluitas vini a vino separature, ita ut accensum ardeat doc totum consumatur, nihilque f\u00e6cum aut phlegmatis in fundo remaneat.\" The translation was limited to \"shrith wine\" (the chemical known today as ethanol) in the 18th century and expanded to a class of substances called \"alcohol\" in modern chemistry after 1850.

The story of the magical cow struggle involving Jamadagni and Kartawurya Arjuna is similar to the legend of the dispute between King Wiswamitra and Resi Wasista. Once upon a time, King Kartawurya Arjuna and her troops from the Kingdom of Hehaya came to visit the Jamadagni dorm. The resi serve him so unzimably. When Kartawurya Arjuna begged Jamadagni to give Kamadhenu's magic cow in the dorm, Jamadagni firmly rejected it. Ambitious of having Kamadhenu's cow, Kartawurya Arjuna resorted to violence. The cow was taken by force. Parasuram became angry when she learned that Kartawurya Arjuna was taking her father's cow. Parasurama took Shiva's ax, then cut off a thousand Kartawurya Arjuna's arms, after which he cut off his head. One morning Renuka failed to provide water for the ceremony to be held by Jamadagni. Jamadagni asked his son to punish his mother. Besides Parasaturama, the entire son of Jamadagni was not willing to punish his mother. Finally Jamadagni condemned them to stone. After Parasaturama managed to cut off her mother's head, her father gave Parasaturama a chance to ask for two gifts. The opportunity was taken advantage of by Parasatura. First, Parasatura asked for her brothers to be converted back into human beings. Second, Parasaturama requests that her mother be brought back to life.

With the songs of the Sex Pistols, anarchism became a joke about nihilist self-awareness, but Crass stood to have direct contact with the socialist liberation people and to be a commercial variation of political thinking in the 20th century. By bringing the manifesto of punk, \"Do It Yourself,\" Crass united the usefulness of songs, movies, collages, images and subversion movements to present innovative and sustainable criticism against everything they see as a culture built on the foundation of war, violence, sexism, religious hypocrisy and consumerism. They're also fighting along with people who are anarko-pasphysics which is a huge movement in punk music environments. The band was formed when the founder of the Dial House and former EXIT group member, a performance group of art avant-garde, Penny Rimbaud, began playing music with a Clash fan, Steve Ignorant, who lived in the Dial House. The two of them recorded a song called \"The drums and vocals.\" For a very short time they called themselves Stormtrooper, before choosing the name Crass, which was taken from David Bowie's song, \u25aaZiggy Stardust. Other members of the house started to include themselves in the band, and it lasted long enough before Crass played his first show as a filler for the Squatted Street Festival on Huntley Street, North London.

The shows are watched by few people; \"The audience is usually just us when the Subs play, and only the Subs when we play. \", says Penny Rimbaud. Shortly thereafter, the band decided to play more seriously, giving their appearance more attention. By avoiding drugs, alcohol and marijuana before their performance on stage, they also adapt political minds to the use of black clothes, styles of clothing that are more inclined to the military, on stage or in everyday life. They also introduced the use of a backdrop stage, a logo drawn by Rimbaud's friend Dave King (forming Sleeping Dogs Lie), as shown behind the cover of The Feeding Of The 5000 album. This made the band famous for its military style, which led some to accuse them of being a fascist band. Crass mentions that their black uniform performance is the point of their statement against \"principation of personality,\" thus, to be contrary to most other rock bands, there is no member referred to as leader of the band.

In this study, because of a symptom, it will be tested to see if the cause (free variable) affects the effects of the variables. This research is widely used to acquire knowledge in the fields of social science and psychology. Experimental research was originally taken from Natural Science and started in the study of psychology. Wilhelm M. Wundt, a German psychologist, introduced experimental methods into psych studies. Wundt set up an experimental laboratory and was made an example by social scientists. The end of the 18th century, Germany as the center of knowledge succeeded in inviting social scientists from all over the world to study the method. By 1900, U.S. researchers and universities in the world had set up psychological laboratories to do experimental research. The birth of experimental experiments in social science has changed the approach of philosophical, introspective, and integrative social sciences into interpretives. In the time of World War II, experimental studies began to be widely used in social areas to explain the study of human mental and social life objectively and undisputed. The use of experimental methods in this era was marked by: 1950 and 1960, this method of experimental research has been widely used in researchers as a way to test hypotheses with small standards of error. Entering 1970, experimental research was increasingly used to evaluate research. And to this day, experimental research is a lot of research, because it's logical, simple, consistent, costs a little bit, and it clearly describes the causal connection of symptoms.",

After a while, it's comparable to what we've done with the first group and the second group.

The way the sample was taken was distinguished into random distribution and matching. Random division means dividing samples that have been selected into two random groups, without being based on a specific sequence with the purpose of comparison. Matching means dividing the sample based on certain characteristics in common. These matching takes are rare because it's difficult for researchers to find common ground between research subjects. After dividing into the two groups, researchers compared the results of experiments between experimental groups and control groups. Before conducting an experiment, the researchers will conduct an initial test to observe variable symptoms bound before being given stimulus. After the trial ends, the researchers will do their final test to compare the variable effect of the effect on the variable effect. From there, the causality between symptoms will be tested.

The general term is given to agents who disrupt normal physiology of animals or multicellular plants. But pathogens can also infect unicellular organisms of all biological kingdoms. Generally, only highly pathogenic organisms can cause disease, while the rest rarely cause disease. Pathogen opportunists are pathogens that rarely cause disease in people who have immunocompetent but who can cause serious disease/infectment in people who don't have immunodentized. This opportunist pathogen is generally a member of normal flora on the body. The term opportunist itself refers to the ability of an organism to take the opportunity given by the decline of the host's defense system to cause disease. Generally, all pathogens have been outside the body's cells at a certain range of time when they're exposed to antibody mechanisms, but when pathogens enter an intracellular phase that's not accessible to antibodies, T cells play their part. Virulence is a degree of pathogenity measured by the number of organisms needed to cause disease at a given time. Virulence is closely related to infections and diseases: infections refer to a situation in which a microrganism has settled and grown on a host, in which these microrganisms can hurt or not hurt its host; while disease is damage or injury to a host that interferes with the host's function. For example, 50% per 50% of the dose of dose (LD50) is the number of organisms required to kill half of the host population. While doses of infection 50%/ 50%infectious dose are the number of pathogens needed to infect 50% of the total host attack.",

The dose of infection from an organism depends on their virulence factor. The classification of pathogens is divided into: Viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa and worms. It's a parasite that's not a living creature, but it has a genetic material of nucleic acids that require the presence of a procariot or a living eukarith cell to do a replication or multiple of the nucleic acids. Viruses can infect animals, humans, plants, fungi, bacteria, protozoa, insects and almost all kinds of living things. An example of a virus that attacks bacteria is en:bacteriophage that attacks Escherichia coli. While human beings, for example, are the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) causing Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AlDS) disease. Bacteria included in procariot organisms other than having their uses can also cause harm because they are common pathogens in living things like humans. For example, the bacteria of the opportunist pseudomonas aeharinosa that can infect the lungs so that it can cause death. In addition to P. awearinosa another popular pathogen is Staphylococcus aureus which is a normal human microflora on the surface of the skin, mouth and nose, but by the time the immune system goes down, S. aureus will be pathogenic and can cause diseases such as clotting blood. Fungi is a procariot organism, which is part of the kingdom protista with about 75,000 already identified species, Fungi can be a parasite in humans, for example, like Candida albicans, which is an opportunist, which can cause infection in almost all parts of the human body and can cause death.

In the form of stereoisomer, monoskarides have at least one carbon asymmetric atom. Monoskarides form from the synthesis of simple compounds through the gluoneogenesis process. The formation of monoskarides can also be done through photosynthesis in certain plants and bacteria. In complex lipids, monoskarides are components of nucleic acids and important compounds. Some monoskarides have a sweet taste. The common nature of monoskarides is soluble water, colorless, and crystal solid. An example of monoskarides is glucose (destrosa), fructose (levulosa), galactose, xilosa and ribosa. A natural food ingredient that contains largely monoskarides in particular fructose and glucose is honey. Monosacreds are dyscharide - forming compounds (such as sucroses) and polycarides (such as cellulose and amylum). Monosacred is classified according to the number of carbon atoms it contains (triosa, tetrosa, pentosa, hexosa, and heptosa) and its active clusters, which can be an aldehida or keton. It then joins, being like aldohaexosa and ketotriosa. Next, each carbon atom that binds to a hydroxil cluster (except at both ends) is optical, thus producing several different carbohydrates even though the basic structure is the same. For example, galactose is aldohaxosa, but it has different properties of glucose because its atoms are composed differently. With some exceptions (e.g. deoksribosas), monoskarides have a common chemical formula Cx [H2O]y, where x is at least 3. Monoskarides can be grouped by the number of carbon atoms (or the number of x) contained: diosa (2) triosa (3) tetrosa (4), pentosa (5), hexosa (6), heptosa (7), and so on.

With some exceptions (e.g. deoxyribose or amino sugar), monoskarides have a common chemical formula: Monoskarides contain one of the ton function groups or aldehida. The general way to display the structure of the monoskaride cyclic is to use Haworth projections. It's usually used as a D.L. system. The monoskarides that contain the aldehida are classified as a sin, whereas those that contain the keton group are called ketose. Monoskarides can form through cellulose hydrolysis by the cellase enzymes, endoglucanase, exoglucanase, and a lobbyase. Endokklukanase plays a random hydrolysis in the cellulose amorph section. The result of hydrolysis is a lighter mass of molecules called cellodextrinstrins, a lobbyic, and glucose. Exoglucanase destroys the crystal - shaped cellulose structure and produces a cascade. Whereas the lobbyase converts the disaride into two molecules of simple sugar glucose that are the basis for the creation of ethanol. Sugar aren is formed from microbial invertage in sucrosa in the nira. The sugar content contained in the nira becomes a sucrosa reduction. This deduction is a monoskaride made up of a mixture of fructose and glucose. The process of sucrosa inversion took place just after the tapping of nira to nira was cooked into sugar. The fructose and glucose form through the acid hydrolysis process during the boiling of the sucrose solution.

He was Baladive's cousin, Kresna, and Subhadra. In the books of Mahabharata and Bhagawatapurana it is said that he is the sworn enemy of Kresna. Sisupala was killed by Kresna at the Rajasuya ceremony held by Judistira as a punishment for the sacrilege of humiliation. The Book of Bhagawatapurana explains that Sisupala is the composing of Jaya and Wijaya, the gatekeeper of Waikuntha, the palace of Vishnu. According to the Book of Mahabharata, Sisupala was born with three eyes and four arms. Her parents intended to throw it away, but the word from heaven prevented them from doing so because Sisupala was destined to live to adulthood. The Word says that the body of Sisupala can be normal if held in the lap by someone special, a Wisnu tyrant, and the death of Sisupala is also in the hands of the same person. When the Basudives went to see the Slutasrawa, Kresna was there. When Kresna held Sisupala, the eyes and extra arms on Sisupala disappeared. Knowing this, the parents of Sisupala realized that Sisupala's death was also in the hands of Kresna. When he grows up, they say, \"Lord, forgive us our sins.\" Kresna promised that she would endure her anger. He added: \"When Sisupala has insulted her more than 100 times, and the insult is done before the crowd, then Kresna promises that she will not hesitate to kill Sisupala. From childhood, Sisupala was educated by Jarasanda, King Magadha. He studied with Dantawaktra, and was taught to hate Kresna. When she reached adulthood, Sisupala and Dantawaktra grew up to be tough fighters. With the strength of those two young men, Jarasanda, who hated Kresna, tried to invade Mathura.",

Radionuclides can emit radiation like alpha particles, beta particles, or gamma rays. Radionuclides can be formed either naturally or deliberately by humans using nuclear reactors, particle accelerators, or radionuclide generators. The natural radionuklida is divided into three categories, which are the primordial radionuklida, and the cosmogenic radionuklida. In addition to being naturally formed, radionuclides can also form synthetically or artificially using nuclear reactors, particle accelerators, or radionuclide generators. For example, it's technetium-95 and promethium-146. Many of these were found in the assembly of secondhand fuels (nuclear). In the formation of radionuclides, nuclear reactors are best suited for the production of neutron-rich radioisotopes, such as molibdenum-99. Whereas cyclotrons are best suited to produce proton-rich radioisotopes, for example fluor-18. Some of the applications of radionuclides in various areas are : Industrial fields use radionuclides in various ways to increase productivity and in some cases, are used to obtain information that cannot be obtained in other ways. One example of its application is industrial tracers. Radioisotops are used by manufacturers as trackers to monitor fluid flow and filtration, measure engine wear or equipment corrosion, as well as to detect water pipes blocked or leak on oil pipes. Radiotracers are also used in oil and gas industries to help determine the size of oil fields.

They are also able to survive in the deepest depths of the ocean, compared with some other algae species. The red algae found in the deep seas are Gelidium and Gracicaria, while Euchema spinosum likes the shallow sea. Most colors in red algae vary depending on the depth of the ocean. Red algae would be black if they were in deep seas, light - red in a less deep sea, and green in shallow waters. The development of red algae is vegetative and geneative.

But according to modern scientific understanding, the weight of an object is caused by mass interaction with the gravitational field. For example, someone who lifts heavy objects on Earth can associate the weight of that object with its mass. This association is acceptable to things that are on Earth. But if it's on the Moon, then it's less weight and easier to lift, but it's still the same mass.

Scientists do not know exactly what determines one's sexual orientation, but they suspect that sexual orientation is triggered by a combination of genetic, hormone, and environment, and not an option. They refer to theories based on biology, which call genetic factors, early environments in the uterus, or both. There is no evidence that childhood experiences play a role in sexual orientation. Moreover, efforts to change sexual orientation are also not supported by scientific evidence.

Gay behavior is also widely observed in animals. Many gay and lesbian individuals have commitments to same-sex relationships, although there have only recently been censuses and legal/political status that make it easier to enumerate and exist. This relationship is equivalent to a heterosexual relationship in psychologically important matters. Homosexual relationships and acts have been admired, as well as condemned, throughout history, depending on the shape and culture in which they have been found. Since the end of the 19th century, there has been a movement toward recognition of the existence and legal rights of homosexuals, which includes the right to marriage and civil unity, the right to adoption and parenting, the right to employment, the right to military service, and the right to social health security. The homosexual word is a combination of Greek and Latin with the first elements derived from the Greek  very gays, 'equal' (unrelated to Latin gay words, 'human', as in Homo sapiens), so it can also mean sexual acts and affection between the same sex individuals, including lesbianism. Gays generally refer to male homosexuality, but they can be used widely to refer to all LGBT people. In the context of sexuality, lesbians only refer to female homosexuality.

But other plants can also grow on the land, because the competition in getting nutrients on the ground, the gain of sunlight, and the emergence of allelopatic substances, these other plants don't want its existence. Herbisides are used as one of the means to control weed. There are two types of herbicides according to the application: From the way herbicide works there are two types: Generally speaking, herbicides work by interfering with important compound anabolism processes such as starches, fatty acids, or amino acids through competition with normal compounds in the process. Herbisides become competitors because they have similar structures and become cosubstrates identified by enzymes that are targeted. Another way to do this is to disrupt the balance of the production of the chemicals that plants need. Example: A number of herbiside producers finance the production of transgenic plants that are resistant to herbicides. Thus, the use of herbicides can be expanded in the production plant. It can suppress production costs in large-scale agriculture with mechanization. Examples of herbicide resistant plants that have been developed are raps (canolas), corn, cotton, rice, potatoes, soybeans, and sugar beets. The use of herbicides reaps criticism because it spreads chemicals that are harmful to plants instead of targets. Although most of today's herbicides are harmless to humans and animals, the herbicides that are scattered (being carried by wind or carried by water) are potentially disrupting the growth of other plants. Hence, present - day herbicides are made to be easily unraveled by microorganisms in the ground or in the water.

The shell or foraminifera skeleton is a clue in the search for oil resources, natural gas and minerals. In some genus, the shell of the foraminifera is composed of kitin. Most of the foraminifers live in the sea, the majority live on the ocean floor (bentos), and some live on water (plankton). Some are known to live in fresh water waters, and some species are known to live in terrastrial and have been identified through molecular analysis of ribosomal DNA. Foraminifera generally produces a shell (test) that can consist of one space or more, and some have complex structures. The shell is generally made of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) or the ventriloquism particles. More than 50,000 species are known, with 10,000 living species and 40,000 of them fossilized. Foraminifera is generally less than 1 mm, but some are larger in size. The largest species of Foraminifera can reach to a size of up to 20 centimeters. The earliest references from the foraminifera are known to be from Herodotus, who in the 5th century B.C. recorded foraminifera as the rock maker who formed the Great Pyramid of Giza.

With unique foraminifera morphology, pseudopodia from the foraminifera is interpreted as tentacles and records no part of the head on the foraminifera because it has been reduced. He named foraminifer groups or \"hole-bearers\" as members of groups that have holes in the part between the complements in his shell, unlike the nautili or the ammonites. The protozoa of foraminifera was first recognized by Dujardin in 1835. In 1852, d'Orbigny made a classification scheme, with 72 genus foraminifera based on shell form (tests). This scheme reaps criticism from colleagues. In 1884, a monograph written by H.B. Brady described the discovery of foraminifera on the Challenger expedition. Brady wrote down 10 families with 29 subfamili, with little regard to the range of stratisography; the taxonomy that Brady compiled stressed emphasizes the idea that different characters should separate groups of taxonomy, and thus genus foraminiferinated (aglutinated) and calcareous (calcareous) are placed in close relations. This classification scheme remained until there was a scheme from Cushman in the late 1920s. Cushman saw the wall's composition as the most important trait in foraminifera classification. Cushman's classification was then widely polled, but it also reaped criticism from his colleagues because it was \"unsounding biological.\" Cushman's scheme remained the dominant classification scheme until Tappan and Loeblich's classification arose in 1964.

At first the wave had a small amplitude (umms of 20 inches) so it didn't feel in the open ocean, but its amplitude grew as it approached the coast. When it reaches shore, tsunamis sometimes hit the ground as a giant wall of water (especially at large tsunamis), but the more common shape is the sudden rise of the water surface. The rise of the water level can reach up to 50 feet, causing floods with current speeds up to 90 kilometers per hour, reaching a few kilometers from shore, and causing massive damage and loss of life. Because the most common tsunami is the underwater earthquake, especially what happens in the mining zone with a 7.0 power magnitudo scale moment or more.

Geographically, most tsunamis occur in the Pacific Fire Circle and in the Sumatra Trench in the Indian Ocean. Tsunami risk can be detected with an early tsunami warning system that observes large-powered earthquakes and perform data analysis on the changes in seawater that follow. If it is considered a tsunami risk, authorities can warn or take such measures as evacuations.

Yet, the term that was once popular was rejected by experts because this phenomenon had nothing to do with the tidal phenomena caused by the gravity of the sun and the moon. Experts prefer tsunami terms, although these phenomena are not limited to harbors. Some languages have an equivalent for tsunamis. For example, in Aceh, tsunamis are called i\u00eb beuna or al\u00f4n fur\u00ebl. The words smong and emong are used in languages on Simeulue Island, which is west of Sumatra Beach. In Tamil on the east coast of India, tsunamis are called aazhi peralai. Tsunamis can be triggered by disturbances on the ocean floor that cause large quantities of water to move. In the process of returning this disturbed water to the equilibrium or calm conditions, a wave can form and spread out leaving the center of the disturbance, causing a tsunami. Events that can cause this kind of water transfer include underwater earthquakes, avalanches that occur at the bottom of the ocean, falling into the water like a mountain eruption, meteors, or gunshots. The most common trigger is an earthquake that causes about 80% of the entire tsunami. The most potential earthquake is the earthquake that occurs in the mining zone (the meeting area of the two tablets that immerse one of the plates) shallow.

In Europe, not many politicians or parties describe themselves as \"populists.\" The general framework of populism is known as an ideal approach: It defines populism as a flexible procedural ideology (a thin-centered ideology) which emphasizes a sharp division between moral raspangs\" and the corrupt commitment of Laodicea, those who are often associated as a group of bullies, greedy, always self-serving, and ignoring the will of the masses. In other words, populism is born on the basis of the common people's perception of elite betrayal or counterdictive political attitude that behaves counterdictively between political pledges during his campaign and realization in his time of power. This approach has three basic elements in populism, which is the people, the elite, and the will of the betrayed people. According to the ideal approach, populism is often combined with other ideologies, such as nationalism, liberalism, or socialism. Thus, populists can be found in different locations along the left-right political spectrum, and there is left - wing populism and right - wing populism. The discursive approach emphasizes populism as a political construction of the union of charges or homogeneous aspirations of heterogenous society. This community's aspirations cotomy between \"the people's demands\" ignored by an unresponsive elite of rulers. These demands are tied together by the fact that narratives between people form a collective political agenda. On the other hand, the multiclass or structural political economy, according to Vedi Hadiz and Richard Robinson, emphasizes this approach to social and material bases that come from cross class to populism related to conflict over power and resources in certain historical contexts.",

The grouping of who is worthy is defined as the \u0392ragi, the \"elite,\" or \"assing,\" is determined based on his political identity. The use of the word \"populists\" in populic rhetoric tends to be ambiguous because it is interpreted by the imagination of populis forts as the unity of moral society located at a specific location or group called heartland. Generally, the meaning of populistic \"populists\" we can refer to as the majority voters, especially \u25aasilent majority or the majority group of disappointed and saturated conditions of life is feeling increasingly difficult as their aspirations in the crucial policies created by the dominant and elite politicians in power. The majority voter, however, is somewhat less involved in the political process but has a huge expectation of democratic output. At this point, the disappointment of voters to political elites has become vulnerable to populistic political politics. Populists will use the majority's anxiety as momentum to build symbolic connections and social support in order to gain vote support through naming political vision identity, threat perception, and reprieve of different differences. In that way, populists will present themselves as a new hope for people's aspirations without having to bother in political participation and complex democratic mechanisms. And so, heartland is important to know in order to identify the pockets of populic constituents, whether on the basis of ethnic or religious identity, ideology, demographic characteristics, political culture, and economic social conditions.",

Before the city of Shanghai, Shanghai was part of Songjiang's city that was regulated by the province of Suzhou. This town was formed about 1000 years ago. Since the reign of the Song Dynasty (960-1279), Shanghai has gradually developed into a busy harbor. The city of Shanghai began to be built since the city walls were built in 1553 B.C.E.

Taiping's rebellion broke out in 1850, and Shanghai was ruled by a fragment group of rebels called the Small Sword-Swords Association. The dispute destroyed the suburbs but did not touch foreign occupations until the Chinese fled and sought refuge there. Although Chinese society was forbidden to live in foreign occupied areas, new rules made in 1854 allowed Chinese people to have it and thus the price of land soared. The year was also the first meeting of the Shanghai City Trust, which was helped to govern foreign lands. Britain and America are united in 1863 to form an international occupational area. The war between China-Japanese (1894-1895) for power over Korea ended with the Shimonoseki Treaty, where Japan rose as Shanghai's new foreign ruler. Japan set up its first plant in Shanghai that was soon followed by other foreign rulers to stir up industrial activity there. Shanghai at that time was the largest financial center in East Asia.

Most of these bacteria are common and harmless to health. In humans, these bacteria can be found in vaginas and digestive systems, where they are symbiotic and are a fraction of the intestinal flora. Many species of Lactobacillus have the ability to decomposition excellent plant matter. The production of lactic acid makes the environment acidic and disrupts the growth of some bacteria. Some of these members of the genus already have their own genome.

The only reality is matter and everything is a manifestation of material activity. Its material and activity are eternal. No first drive or first cause. No life, no eternal mind.

Neurons are usually grouped into three types based on their function. Sensoric neurons respond to stimuli like touch, sound, or light that affects sensoric organ cells, and they send signals to spinal cord or brain marrow. The motor neurons receive signals from the brain and spinal marrow to control everything from muscle contractions to gland secretions. Interneuron connects neurons to other neurons in the same area of the brain or spinal marrow. When some neurons connect together, they form what's called a neural circuit. Each neuron consists of one cell body inside which is cytoplasm and the nucleus of the cell. From the cell body comes out two different nerve fibers, which are dendrite and axon. Dendrite sends impulses to the nerve cell body, while the axon acts to transmit impulses from the cell body to other nerve cells or to other tissues. If the dendrite knot is damaged, then the person has a nervous breakdown. If it happens in other organs, then it becomes numb. Akson is usually very long. On the contrary, the dendrite is short. At the end of the axon there's a synapse which is a gap between the nerve endings in which the neurotransmitters are released to transmit impulses to the next nerve or the organs that are intended.

He provided shelter for Pandavas living under cover for a year, after they had spent 12 years in exile in the forest. Wirata came from the Matsya Dynasty and founded a new kingdom called the Wirata Kingdom. King Wirata had three sons named North, Sweta and Sangka. He participated in the great war in Kurukshetra and sided with Pandawa. In battle, he and all his sons were killed by Korawa's knights.

It occurs when the atmosphere (which is a giant gas solution) becomes saturated and water then condenses and comes out of the solution (precipated). The air becomes saturated through two processes, cooling or adding water vapor. Precipitation that reaches the earth's surface can be a number of forms, including rain, freezing rain, shower, snow, sleet, and hail. Virga is a precipitation that originally fell to Earth but evaporated before reaching its surface. Precipitation is an important component in the water cycle and is the source of most fresh water on Earth. About 505,000 km3 water drops through the precipitation process each year, as much as 398,000 km3 drops in the ocean. If it's based on the vastness of the Earth's surface, global annual precipitation is about 1 m, and the annual precipitation of the oceans is about 1.1 m. Precipitation needs to be measured to get a very useful rain data for hydrological planning, as much as planning the building of dams, and so on. The mechanism of precipitation is divided into three, that is, connective rain, stratiform, and orographic rain. The connective process is caused by a steam column that evaporates and experiences a drop in temperature. This process involves rapid vertical movement and leads to high rainfall at a specific location. The magnitude of the connective precipitation depends on how much warming is happening on the surface, the amount of water in the atmosphere, and the amount of environmental temperature difference in height. Precipitation through a stratification process involves a slower vertical movement and leads to lower rainfall than the convection process. Meanwhile, orographic precipitation involves vertical movements in the atmosphere that are influenced by the topography of the region.",

Liquid - shaped Precipitation can be rain and drizzle. The rain that freezes when it touches the mass of the cold air is called \"the freezing rain.\" Solid precipitation can be snow, diamond dust, hail, and graupel. These three categories of precipitation can go down together as mixed precipitation. Coalesence occurs when droplets merge into larger drops of water or when droplets freeze into ice crystals, known as the Bergeron process. The rate of falling from tiny droplets of water is so insignificant that clouds do not fall from the sky. When turbulence occurs, water drops collide until they form larger drops of water. When large droplets start falling from the clouds, the coalesence process continues until the droplets of water become large enough to be able to resist the resistance of the wind and fall as rain. Rainwater drops are about an inch [0.1 mm] in diameter to an inch [9 mm]. Larger drops of rain than that tend to break into smaller drops. Small droplets are commonly called cloud drops and are round. When those droplets grow, they become more oval. Unlike what is normally described in cartoons, the real form of rainwater does not resemble teardrops. Rain intensity usually compares inversely to its duration. High - intensity storms are generally short - rated. On the other hand, storms with small intensity generally vary in length. The METAR code for long rain (rain) is RA, while the code for rain is brief and clear the limit is SH.

Symbiosis can be an obligatory thing, which means one or two symbions depend entirely on each other to survive, or facultative (optional) when they can generally live on their own. Symbiosis is also classified on the basis of physical attachment; the symbiosis of organisms that have a body/organal union is called conjunctive symbiosis, and the symbiosis in which they are not united is called disjungtive symbiotic symbiosis. When one organism lives in another organism, it's called endosymbiosis.

In 1879, German mycologist Heinrich Anton de Bary defined it as \"a different organism that lives together.\" These definitions vary among scientists with some encouragement that symbiosis refers only to persistent mutualism, while others think that symbiosis should be applied to all kinds of persistent biological interactions, in other words including mutualistic, comensalism, or parasite.",

After 130 years of debate, biology and ecological textbooks today use the last de Bary definition or a broader definition of symbiosis, which means all species interactions, and a narrow definition of symbiosis which means just a mutual relationship is no longer used. Symbiotic relationships can become obligates, which means that one or two symbions depend entirely on each other for survival. For example, on liken, which consists of fungal symbion and symbiones that can photosynthesis, his mushroom partner cannot live on his own. Symbion algae or phenobacterials in moss, such as Trentepohlia, can generally live on their own, therefore the symbiosis is a facultative (optional). For example, it includes a variety of microbiomas, rhizobia, nitrogen binding bacteria that live in a root nodules on legume; an actinycete of nitrogen binding bacteria called Frankia, which live in an alder root nodules; a single alga cell within coral reef buildings; and endosymbion bacteria that provide important nutrients about 9% -10% to insects. There are some symbiotic forms: Parasites are one of the interactions between two organisms that benefit one organism and the other are wronged. Example: Mutualism is one of two things that benefits one another.

The regular intercity bus service with steam-powered buses was pioneered in England in the 1830s by Walter Hancock and by a colleague of Sir Goldsworthy Gurney, among other things, running a reliable service to road conditions too dangerous for horse transport. The mechanically driven Omnibus first appeared on the streets of London on April 22, 1833.

Because these fractions are the size of quantity per quantity, they're a pure number without a corresponding unit of measurements. What is commonly used is parts per million (parts-per-million, ppm, 10,6), parts per billion (parts-per-billion, ppb, 10,9), parts per trillion (parts-per-trillion, ppt, 1012) and parts per kudrillion (parts-per-quadrillion, ppq, 10,15). This notation is not part of the International Unit (SI) system, and its understanding is still ambiguous. Parts per notation is often used to describe a diluted solution in chemistry, for example, the relative abundance of dissolved minerals or pollutants in water. The quantity of \"1 ppm\" can be used for mass fractions if water - carried pollutants are found in a millionth of a gram per gram of sample solution. When dealing with water solution, it's usually assumed that the mass of water is 1.000 g/mL. It is therefore common to compare 1 kilogram [1 kg] of water to 1 L of water. As a result, 1 ppm corresponds to 1 mg/L and 1 ppb according to 1 g/L. Similarly, section per notation is also used in physics and techniques to express the value of proportional phenomena. For example, special metal alloys can expand 1.2 micrometers per meter long for every degree Celsius and this will be described as \"1.2 ppm/\u00b0C.\" Parts per notation is also used to indicate change, stability, or uncertainty in measurements. For example, the accuracy of surveying distances when using laser distance gauges may be one millimeter per kilometer per kilometer; this can be described as \"accuracy = 1 ppm.\" Part per notation is all nondimensional quantity: in mathematical expression, unit measurements always cancel.",

When part notation per, including the percent symbol (%), is used in regular prose (as opposed to mathematical expression), they are still pure nondimensional quantity of numbers. However, they generally take the literal meaning of the \"part by\" of the comparative ratio (e.g. \"2 ppb\" will generally be interpreted as \"two parts in a billion parts\"). Section per notation can be specified in the same size unit. For example, the expansion coefficient of certain brass alloys, \u25aa = 18.7 ppm/\u00b0C, can be expressed as 18.7, or as 18.7, the numeric value that represents relative proportions do not change with the application of different long units. Similarly, measuring pumps that inject chemicals into the main process line at the rate of the Qp proportional flow = 125 ppm, do it at a rate that can be expressed in various volumetric units, including 125 \u25aaL/L, 125 gal/gal, 125 cm3/m3, etc. In the spectroscopy of the magnetic resonance of the nucleus (nuclear magnetic resonance, NMR), chemical shift is usually expressed in the ppm. It represents a frequency difference measured in parts per million of the reference frequency. The frequency of reference depends on the magnetic field of instruments and measured elements. It's usually in MHz. Typical chemical shift is rarely more than a few hundred Hz from reference frequencies, so chemical shift is easily expressed in ppm (Hz/MHz). Parts notation per gives a nirdimensional quantity that doesn't depend on the force of the instrument field.

Chile has a coastline of 6,435 miles long, while its Pacific coastline is 78,563.2 kilometers long. The climate in Chile varies, ranging from the driest desert climate of the world (The Atacama Teacher) in the north, through the Mediterranean Climate in the middle, to the rain in the south. According to the area of the land, Chile is one of the world's 38th state categories, which is about the same size as Kalimantan Island. The northern desert contains an abundance of mineral wealth, mainly copper. The relatively narrow central region of this country dominates in terms of population and agricultural resources, and is the cultural and political center of Chile's expansion at the end of the 19th century, when it absorbs northern and southern regions. Southern Chile is rich in forests and meadows, and there are some volcanoes and lakes. The southern seaboard is a maze of fjords, niches, canals, winding peninsulas, and island systems. Before the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century, northern Chile was under the rule of the Inca Kingdom, while the natives of Mapuche inhabited central and southern Chile. Chile declared its independence from Spain on February 12, 1818. In the Pacific War (1879 JULI 1883), Chile defeated Peru and Bolivia and won the northern territory.",

        "paragraph": "Alkena or olephine in organic chemistry is an unsatisfied hydrocarbon with a double bond between carbon atoms. Alkena and olefin terms are often used in turns (see the part of the Tata name below). The simplest alkena fungalik, which forms a skeleton bond and does not bond with any functional group, known as mono-ena, forms a series of hydrocarbon homologics with the general CnH2n formula. Alkena has a lack of two hydrogen atoms compared to related alcana (with the same number of carbon atoms). The simplest alkena is ethena or ethylene (C2H4), the largest organic compound produced on an industrial scale. The aromatic compounds are often described as cyclic alkena, but their structures and features are different so they are not considered to be alkena. Like a single covalent bond, the skeleton bond can be described in the overlapping shape of an atom orbital, except that, unlike a single bond (conclude a single sigma bond), the carbon condensation of the firmabond is composed of one sigma bond and one pi bond. This bond is stronger than a single covalent bond (611 kJ/mol for C=C vs 347 kJ/mol for C\u25aaC) and also shorter, with an average bond length of 1.33 htr\u00f6m (133 pm). Each carbon in the bonds uses three sp2 hybrid orbits to form a sigma bond to three atoms (one carbon and two hydrogen atoms). The 2p atom orbital which does not form a hybrid, which is perpendicular to a field made by the three-orbital axis of the sp2 hybrid, joins to form a pi bond. This bond is outside the main axis of C\u25efC, with half the bond on one side of the molecule and half the one on the other. Rotation around the carbon skeleton bond is limited because it requires a great amount of energy to sever the p orbital alignment on two carbon atoms.",

        "paragraph": "As a consequence, substitutional alkena is found as one of two isomers, called cis or trans isomers. The more complex alkena can be named after the E\u25efZ notation for molecules with three or four different substitutions. For example, isomer butena, two groups of metil (Z)-but-2-ena (alia cis-2-butena) appear on the same side of the skeleton bond, and on the (E)-but-2-ena (Alalia trans-2-butena) group of methyls appears on the opposite side. These two butena is slightly different in its chemical and physical properties. A 90\u00b0 spin of the C=C (which can be determined by the position of a carbon-bound cluster of functions) requires less energy than the force of the pi bond, so that the bond can survive. It contradicts the common statement on the textbook that the p orbital will not be able to maintain that kind of bond. In fact, p orbital deviations are less than expected because of pyramidization (see: pyramidal alkena). The trans-Siklooktena is a stable straight alkena and orbital deviation with only 19\u00b0 dihedral angles 137\u00b0 (normal 120\u00b0) and an 18\u00b0 pyramidal level. Isomer trans sycloheptena is only stable at low temperature. As predicted by the repulsion model of the VSEPR electron pairs, the geometry of the alkena molecule covers the angle of the bond around each of the carbons in a cluster bond range of 120\u00b0. Angles vary because the iron chain is influenced by unbounded interactions between clusters of functions bound to carbon bonds. For example, the angle of the C-C-C bond in propylene is 123.9\u00b0. For a bridge alkena, Bredt's rule states that the bond cannot occur at the base of the bridge of the ring system unless the ring is large enough (8 or more atoms). The nature of alkena physics is no different from that of alkana. They are colorless, nonpolar, flammable, and almost odorless.",

The famous formula in calculus development, where derivatives from the beginning are considered to be the ratio of two quantitys at the Infinitesimal. This definition, like most mathematics of the time, is not formalized in a very strict way. As a result, the next formal treatment of calculus tends to drop a very small point of view that supports the value of the limit, which can be done using real standard.

The insight by exploiting the infinitesimal is that the entity can still maintain certain specific properties, such as angles or slopes, although the entity is very small. The word of infinitesimal comes from the modern Latin currency of the 17th century infinitesim, which originally refers to the \"infinite to\" item. Infinitesimally is the basis for an Infinitesimal calculus procedure like that developed by Gottfried Leibniz, including the laws of continuity and the laws of transcendental homogenity.

The concept of infinitesimals was originally introduced about 1670 by Nicolaus Mercator or Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz.

In the official tract published, Archimedes solved the same problem using a method of completion.

Feathers are the most complex structure on Vertebrata. Like hair, nails and scales, feathers are additional integumenters; skin organs formed from the controlled breeding of biological cells in epidermis, or outer skin, that produce ape protein. It protects birds from water and cool temperatures and gives color that is sometimes used as a disguise from predators and sometimes as a means of visual communication. Although each feather is light, the feathers weigh two to three times more than the bone. It is estimated that feathers change from reptilian scales, however recent studies raise doubts about this homology (for further reading of Q Rev Biol. 2002 Sep;77:3:261-95.). The feather may be a philinescent purveyor structure, or possibly a clouding marker, and this later changes to the latest feather. Although birds use flamer feathers to fly, some dinosaurs have been found with feathers on their limbs that are impossible to fly. One theory is that this feather develops on dinosaurs as a means of healing; the little dinosaur then produces longer feathers that helps them to glide, which then begins the process of evolution that produces the protogene Archaeopteryx and Microraptor. Most birds have two basic feathers: the outer plumae (plume, plumae) that are structured to be curled and visible from the outside and the inner feathers (plutural, plural ~-e) that are inside the outer fur layer and unstructured.

Clouds are studied in cloud science or cloud physics, a branch of meteorology. On Earth substance is usually precipitation of water vapor.

Until the point where those droplets will keep falling down and the rain will come down. If those water dots meet hot air, those dots will evaporate and the clouds will disappear. This is what's causing those clouds to change their shape all the time. The water contained within the cloud is constantly evaporating and melting. This is also what causes sometimes clouds that don't bring rain. Clouds are classified by the height and appearance of the soil. The roots and translations of the cloud summarize the classification system: 1) Cirro-: hair curl 2) Alto-: middle 3) Strato-: 4) Nimbo-: rain, precipitation 5) Cumulo -: A high cloud pile occurs above about 20,000 feet and is given a prefix '\"cirro-.\" Because of this level's cold troposphere temperature, clouds consist primarily of ice crystals, and often appear thin, striped, and white (even though the low angle of the sun, such as the setting sun, can create a pattern of colors in the clouds). Three major types of high cloud are Sirus (Cirrus), Sirostratus (Cirrostratus), and Sirokumulus (Cirrocumulus). The thin, furry cloud is composed entirely of ice crystals.

Intellectual ability is the ability needed to perform various mental activity - thinking, reasoning, and solving problems. Individuals in most societies place intelligence, and for the right reasons, at high value. Intelligent individuals are also more likely to be leaders in a group. The seven most often mentioned dimensions that make up intellectual abilities are: physical abilities are tasks that require stamina, skill, strength, and similar characteristics. Studies on the requirements required in hundreds of jobs have identified the nine basic abilities involved in the performance of physical tasks. Each individual has these basic abilities differently. Certain intellectual or physical abilities needed to do adequate work depend on the requirements of those abilities and jobs. For example, aircraft pilots require strong spatial visualization; coastal guards need strong spatial visualization and good body coordination; senior executives need verbal abilities; and high construction workers need balance. Biographic characteristics are characteristics of individuality - such as age, gender, race, and term - that are easily and objectively obtained from one's personal archives. Relationships between age and performance are likely to be a more important issue over the next decade because there is a broad belief that work performance declines with age; the fact that the work force is aging; and legislation, especially in the U.S., which prohibits retirement orders. Evidence indicates that the best place to start is with the recognition that there are few, if any, significant differences between men and women who influence their performance.",

There is an implied principle in inductive reasoning, which is the assumption of the course of nature and the order of the universe; what happens once, will happen again in proportion to sufficient circumstances, as often as the same situation repeats itself. This assumption applies to any inductive reasoning. The basis of thinking patterns is observation, knowledge acquired from this observation that then becomes special knowledge. Observation precedes induction. Generalization is a statement that contains characters for all or most of the objects being investigated. Generalization includes inductive reasoning that has a probability truth based on information from several objects. Generalization is the opposite process of reasoning from a number of individual phenomena to a general conclusion that binds all kinds of phenomena to individual phenomena that are investigated.

By evening's end, Arjuna hasn't reached Jayadrata and killed her, and if after nightfall Arjuna hasn't succeeded in killing Jayadrata then she will burn herself. Kresna who saw Arjuna in trouble tried to help her by making a simultaneous solar eclipse. When it gets dark, the fighting parties feel that the war of that day is over because the night has arrived. Korawa's army protecting Jayadrata returned to their camp. By the time Jayadrata was unprotected, the sun had resurfaced and it hadn't turned out to be night yet. On that occasion, Arjuna told Kresna to reach Jayadrata. As he approached, he opened his arrows and severed Jayadrata's neck with a Pasupati magic weapon. On Kresna's advice, Arjuna directed the weapon to carry Jayadrata's head onto her father's meditated Wredaksatra's lap. Before the war began, Wredaksatra granted that whoever made his son's head hit the ground, the man's head would explode into a hundred pieces. When the child's head fell on his lap, Wredasatra was shocked, and then accidentally dropped the head. That caused his head to burst into pieces. In Aswamedikaparwa's book it is told that after the war ended, Arjuna fought with Sindhu's forces when they refused to acknowledge the Justinistira as the world's maharaja. When Dursala, Jayadrata's wife, came out to protect her son, the young heir to Sindhu's throne, Arjuna stopped fighting. Between Jayadrata's story in the Mahabharata and Javanese tradition, it's quite different, but it's not too big because the core of the story is the same.",

It means \"es.\" Glaciers are the largest freshwater reserves on Earth. Glaciers can also form from cold water from winter, and then when high temperatures of glaciers melt away so that they become fresh water sources for living things. Because glacial mass is influenced by long-term climate changes, for example, rainfall, average temperatures, and clouds, glacial mass change is considered one of the most sensitive indicators of climate change and is a major source of sea level variation. Although many people think that glaciers are always in the polar regions, they can actually be in high mountain areas across the continent, except Australia, even in the high mountains near the equator. The large lump of blue glaciers is due to the size of the quantity of water that accumulates in glaciers. Because water molecules are very good at absorbing different colors except blue. Another reason, because the air bubble content in the glacier is less. There are several types of glaciers, including Piedmont glaciers and polar glaciers. The Piedmont glacier is a fan or lobe, located in front of the mountains. Piedmont glaciers form when one or more glacier valley flows from the valley to the plains with floating styles.",

Fractal geometry is a branch of mathematics that studies the properties and behaviors of fractures.

At present, the large areas grown in radishes are the high plains of Panga's arms, Pacet, Cigar, and Bedugul. The area of the radish plant in Indonesia is currently about 5,700 acres [15,700 ha]. The good soil for the turnip is the ground, the soil is ground, the top layer of the ground with no pebbles, and the acidity of the soil is 5-6. The right planting time is during the rainy season or early dry season. For planting in the dry season, plants must be quite water. The nutrients, folic acid, vitamin C, calcium, and potassium content make radishes increasingly desirable because they can increase the body's year and a host of other benefits. The radish is grown from its seeds. Radish seeds do not need to be brought from abroad (import), simply from their own seeds because they are flowery and seedy. The seeds can be planted directly in the garden without being caressed first. For a 1 ha planting plant, a 5 kg seed is required. The theory is that for a land of 1 ha it takes 4 kg of seeds with 75% sprout power. Before the seeds are planted, the land that will be cultivated first is held in a 40 - inch - deep hold, and then it's fertilized or composted 10 tons /ha. Once the ground is flattened, it's grooved at a distance between 30 centimeters. It would be wise to stretch the plot from west to east to allow sunlight to enter the plant to the maximum. The seeds are then sown thinly along the groove, then they're covered with thin, thin soil.",

Some civil engineers define the tunnel as a breach below the surface that has a minimum length of 150 meters, and a shorter one than that deserves to be called underpass. Tunnels are usually used for vehicle traffic (common cars or trains) as well as for pedestrians or cyclists. In addition, there are tunnels that provide water to reduce floods or to be consumed, sewer tunnels, power plants, and tunnels that channel telecommunication cables. There are also tunnels that serve as roads for animals, generally intended for rare animals whose habitats are crossed by highways. Some secret tunnels have also been created as a method for access to or exiting a safe or dangerous place, such as a tunnel in the Gaza Strip, and the Cu Chi Tunnel in Vietnam that was built and used in Vietnam. In Britain, underground tunnels for pedestrians or transportation are commonly called subways. This term is used in the past, and today it's more popular called the Underground Rapid Transit System. Tunnels were made through different types and layers of soil and rock so that construction methods depended on soil conditions. This is the simplest method for a shallow tunnel where the area above the site to which the tunnel should be dug and the tunnel built with the roof above it. After that, the area was relocked to look like it was before it was dug up.

Most humans live in a social structure made up of certain groups that in turn can compete or help each other from small family groups to large political groups or countries. Human social interactions create diversity of values, norms, and rituals in human society. Man's desire to know and influence his surroundings resulted in developments in philosophy, science, mythology, and religion. Another class is based on age, starting with fetuses, infants, toddlers, children, teenagers, pinscotch, young men, adults, and parents.

Anaphylaxis is usually indicated by some symptoms including itchy rashes, swelling throats, dyspnea, vomiting, fainting dizziness, and low blood pressure. These symptoms will occur within minutes of the hour. The common causes of this reaction are insect bites, food, and medicine. Other causes can be latex exposure. Moreover, cases can happen for no apparent reason. The anaphylaxistic mechanism involves the release of mediators from certain white blood cells. The release of this protein can be caused by the reaction of the immune system or by other causes that have nothing to do with the immune system. Anaphylaxis is performed based on symptoms and signs on someone after exposure to potential allergens. The early anaphylaxis was the giving of epinephrine injections, the installation of IVs, and the horizontal positioning of the body. Additional epinephrine doses can be administered if necessary. Carrying automatic epinephrine injectors and identifying marks on medical conditions are recommended for people who have anaphylaxis history. Around the world, about 0.05:02% of the population has experienced anaphylaxis at some point in its life. These numbers seem to be increasing. Anaphylaxis is more common among teenagers and women. This term comes from the ancient Greek: ana which means \"against\" and phylaxis which means \"detainment.\" Anaphylaxis usually gives different symptoms within minutes or hours. Symptoms will appear in an average of 5 to 30 minutes if the cause is a substance that enters the bloodstream directly and an average of 2 hours if the cause is food consumed by the person.

Other symptoms that can arise are watery noses and conjunctive swelling. Skin can become bluish as a result of lack of oxygen. Symptoms of the respiratory system include dyspnea, instigation, or stridor. It's usually caused by the spasme in the muscles that make up the bronchus. Stridor comes from swelling that causes narrowing in the upper air duct. A hoarse sound, swallowing pain, or coughing can also occur. Spasme at the coroner's artery can be accompanied by myocardium infarctions, heart rhythm disorders, or heart stops. Sufferers with a history of heart disease have a greater risk of having an anaphylaxis effect on the heart. Spasme coroner arteries have to do with the release of histamine by certain cells in the heart. While heart rate is more common as a result of low blood pressure, 10% of people with anaphylaxis can have a slow heart rate due to low blood pressure. The combination between slow heart rate and low blood pressure is known as the Bezold Journal reflex. Sufferers can feel a headache or even lose consciousness because of a drop in blood pressure. This drop in blood pressure is caused by shock. In rare cases, very low blood pressure can be the only sign of anaphylaxis. Symptoms in the stomach and intestines can be a pain in the stomach (lass), diarrhea, and vomiting.

This name translates as \"the city of victory\" or \"the city of glory.\" But it really means \"victory achieved by a deed or effort\" because it comes from the two Sanskrit words Jaya means \"victory\" and Karta means \"appreciated.\"",

According to Portuguese sources, Sundan Calapa is one of the ports owned by the Sundan Kingdom besides Banten, Potang, Cigede, Tamgara and Cimanuk. The kalada Kalapa in this text is considered the most important port because it can be taken from the royal capital called Dayo (in modern Sundana: dayeuh which means \"the capital\") within two days. The Sunda Kingdom itself was a continuation of the Tarumanagara Empire in the 5th century, so this port has been thought to have existed since the 5th century and is thought to be the capital of Tarumanala, called Sundapura (Sanskrit meaning \"Sunda\"). In the 12th century, this port was known as a busy port of pepper. Foreign ships from China, Japan, South India, and the Middle East have already docked in these ports carrying such items as porcelain, coffee, silk, fabrics, perfumes, horses, wine, and dyes in exchange for the spices that were trade commodities of the day.",

        "paragraph": "In fertilizing plants, roots are plant organs that play an important role in holding down vegetation and absorbing water and nutrients into the plant's body, which enable plants to grow higher and faster. Roots often lie below the surface of the ground, but roots can also be modified and specialized. For example, air roots or aerial roots, these types of roots usually grow on the ground or especially on the water. Roots play an important role in the absorption of water and nutrients of vegetation and as a support for vegetation on the ground. Root morphology is divided into four zones: root hoods, crystalmic meristems, extension zones, and root hairs. The root hood helps new roots penetrate the ground. These root hoods are removed when deeper roots create slimy surfaces that provide lubricant. The apical meristem behind the root cover produces a new elongated root cell. The root hair will then form, which root hair absorbs water and mineral nutrients from the soil. The first root of seedy vegetation is called radicle, which develops from embryonic vegetation after seed sprouts. When dissected, the cell arrangement inside the root is root hair, epidermis, epiblems, cortex, endodermis, pericle and, finally, the vascular tissue in the middle of the root to transport water absorbed by the roots to another part of the plant. Needs clarification] in response to nutrients concentration, roots also synthesize cytokin, which acts as a signal of growth. Roots often serve as food and nutrients storage. The roots of most vascular plant species are symbiotic with certain mushrooms to form micoriza. A large number of other organisms, including bacteria, often live in roots. Fossil traces of the Essian root, or rather, holes filled with the decaying remains of the root of Tirzah could have been removed from the end of the Silurian period, some 430 million years ago.",

        "paragraph": "Root identification tends to be difficult, since root fossil molds are very similar to animal burrows. Root fossils can be distinguished using various features. The development of the root evolutionary is likely to occur from the shallow bane (modified horizontal trunk) that sustains primitive vase plants. This primitive root then develops in the form of fibrous rhymang (called rizoid) that sustains vegetation and transports water to plants from the soil. The early growth of the root is one function of the apical meristem located near the root tip. The meristem cells continue to split in a little bit, resulting in more meristem, root hood cells (sacrificed to protect meristem), and undiffered root cells. These cells then become the primary root network, after they've previously been in proboscising, a process that pushes the root end into the growing media. Gradually these cells are differentified and matured into the special cells of the root tissue. The distribution of vascular plant roots in the soil depends on the form of plants, the providing of water and nutrients spatially and temporally, as well as the physical properties of soil. Deepest roots are generally found in deserts and temperate coniferous types of forests. Roots grow shallowest in tundra, boreal forests, and temperate meadows. Deepest living roots observed, at least 60 feet [60 m] below ground level, are observed during opencut mines in Arizona, U.S.A. Some roots can grow into the ground as high as the tree. The majority of the roots on most plants are found relatively close to the surface of the soil, where nutrients and aeracy are better for growth.

Inclination was commonly used in astronomical fields that became one of the six orbital parameters in Kepler's element of existence, semimayor actions, inclination, and so on, all depicting the shape and orientation of the celestial body. Inclination can be said to be the distance between the plane of planetary orbits to the field of reference (ummation of earth, sun, or even Jupiter) expressed by degrees. A common reference field is the earth's equitator where more observation is done on earth. Most of the orbits of the planets in the solar system have a tiny inclination of the Sun as a result of the formation of this solar system and the interconnected relationship with each other.

This movement is therefore also called the Radical Reformation group. This church began with a former Catholic priest named Menno Simons from the Netherlands. Menno Simons was born in the city of Witmarsum in Friesland in 1496, and died in 1561. Simons was prepared from his youth to become a Catholic priest and dedicated in 1524.

But Simons never read the Bible, despite his education and training to read and write Latin in his convent. Simons deliberately avoided the Bible out of fear. As a Catholic, he was taught that only the Pope could interpret the Bible without error. In the first year of his ministry as a priest, Simons began to doubt the teachings of the infallibility of the pope, at the time he led the mass.

But the deeper he read and studied the Bible, the more convinced he became that it had no Scriptural basis.

At that point Simons discovered Martin Luther's writings and based on them, he finally acknowledged that the Word of God was more authoritative than the commandments and practices of man. Luther firmly taught that the laws of man cannot be condemned forever. Humans neither give gifts nor remove them. Hence slowly Simons got rid of the doctrine of transubstantiation, although he kept the sacrament at mass. Simons ' experience did not make him leave the Catholic Church.

Although human migration has lasted for thousands of years, the modern concept of immigration, particularly in the 19th century, is related to the development of nations with clear citizenship criteria, passports, permanent border surveillance, and citizenship laws. The citizenship of a country gives its citizens special rights, while immigrants are restricted by immigration laws. The nations are making immigration into a political issue; per definition it is the homeland of a nation marked by ethnic and/or cultural similarities, whereas immigrants have different ethnicities and cultures. This sometimes leads to social tensions, xenophobia, and national identity conversions in many developed countries. There are also members of Immigration, or Immigration Officers/offices who are in every place in international arrivals and departures. Immigration Members' task is to guard and carry out the task of overseeing the arrival and departure of a citizen by seeing the identity of the person who will travel abroad.

Surau occupied a separate building instead of a room on a building. The surau functions are almost the same as mosques as the center of community religious activities and basic education in Islam. However, since the building is relatively smaller than the mosque, the surau is not usually used for the implementation of Friday and Ied. In the minangbau, the surau is mostly reserved as an educational institution because it's located next to the mosque. The term surau was well - known in Minrakebau long before the arrival of Islam. A.A. Navis describes a surau as a place for boys who have grown up to sleep at night. This function did not change after the arrival of Islam, but expanded into a place of worship and the spread of Islamic science. According to Islamic scholar Azyumardi Azra, the surau position in Minaranbau is similar to that of the kastren in Java. However, after the independence of the surau's existence in Minangangbau subsided because Islamic educational institutions in Indonesia had to submit to government rules. In Malaysia, the difference in function between a surau and a mosque is not very clear. For administrative purposes, the suraus are distinguished into large surfers and small surfers. Although its function is almost the same as that of a mosque in Indonesia, large surfers usually have a more complete religious function. However, large surfers are not generally referred to as Islamic educational institutions. On the other hand, small seals are usually also enabled to provide basic religious lessons.

This term is commonly used in the context of human interest in expressing romantic or sexual feelings toward both men and women at once. The term is also defined as covering romantic or sexual interest in all gender identities or in a person regardless of the gender or biological gender of that person, which is sometimes called pansexuality. Bisexuality is one of the three major classifications of sexual orientation, along with heterosexuality and homosexuality, each of which is part of a series of heterosexual-homosexual heterosexual unions. A bisexual identity doesn't have to have the same sexual attraction in both sexes; normally, people who have interest in both sexes but have a different level of interest also identify themselves as bisexuals. Bisexuality is generally contrasted with homosexuality, heterosexuality, and asexuality. Bisexuality has been observed in various classes of human society as well as in animal groups throughout written history. The terms bisexuality, as hetero- and homosexuality were created in the 19th century C.E., bisexuality was romantic or sexual interest in men and women. The American Psychological Association asserts that \"sexual orientation is a continuum. \" In other words, a person is not necessarily totally heterosexual or homosexual, but can sense both at varying levels. Sexual orientation evolves throughout one's lifetime -- different people realize whether they're hetersosexual, bisexual, or homosexual at different points in their lives.\" Interestedness, customs, and sexual identity can also be different, for sexual interests or habits do not have to be consistent with sexual identity.

Pansexuality can be classified into bisexuality, some sources say that bisexuality involves romantic or sexual interest in all gender identities or has a sexual interest in a person regardless of the biological gender or that person's gender. In this sense, the term pansexuality is used alternating with bisexuality. The concept of pansexuality deliberately rejects binary gender, \"the notion of two types of gender and specific sexual orientation,\" because pansexuals are open to having relations with those who do not identify themselves as men or women. Bisexual activist Robyn Ochs defined bisexuality as \"potenance to be interested - romantic and/or sexual - in people with more than one sex and/or gender, not necessarily at the same time, not necessarily in the same way, and not necessarily in the same degree of interest.\" According to Rosario, Schrimshaw, Hunter, Braun (2006): ...the development of a lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB) sexual identity is a complex and often difficult process.

To be categorized as a pamphlet, UNESCO defines it as a need for publication that can consist of between 5 and 48 pages without cover, when more is called a book. Because of cheap costs and ease in production and distribution, pamphlets are often used to popularize political and religious ideas, or to spread news and advertising. The Indonesian pamphlet is from the English - pamphlet. Pamphlet without cover reached Central England in 1387 by the early name Pamphilet or panflet, from an old poem entitled Pamphilus: seu de Amore (Pamphilus: Concerning Love) written in Latin. The name Pamphilus itself comes from Greek, which means \"friends\" all of them. This poem was well - known in its time with a vast spread of the word pamphlet. It was associated with a commercial issue made as an argument of hatred leading to British Civil War; its meaning appeared in 1642.

At least some sources describe Shi'ah Muslims as denying destiny, and at least a Shii'ah scholar (Naser Maccares Shirazi) thinks \"the belief in destiny is a denial of justice.\" Islam understands destiny as part of a sign of God's power that must be believed as it is known in the turkey of faith.

The word prokaryota (caryon) was from Greece (pro-) \"before\" +  care\u03bd (caryon) \"tacks or seeds\". Procariota was divided into two domains: bacteria and Archaea. Archaea hasn't been recognized as a domain since 1990. Archaea was originally thought to live only in uncomfortable conditions, such as in extreme temperatures, pHs and radiation, but then Archaea was found in various habitats as well. Eukariota has a nucleus of cells containing DNA, while procaratics have no nucleus of the cell and their genetic material is not in the membrane. Because of the vast diversity of structure and genetics of both, in 1977 Carl Woese broke the procaritata into bacteria and Archaea (formeria and Archaebacteria), by proposing a three-domain system of Eukariota (or \"Euwork\"), Bacteria, and Archaea, which revised the two kingdoms. The genome of the procaritata is located in a DNA/protein complex in the cytosol, called the nucleusoid, which has no nuclear membrane. Procariota generally has no cell membrane compartments such as mitochondria and chloroplasts so that oxidative phosphorylation and photosynthesis occur along plasma membranes. However, procariota has internal structures, such as cytoskeletons, and special bacteria ordo Planctomycetes have membranes around nucleoids and cell membrane organelles. Procariota also contains only one stable chromosomal DNA circle, stored in a nucleusoid, while DNA in the eukaryota is found in a sealed, organized chromosome.

Bacteria and archea breed asexually, which is mostly binary fission or buds.

In addition to homology of actin and tubulin (MreB and FtsZ) components of the helix flagella, called flagellin, are one of the cytoskeletal proteins of the most important bacteria as the structural background provider of the chemox, the psychological response of the cell that is the base of bacteria. At least some procariota also contain intrasel structures of primitive organella. A membrane organ (or membrane between cells) is found in some procariota such as vakuola and membrane systems that are used exclusively for metabolism, such as photosynthesis or chemolithotrophy.

The compounds formed by hydrogen are many, more than compounds that can be formed by other elements. Various metal hydrides are being examined for use as hydrogen depositors in the fuel cells of electric cars and in batteries. The 14th hybrid is essential in battery - based energy storage technology. It also has an important role in organic chemistry as a powerful reformer. Every element in the periodic table (except for some noble gases) can form one or more hydrides. These compounds can be classified into three groups according to the properties of chemical bonds: except for electricity, the hydride ion is the simplest formable anion, which is made up of two electrons and a proton. Hydrogen has a low enough electron aminity, 72.77 kJ/mol, so the hydrodes are very baseless and will not be found in the solution. Nevertheless, the reaction involving the hydride in the solution remains, just as protons are so acidic that they cannot be found in the solution. The reactivity of the hydrida ion is hypothetically dominated by exothermic protonation, producing dihydrogen: Therefore, the hydride ion is one of the most powerful bases known. It will draw protons from almost all compounds containing hydrogen. Strong hydrogen electron Aphinity is also a strong reductor: In ionic hydrode or copy, hydrogen is considered a pseudohalide.",

These hydrades are referred to as binary if they involve two elements including hydrogen. The chemical formula for ionic binary hydrides is generally MH (such as in LiH). The higher the metal charge increases, the more covalent the M-H bond, as it is in MGH2 and AlH3. Ionic hydrodes are commonly found as base reagens in organic synthesis: Reactions like these are heterogenic because KH is not dissolved. The solvent commonly used in such reactions is ether. Water cannot be used as a pure ionic or RlC media because the hydride ion is a more powerful base than hydroxide. The hydrogen gas is released on this acid-base reaction: the alkali metal hydride reacts with the metal halida. Litium aluminum hydride (frequently shortened as GIAH) is struck by LiH's reaction to aluminum chloride. In the hydrida covalents, hydrogen bonds covalently with more positive elements, such as the boron, aluminum, and elements of 4-7 and berylliums. The compound commonly found includes hydrocarbons and ammonia. The neutral covalent hydride of molecules is usually volatile at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. Some hydride kovelan does not evaporate easily because it is polymeric, such as the aluminum and beryllium hydrida. By replacing a few hydrogen atoms in this compound with a larger ligature, it can be obtained the derivative of molecular compounds. For example, it consists of two aluminum centers interlocking with the hydride ligand.

When the tiol group is substituent in the alkana, there are several ways of naming: the term brandaptan comes from Latin mercurium captans, which means 'holding mercury', because the group -SH binds strong mercury elements. Many tiol compounds are liquid with a smell similar to that of garlic. The smell of tiol is often very strong and pungent, especially those with light molecular mass. Tilol will bond strongly to skin protein. Natural gas distortions began to add a variety of sharp-smelling tiol to the odorless natural gas after the recent explosion of New London school in 1937 in New London, deadly Texas. Nevertheless, not all tiles smell bad. For example, tioterpineol is responsible for the delicious aroma of Citrus \u00d7 paradition by due to the low electronegivity difference between hydrogen and sulfur, the S-H bond is practically nonpolar covalent. So the S-H tiol bond has a lower pattern than the O-H bond. Tiol does not show the effect of hydrogen bonds, neither of water molecules, nor of itself. Hence, tiol has a low boiling point and less soluble in water and other polar solvents compared with alcohol. The method of making tiol is similar to that of making alcohol and ether.

Andrew and Peter lived by working as fishing fishermen on the lake of Galilee. They lived together, together with Peter's mother-in-law, in the city of Capernaum. Andrew is recorded in the Gospel of John as a disciple of John the Baptizer who invited the people around him to repent and be baptized in the Jordan River. One day a young man came from Nazareth, who was later baptized by John the Baptizer. Then John the Baptizer gathered his followers together and said: The next day, Andrew and John stood by John the Baptist, when Jesus passed by. John the Baptizer pointed to Jesus and said: Andrew and John heard what John the Baptizer said and then immediately went after Jesus. But Jesus looked back. He saw that they were following him, and said to them, \"What are you seeking?\" They said, \"Our Lord, where do you live?\" Jesus said to them: \"Come and you will see it.\" And they came and saw where he was, and abode with him that day: and it was about four o'clock. And when he came home from his first meeting with Jesus, Andrew first met Simon, his brother, and said unto him, We have found the Messiah.",

So they turned away from him, and followed him. Andrew was chosen by Jesus to be one of his 12 principal apostles, as recorded in all the Gospels and Acts of the Apostles. Andrew always followed Jesus on his way. In the event of a miracle of feeding more than 5,000 people, Andrew played a role in in introducing the child who had brought five barley breads and two fish to Jesus in words: A few days before the Jewish Passover when Jesus arrived in Jerusalem before he was crucified, there were Greeks who wished to see Jesus. They came to Philip, from Bethsaida of Galilee, and said to him, \"Lord, we want to see Jesus.\" Philip went to tell Andrew; Andrew and Philip shared it with Jesus. When Jesus sat on the Mount of Olives, confronted with the temple, Peter, James, John and Andrew asked him alone, he began explaining the signs of the end of the days. After Jesus left them to heaven and the Holy Spirit descended 10 days later, Andrew served in Jerusalem, along with other disciples. According to tradition of early church figures, Andreas then preached the gospel all the way to Russia and Greece. In the last place of his apostle, Patras, he died crucified on an X-shaped cross, which eventually became a symbol of himself.",

Flagella vibrations in the choanocyte layer produce streams of water in spongocoel toward osculum, while fibril acts as a food catcher. According to the water flow system (not taxonomy), poriferas are divided into three types of Asconoids, Syconoids, and Leuconoids.

According to Apollodorus, an ancient Greek writer, Anaximandros (610-546 BC) was 63 years old at the time of the 58th Olympics carried out in 547/546 BC. Hence, Anaximandros was born about 610 B.C.E.

Modern pathologists also include geochemical and geophysics principles in the study of trends and geochemical cycles and the use of thermodynamic data and experiments to better understand the origin of rock. Experimental Petrology uses high-pressure equipment. High temperatures are used to investigate geochemical and phase relationships of natural and synthetic materials at elevated pressures and temperatures. The experiment is particularly helpful to investigate the rock on the upper crust and the upper coat that rarely survives its journey to the surface in its original condition. In geology, petrology is one part of basic geology. The word petrology comes from a combination of two words, which is the petros that includes rock and logos that mean science. From this combined word, petrology is defined as a science that studies the type of rock classification and the process of formation. In a broader sense, petrology is a science that studies rock in many ways. These methods include direct observation using vision, scans using microscopes, geochemical analysis and the use of isotopes.

Smith's \"The Tomato in America,\" tomatoes probably came from the western coast of South America. After Spain took South America, they spread tomato plants to their colonies in the Caribbean. Spain also took tomatoes to the Philippines, which became the starting point of spreading to other regions throughout the Asian continent. Spain also brought tomatoes to Europe. Tomato plants grow easily in Mediterranean climates. Tomatoes contain antioxidants of lycopene that can help combat the radical effects of cancer - free causes.",

One of the most popular types of correlations is the correlation coefficient of Pearson moments, which is obtained by dividing the second variable with its default multiplication. Despite the name Pearson, this method was first introduced by Francis Galton. The correlation of \u25aaX, Y between the two random modifiers X and Y with expected values \u25aaX and \u25aaY and the default intersection \u25aaX and \u25aaY defined as: Because \u25aaX = E\u25aaX2 = E\u25aaX2) and so for Y, then the Korelation can be calculated if the default finit and the two are not equal to zero. In proof of Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, correlation coefficients will not exceed 1 in absolute value. Correlation is 1 if there's a positive linear link, value -1 if there's a negative linear link, and between -1 and +1 that shows a linear dependency rate between two variables. The closer we get to -1 or +1, the stronger the correlation between the two variables. If those variables are free, correlation values are equal to 0. But that's not the case for the opposite, because correlation coefficients only detect linear dependencies between the two variables. For example, random X modifiers distributed uniforms at intervals between -1 and +1, and Y equals X2. Thus the value of Y is fully determined by X, so the correlation corelation coefficient of Pearson is parametric statistics, and he lacks to describe correlation when the basic assumption of a data's normality is violated. Non-parametric correlation methods such as \u25aa Spearman and \u25aa Kendall are useful when distribution is not normal. The coefficient of non-parametric correlation is still less powerful when compared with parametric methods if the normality of data is met, but it tends to give results when the assumption is not met.",

Based on several sources of ancient Chinese history that wrote about the history of Korea, Dangun was the founder of Gojoseon's kingdom, estimated precisely in 2333 B.C.E. Although the Dangun term is widely known as a founder, it is also defined as the title \"great chief\" used by all the next Gojoseon rulers, and possibly the real founder's name is \"Wanggeom.\" The ancient historical records of the Dangun have long been regarded only as legends and historians are still debating the events and dates of Joseon's establishment by Dangun. Although it is impossible to find any evidence to support the establishment of Gojoseon in ancient times, archaeological discoveries have proved that the region of the Korean Peninsula and its surroundings has been occupied by humans a few thousand years ago. Archeologists also found agricultural and bronze artifacts directly related to the existence of the first country in Korean history. Archaeological discovery proves that the surrounding regions of the Korean Peninsula began to be inhabited by humans long before the Dangun appearance and the establishment of the Gojoseon empire. Archeologists have discovered a large number of artifacts from Paleoliticum and Neolithics, including the cleft stone equipment used over 5000 years ago. With the end of the ice age of 10,000 years ago, the Korean Peninsula became a temperate region characterized by 4 seasons. At this time the Neolithic period developed on the Korean Peninsula and around it. The people of this age made tools of rock and rough pottery, building settlements that formed villages.

Throughout history many naturalists have studied various aspects of animal behavior, rooted in the study of Charles Darwin (1809-1882). But modern ethology discipline was thought to be born about the 1930s, and Austrian ornithologist Konrad Lorenz (1903-1989) and zologist Karl von Frisch (1886-1982). For his efforts, these three researchers were then awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine in 1973. Ethology is a combination of laboratory work and field observation, which has a strong connection to certain disciplines like neuroanatomic, ecological, and evolution. An animal behaviorist tends to take an interest in the process of a particular animal group, and often learns one type of behavior, such as aggression, in a number of nonregulated species. Ethology is a thriving field. Since the beginning of the 21st century, researchers have reviewed and reached new conclusions in many aspects of animal communication, emotion, culture, learning, and sexuality that scientific communities have long understood. New fields, like neuroetology, also begin to develop. The ethology term is derived from the Greek, which is the word ethos, which means \"usuality,\" such as ethical and ethical words. And then the word -logia means \"scientific\". The first time this term was introduced in English by American mirmecologist William Morton Wheeler in 1902. Although not accepted in academic circles, John Stuart Mill, in his book Logical System, Ratiosinative and Inductive (1843) defines Ethology as \"the science of character formation\" that will be a science of human nature that can't be provided by psychology.",

Viewed as part of biology, animal behaviorists specialize in the evolution of behavior and understanding associated with natural selection. Charles Darwin was thought to be the first modern ethologist, he wrote The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals (1872) that had an influence on ethologists. He channeled his interest in behavior by encouraging his student George Romanes, who investigated the learning and intelligence of animals using anthropomorphic, anecdotal cognitive methods, which did not get scientific support. Other early ethologists, such as Eug\u00e8ne Marais, Charles O. Whitman, Oskar Heinroth, Wallace Craig, and Julian Huxley, concentrate on the instinctive or natural behavior that occurs in all members of species under certain circumstances. The beginning of their study of the behavior of new species is to make ethograms (description of common behavior and the frequency of its appearance). This provides an objective cumulative behavior database, which can be checked and added by the next researcher. Because of Konrad Lorenz and Nikolaas Tinbergen studies, ethology flourished in Europe during the years leading up to World War II. After the war, Tinbergen moved to Oxford University and ethology became more powerful in England, with the added influence of William Thorpe, Robert Hinde, and Patrick Bateson in Sub-Department of Animal Behavior at Cambridge University. During this period too, ethology began to thrive in North America. Lorenz, Tinbergen, and von Frisch were both awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1973 for their work in ethology.",

In general, though, animal feed must contain the macronutines that the body needs in large quantities, such as carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids; and the micronutrients that the body needs in fewer amounts, such as vitamins and minerals. Feed formulation is closely related to the energy needs of an animal. Traditionally, animals are fed with human food waste and by - product of the food - processing industry. When the farming industry was growing, people were trying to provide large quantities of livestock and feed factories came up with commercial feed. When pets get popular, commercial feed for them also meets the market. In farms, feed is the most important element and is usually the largest cost component in animal care.

A 2013 animal biodiversity survey published in the journal Zootaxa mentioned that this figure is more than 25,000. Estimates of the total number of species that still exist have greater variations. A widely referred article published in 1993 estimated more than 1 million nematodes. A publication next opposes this claim on the grounds that the claim is not supported by fact, and it estimates that it is only 40,000 species. Estimates supported by the species' rich curves, along with the use of the DNA stem code, and the increased recognition of the widely-distributed species between the nematodes, have placed that number close to 1 million species. Nematodes have managed to adapt in almost every ecosystem, from the sea (salt water) to the ground, and from the polar regions to the tropics, and the highest altitude to the lowest. They're everywhere in a freshwater, ocean, and land environment, and they often outnumber other animals from both the total individual and the diversity of species. Nematodes were found in mountains, deserts, up to ocean basins, and found in every part of the Earth's lithosphere, even at a depth of 0.9 to 3.6 km) beneath the surface of the Earth in the gold mines of South Africa.",

Many of Nematodes become parasites, so they are categorized as pathogens, for most plants and animals (including humans). Nathan Cobb, a nematologist, explains the existence of Nematode on Earth: in short, if all matter in the universe except nematodes is washed away, our world will still be vaguely recognized, and if, as spirits without bodies, we can then investigate it, we must find mountains, hills, valleys, rivers, lakes, and oceans represented by nematodes. The location of the city will be understood, because for every human mass charging there will be a mass charging in accordance with a certain nematode. Trees will still stand in rows of ghosts representing our streets and roads. The location of various plants and animals will remain understood, and, if we have enough knowledge, in many cases even their species can be determined by their ancient nematode parasitic examination.\" Nematode classification is fluctuating along with the development of knowledge.

Democritos developed the thought of atoms that led to the more well - known Democritos thought in the history of philosophy. Besides being a philosopher, Democritos is also known for mastering many skills. Unfortunately, Democritos' work is not stored. Democritos wrote about science, astronomy, mathematics, literature, epistemology, and ethics. There are about 300 quotes of Democritos' thinking inside ancient sources. Most of those quotes are about ethics. Democritos was born in the city of Abdera, North Greece. He lived about 460 B.C.E. to 370 B.C.E. He came from a wealthy family. When he was young, he used his inheritance to travel to Egypt and other Eastern lands. Besides becoming Leukippos' disciples, he also studied with Anaxagoras and Philolaos. There's little to be known about Democritos' history. A lot of data about his life has been mixed up with legends whose truth is hard to believe. Although he was a contemporary of Socrates, even younger, Democritos was still classified as a pre-socratic philosopher. This is because he went on and developed the teaching of atomicism of Leukippos which is a pre-socratic philosopher. The teachings of Leukippos and Democritos can hardly be separated. Moreover, Democritos philosophy was not known in Athens for long. For example, Plato knew nothing about Atomism. Aristotle then took great note of the view of atomicism. Democritos and his teacher, Leukippos, argue that atoms are the elements that make up reality. Here, they agree with the teaching of Empedocles pluralism and Anaxagoras that reality consists of many elements, not one. However, contrary to Empedocles and Anaxagoras, Democritos thought that these elements could no longer be divided.",

The atoms differ from the others through three things: they're like letter A different than N), they're in sequence (like An is different from NA), and they're positioned (A is different from Z in alphabetical order). Thus, atoms have sheer quantity, including mass. The number of atoms that make up this reality is endless. Furthermore, atoms are also viewed as unmade, indestructible, and unchanging. What happens to atoms is motion. Therefore, Democritus stated that \"the fundamental principles of the universe are atoms and voids.\" If there's empty space, then those atoms can move. Democritus compared atomic motion to a situation when sunlight entered a pitch-dark room through the cracks of a window. It'll show how the dust moves through all the directions, even though there's no wind to cause it to move. Thus, it doesn't take any other principle to make the atoms move, like the principles of \"love\" and \"hate\" according to Empedocles. There's enough empty space to make those atoms move. The world and all of reality are created because different atoms are intertwined with each other. The related atoms then start to move around, and the longer the more atoms are involved in that movement.

Jura was the middle period of the Mesozoic era, also known as the \"Dinosaur Zaman\". The beginning of this period was marked by a Trias-Jura extinction event. The name of this period was given by Alexandre Brogniart based on the multitude of sea limestone found in the Jura Mountains, in German, French, and Swiss gathering areas where the limestone strata of the period was first identified. By the early days of Jura, Supercontinen Pangaea had begun to divide into two major lands: Laurasia in the north, and Gondwana in the south. It creates more coastlines and transforms the previously dry continent climate into moisture. And there are lots of deserts in the Trias Period replaced by dry rain forests. Dinosaurs were the dominant animals in Jura's time, Jura ended up with a small extinction event. The Jura period is divided into three sections: Beginning, Middle, and End. Similarly, in strategy, the Jura period is divided into Jura Bottom, Central Jura, and Jura for rock formations. Separation of Jura into three parts comes from Leopold von Buch.

The initial relationship with Islamic broad tradition is believed to have originated in the 15th-century Empire of Demak.

The Aztecs are made up of different tribes that inhabit central Mexico, especially the Nahuatl tribes that inhabit most of Mesoamerica from the 14th to the 16th century. Aztec civilization gave birth to a number of city nations (altepetl). Some of them joined in forming alliances, political confederates, even empires. The Aztec Empire was a confederate of three city states formed in 1427, Tenochtitlan (Mexica or Tenochca), Texcoco, and Tlacopan. The city of Tlacopan was formerly part of the Tepanek Empire centered in the city of Azcapotzalco. Although it is often called a special name for the Mexican Tenochtitlan, the Aztek term is also used as a common term for the cities and the Nahua peoples in the middle of Mexico both in pre-Spanish times and in the Spanish occupational times. Aztec definitions as well as Aztecs have long been a topic of scientific language since German scientist Alexander von Humboldt, used it early in the 19th century. Most of the peoples in the central region of Mexico in the Pascalic era had the same mesoamerican cultural traits, and a large number of Aztec cultures could not simply be described as typical Aztecs. For the same reason, the idea of \"the Aztecs\" should be understood as one of the special scopes of the Mesoamerican general civilization. The civilization of central Mexico includes the generosity of corn crops, the classification of peoples into pyiltins and common people (machatualtins), the worship of many gods (Tezcatlipoca, Tlaloc, and Quetzalcoatl), and the xiuhpohualli date system that is alongside the calendar system of tonalpohualli (260 days).",

This empire was an empire of tribute collectors who expanded its political hegemony to faraway places from the Mexican Valley by conquering other city states throughout Mesoamerica at the end of the Postcalak period. The Aztec Empire was formed in 1427 as an alliance of the city of Tenochtitlan, the city of Texcoco, and the state of Tlacopan. The three cities allied together to defeat the Tepanecs of the city of Azcapotzalco that ruled the Mexican Valley. Soon thereafter, Texcoco and Tlacopan were reduced to junior partners in the alliance, and Tenochtitlan became the most powerful. The empire expanded its power by combining business and military conquest. The Aztec Empire is not a territorial empire that controls an area by placing large numbers of military garrisons in subjugated provinces, but it is an empire that rules its lower city states by building friendships with its subjugated rulers through intermitting marriages, and by spreading imperial ideologies into its inferior city states.

Archea cells have a unique trait that separates archea from two other domains of life, Bacteria and Eukaryota. The Arkea is divided into several filums. The classification is difficult because the majority of the archea has not been isolated in the lab and only detected the gene sequence from samples taken from the environment. Arkea and bacteria generally have similar sizes and shapes, although some archea have very strange shapes, such as flat, rectangular cells like Haloquadratum walsbyi. Although there are morphological similarities between archea and bacteria, archea has genes and several metabolic pathways that are more similar to eukaryota, especially enzymes involved in transcription and translatation. One aspect of the archea biochemical unique is the dependency of the archeatic lipid ether on their cell membranes. Arkea uses more energy than eukaryota, which ranges from such organic compounds as sugar, ammonia, metal ions, or even hydrogen gas.

No clear example has been found for pathogenic or parasitic archea. On the other hand, archea is often a qualityist or a commensurate, such as a methane that lives in human digestive tracts and ruminansia, where they live in large quantities and helps the digestive.

Microbiologists try to classify microorganisms based on the structure of cell walls, shapes, and substances they consume. In 1965 Linus Pauling and Emile Zuckerkandl proposed using gene sequences in various procaritas to identify their relationship with one another. This approach, known as phylogenetics, is the primary method used today.

These are the Prophets of Allah, and those who have been taught the Book (the Quran), and the Prophet (Muhammad SAW), and the Prophet (Muhammad SAW), and those who are Al-Muttaqun (the pious - see V. 2:2). practically, Salafi argued that Muslims should rely on the Qur'an, Sunnah and Ijma', giving them priority over later interpretation of religion. This movement aims to renew Muslim life and it has exerted great influence on many Muslim thinkers and movements throughout the Islamic World. From the beginning, Salafism had developed by means of efforts by various Islamic reformers, whose activities spread throughout the region. The term Salafi was made by Ibn Taimiyah in the 8th century Hijriyah, and Muhammad bin Wahhab revived this term in the Najd region in the 12th century H, which made Salafi a reform movement founded by one of the most prominent representatives of the modern era. The doctrine of Salafi is based on looking back into the early years of Islam to understand how contemporary Muslims should practice their faith. Salafi rejects religious or heretic innovation and supports the application of the sharia. In his political approach, movements are sometimes divided by academics and Western journalists into three categories: the largest groups are puritans (or quiet), who avoid politics; the second largest groups are activists, who maintain regular involvement in politics; and the third group are jihadists, who form minorities and encourage armed struggles to restore early Islam.",

Usually, a Salafy believer describes himself as \"Muwahidin,\" \"Ahl Hadits,\" or \"Ahl at-Tauhid.\" The point of the basic ideologies of the salafi is that Islam was completed in the days of Muhammad and his companions, therefore there was neither innovation nor addition nor reduction in the way of Islam.

In addition to its sweet taste and fascinating aroma, tapies are also made with different colors. The color comes, not from dangerous artificial dyes, but from natural dyes. To make a red lynx tap is used by numerals, pigment produced by Monascus purpureus, while green solids are made using extracting pandant leaves. Tapai's production requires a high degree of care and hygiene so that cassava or fermentation can become soft because of a well - being fermentation process. The leaven is a mushroom seed used to make a tapai. To make the tape successfully tools and materials used must be clean, especially from fat or oil. The oily tools used to prepare taps can cause fermentation failure. The water used must also be clean; using rainwater can cause taps to fail. Tapai fermentation can increase the content of vitamin B1 (timina) by triple. This vitamin is needed by the nervous system, muscle cells, and digestive system in order to function properly. Since it contains a variety of bacteria that is both safe and safe, taps can be classified as a source of probiotics for the body.",

They emphasize that true happiness is an undependence to something random or floating. So the Cynics rejected the happiness of wealth, strength, health, and spirituality. As a flow of philosophy, Sinism is primarily how its adherents live and behave (even Diogenes of Sinope, which presents Sinope as a philosophy, shows the debate as whether sinism is a philosophy or a way of life). It was never a formal philosophy mazhab; nor, never had, and never could have, a physical school building of philosophy; nor would it ever have a philosophy. But philosophers at the time believed that Sinism contained some sort of philosophy project, that Plato called this stream \"the mad Socrates.\" Words such as cynicism, cynicism, have a negative connotation of fervority, pessimism, doubt, disease; an insult that other people hold; are not convinced of ideals and humanity. Synicism is also regarded as a belief that humans are self - centered, hypocritical, insincere, and only good to themselves. The Cynic philosophy was first founded by Antisthenes lived in 445-365 B.C.E., which was one of Socrates' faithful followers. Antisthenes in the language and logic are empathically nonsyntic; and the direct association between Diogenes and Anthynes is chronologically somewhat problematic.

The disposal became the catalyst of his most dramatic changes in life. This assumption confirms that there is no connection between the two. The history that seems most likely to be trusted is the encounter with Alexander the Great. One day Diogenes was sunning up when Alexander the Great, for wanting to see this great philosopher, approached him and asked if there was anything he could do for him, Diogenes replied, \"Get out of my light! \"because Alexander blocked the sun. Diogenes ' life was indeed astonishing, he lived in a wine pot often called a bathtub, eating from and drinking very simple, minun from the cold mountain water, not drinking wine, not eating bean vegetables, not wearing shoes, only wearing two coats of clothing in winter without a robe.

Crates came from Boeoti, from Thebes, who rejected his prosperity, and joined the Cynic stream. He seemed more joyful than Diogenes; according to some reports, every house in Athens was open to him, he was even called a servant of the house of God.

The definitions of these experts can fully describe the meaning and purpose of training. According to Cut Zurnali (2004), the goal of training is for employees to master knowledge, skills, and behaviors emphasized in training programs and to apply them to their day-to-day activities. This means that the goal of training is for employees to be able to master the knowledge, expertise and behavior that are emphasized in training programs and to be applied in the everyday activities of employees. Training also has a profound effect on corporate development. Cut Zurnali (2004) exposes some of the benefits of training held by Noe, Hollenbeck, Gerhart, Wright (2003), namely: According to Cut Zurnali (2004), there are 3 (three) levels or levels of analysis in determining the need for training to be met, namely: According to Desssler (contion:1997:263), training gives new employees or old skills that they need to perform their work. So training means showing a driver how to operate his new machine, for a new salesman, how to sell his company's product, or for a new supervisor how to interview and evaluate employees.",

In the legends of some Asian countries, Jivaka is known as \"King of Medicine.\" He was considered a source of reference to traditional physicians (Sanskrit: vaidya) a number of Asian countries. The descriptions of Jivaka can be found in various Buddhist texts, both in ancient traditional texts that speak Pali and M\u25aalasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da as well as in sutta-sutta and Avadana in the next period. Although it is stated that Jivaka was born as a court servant, her history is not known for certain. The historical record says that Jivaka was cared for and raised in the royal court of Magadha. As he grew up, Jivaka went to Taxila to learn traditional medicine from a well - known teacher. He later became an outstanding disciple there. After studying for seven years, Jivaka returned to Kinggriha to open a practice of medicine. His medical skills made him famous and became a physician of the Magadha family during the time of King Bimbisara. Jivaka is also the physician of the Shakya clan's family which is in the Magadha region, where Siddhartha Gautama was born from this clan. Because of his closeness with Siddhartha, later on Jivaka included the main proponent of Buddhist religion. Jivaka also played a role in bringing King Ajatasatru, who took the throne in place of Bimbisara's father, to become a Buddhist. Traditional texts tell us that Jivaka was able to perform complicated medical procedures, including medical actions that could be interpreted as brain surgery, but this interpretation became the debate of historians. Jivaka was respected as an exemplary physician and a saint in Buddhist teachings in Asia throughout the ages by buddhis and some unreligious physicians.",

A stamp is attached to envelopes, postcards, or other postmarks before being delivered. Payment using stamps became the most popular way to pay payment than any other way, such as using an aerogram.

This country is the only country that doesn't have to put the country's name on stamps. The stamp on the truth is a picture piece of paper published by the government that in the back generally contains tape, while the front contains a certain price intended to be attached to the postal mail. By pasting the stamp on a letter means that the delivery fee has been paid by the mailer, and in return the post is obliged to deliver the letter to its address at the destination. Mail-insert activity and the postposing system were actually known to humans before they became known to the stamps. And every government builds tools and infrastructure to support the activities of the postal system. For example, the Anyer-Paran Highway built by the governor - generals of the Dutch Indies (Herman Willem Daendels), is known as the Highway. Before that date there was a stamp but not officially, it could not be used by the public, but only by certain nobles.

Sir Rowland Hill approached the girl as he asked her why she refused to receive the letter. The girl's answer came as a surprise. The letter that came from her lover contained some markings that only the two of them knew about. Without having to open the letter, the girl knew exactly what the letter meant. So, why does he have to go through all the trouble of paying the mail. This upsets Sir Rowland, for when that happens often, what a loss the postal service has had as well as what happens to the employees who work in it. In addition to the case, what made Sir Rowland also think of stamps was when Sir Rowland studied taxation and administrative science, while also observed the social development of the British economy at that time. In 1830, when the British nation developed into an industrialized country, transportation was making quite a joyful progress. The railways began stretching from West to East and from North to South. At that time, Rowland Hill was thinking about how to get money in cash for the royals from the mail delivery tax. Even the mind of the tax delivery papers.

In this day and age, Michaelangelo's works are beginning to gain appreciation. In 1504 he began working on his most famous work, David, which was then displayed in Piazza della Signoria. This work was meant to be a symbol of the Republic's power on the threat of opposing factions in the Roman region.

Michaelangelo was called to Rome in 1503 to complete the previous pope's rest. It is a sign that Michaelangelo's works and abilities have been widely acknowledged.

This condition occurs after a person is injured, infected, or chronic health problems that affect blood circulation. The main cause of gangrene is a decrease in blood supply to tissue infected with gangrene, resulting in cell death. Long - term diabetes and smoking contribute to the risk of gangrene. There are different types of gangrene with different symptoms, such as dry gangrene, wet gangrene, gas gangren, inner gangrene, and necrotising fasciitis. Gangrens can be handled in a way that can be handled (if severely amputated) to infected parts of the body, antibiotics, vulcular surgery, maggot therapy, or hyperbaric oxygen therapy. The treatment depends on where the gangrene is located and how many of those parts are broken. The best way to do that is to restore the smoothness of the blood flow from related organs, which can restore the germination and heal it. Other treatments include the use of antibiotics, wound protection, debriment and amputation. In the United States 30,000 to 40,000 amputations are done every year. The use of antibiotics alone is ineffective, since antibiotics do not penetrate the infected. High - pressure therapy oxygen is used to treat gangrene gaseous oxygen. It slowly increases air pressure, so blood will carry more oxygen and inhibit the growth and reproduction of anaerobic organisms. A regenerative therapy has been developed by Dr. Peter DeMarco to treat gangrene using procaine and PVP. He applied his therapy to prevent amputation.

The Pandavas chose the Wirata empire as their cover site. In that place, King Wirata and Queen Sudesna have hosted Pandawa and Dropadi. It is told that in the beginning Sudesna was interested in Dropadi's paras (under the pseudonym \"Malini\") who was walking around the market. He asked for the identity of Dropadi.

But Dropadi looked so graceful and moved like a noble woman that Sudesna suspected him. In the end, Sudesna considered herself overly alert, and she appointed Dropadi as her attendant. As a satirdri, Dropadi also showed his role as a faithful and nimble servant.

All procariota is unicellular, except for the myxobacteria that was once multicellular in one of its biological life cycles. The word prokaryota (caryon) was from Greece (pro-) \"before\" +  care\u03bd (caryon) \"tacks or seeds\". Procariota was divided into two domains: bacteria and Archaea. Archaea hasn't been recognized as a domain since 1990. Archaea was originally thought to live only in uncomfortable conditions, such as in extreme temperatures, pHs and radiation, but then Archaea was found in various habitats as well. Eukariota has a nucleus of cells containing DNA, while procaratics have no nucleus of the cell and their genetic material is not in the membrane. Because of the vast diversity of structure and genetics of both, in 1977 Carl Woese broke the procaritata into bacteria and Archaea (formeria and Archaebacteria), by proposing a three-domain system of Eukariota (or \"Euwork\"), Bacteria, and Archaea, which revised the two kingdoms. The genome of the procaritata is located in a DNA/protein complex in the cytosol, called the nucleusoid, which has no nuclear membrane. Procariota generally has no cell membrane compartments such as mitochondria and chloroplasts so that oxidative phosphorylation and photosynthesis occur along plasma membranes. However, procariota has internal structures, such as cytoskeletons, and special bacteria ordo Planctomycetes have membranes around nucleoids and cell membrane organelles. Procariota also contains only one stable chromosomal DNA circle, stored in a nucleusoid, while DNA in the eukaryota is found in a sealed, organized chromosome.

In addition, procariota cells are usually smaller than eukariota. Similarly, eukaryota and procaritata both contain large RNA/protein structures, called ribosomes, which produce proteins. Bacteria and archea breed asexually, which is mostly binary fission or buds. A genetic exchange and recombination can happen, but it's a horizontal gene transfer, and it's not a replication, which involves DNA being transferred between two cells, as is the bacteria conjugation. Recent research indicates that all procariota have a cytoskeleton more primitive than a cytoskeleton eukiota. In addition to homology of actin and tubulin (MreB and FtsZ) components of the helix flagella, called flagellin, are one of the cytoskeletal proteins of the most important bacteria as the structural background provider of the chemox, the psychological response of the cell that is the base of bacteria. At least some procariota also contain intrasel structures of primitive organella. A membrane organ (or membrane between cells) is found in some procariota such as vakuola and membrane systems that are used exclusively for metabolism, such as photosynthesis or chemolithotrophy. Some species also contain microcompartements accompanied by proteins that have a specific physiological role (e.g., carboxsisome or air vakuola). Most procaritata measures from 1 \u25aam to 10 \u25aam, but they may vary in size from 0.2 \u25aam to 750 \u25aam (Thiomargarita namibiensis).

Compounds containing a functional group of epoxide can be called epoxy, epoxy, oxyrana, and etoxinin. Simple Epoxide is sometimes referred to as oxide. Hence, epoxide ethylene (C2H4) is ethylene oxide (C2H4O). Most of these compounds have a trivial name, ethylene oxide referred to as \"oxyrana.\" Some names emphasize the presence of a functional epoxide cluster, such as at the 1.2-epoxykloheptana compound, which can also be referred to as 1.2-heptena oxide. A polymer formed from precursor epoxide is referred to as epoxy, but it does not contain the epoxide group (or contains only a few remaining epoxy groups that remain in the form of resin). Most of the epox that's industrialally produced is ethylene oxide and propilene oxide, which is produced each one on a scale of about 15 million tons and 3 million tons per year the opening-cin reaction dominates the reactivity of their epoxide is a potential electrophyil. Alcohol, water, amina, tiol and many others can act as nucleophyils for this reaction. This reaction is the basis for the formation of epoxy and production of glycol. In acidic conditions, the position of the nucleophyil attack is influenced both by the iron effect (as it is commonly seen in the SN2 reaction) and by the stability of carboxation (as it is commonly seen in the SN1 reaction). A hydrolysis of an epside in the presence of an acid catalyst produces a glycol. Hydrolysis requires adition of water nuclei to epoxide. In base conditions, nucleophyils attack less substitutiond carbon, according to the standard pattern for the SN2.",

The book, Euklides concluded theorems of what is now called the Euklides geometry of a small group of actionomas. Euklides also wrote a work on perspective, cone slices, ball geometry, number theory, and mathematical proof. Little is known about the life of Euclides because very few original references to him survive. He was most likely born about 325 B.C., whereas the place, the state of his birth and death, could only be roughly estimated to be relative to the history of the others mentioned with him. Although rarely mentioned by other Greek mathematicians, such as Archimedes (about 287 B.C.E. - 212 B.C.E.), he was called the \"Secretist of Elements.\" Some historical references to Euclides were written by Proclus (c. 450 C.E.), eight centuries after Euklides lived. A detailed biography of Euklides was written by an Arab writer, for example, that the city of his birth was Tyre. It is generally believed to be fictitious. If Euclides came from Alexandria, he should have known the Seraceum of Alexandria, and the Library of Alexandria, and he might have worked there in his lifetime.

Proclus believed that Euclides must have lived during Ptolemy I (c. 367 B.C.E. - 282 B.C.E.) because his name was quoted by Archimedes. Although the quote was referred to as an interpolation by Archimedes editors, it is still believed that Euklides wrote the Element before Archimedes wrote his work. Proclus also tells the story that, when Ptolemy I asked him if there was an easier way to learn geometry than the book of Elements, \"Euklides replied there was no easy way to geometry.\" The Anekdot is doubtful because it is similar to a story that tells about Menaechmus and Alexander the Great. Euclides died about 270 B.C.E., possibly in Alexandria.

After the eruption, the chromomagma condenses into solidity when exposed at very low temperatures. Criovolcano is usually formed on satellite-es and perhaps other low - temperature celestial objects (like Kuiper belt objects). The energy needed to melt the ice and produce the kriovolkano is usually derived from tidal frictions. It is also possible that frozen material deposits can produce a greenhouse effect below the surface that will accumulate the required heat. Kriovolcano was observed in Triton, Neptune's month, as a geyser, through a Voyager 2 ride that passed it in 1989. On November 27, 2005, Cassini photographed a geyser in the south pole of Enceladus.

In biochemistry, hydroxilation reactions are often facilitated by enzymes called hydroxilase. Hydroxilation is the first step in oxidative degradation of organic compounds in the air. This process is vital in detoxification because hydroxiation converts lipoplic compounds into water-soluble products that are more easily eliminated by kidneys or livers and secreted. Some pharmaceutical drugs (for example, steroids are activated or activated by hydroxiation. The hydroxiation process involves conversion of the CH group into a COH group. Hydroxilation is an oxidative process. Oxygen inserted into the C-H bond usually comes from atmospheric oxygen (O2). Since the O2 itself is a slow hydroxulator, it takes the catalyst to speed up the process. The primary hydroxulator agent in nature is the p-450 cytochrome, and there are hundreds of known variations. Other hydroxiculators include Flavin. The resulting residue of hydroxilation in human proteins is most frequently found as prolins. This happens because in fact collagen is putting together about 25-35% of the proteins in the human body, and it contains hydroxin in almost every 3rd residue in its amino acid sequence. Hydroxilation occurs in the atoms \u25aa-C, forming hydroxyprolin (Hyp), which stabilizes the secondary collagen structure as a result of the powerful electronegative effects of oxygen atoms.

Macrophages can be found in various coagulations, especially in connective tissues such as those connected to digestive tracts, in the lungs (in body fluids or alveoli), and along certain blood vessels in the liver, and in the entire spleen where the damaged blood cells are recycled out of the body. This type of macrophage is called fully differentified macrophage. The macrophage is able to migrate out of the vascular system by crossing the cell membrane from the capillary vessel and entering the area between the cells being targeted by the pathogen. Neutrophyil is the most efficient phagocyte followed by macrophages, and it can digest large amounts of bacteria or other cells. The binding of bacteria molecules to the macrophage surface receptor triggers the process of decomposition and destruction of bacteria through \"respiratory attacks,\" causing the release of reactive oxygen specion (ROS). Pathogens also stimulate macrophages to produce chemokines, which call for other phagocyte cells around infected areas. In addition to acting as phagocytes, macrophages can also serve as antigen test cells (APC). The role of macrophage as APC is visible in effector function, but it lacks meaning in naive lymphocyte activation. Macrophages are not activated by the stimulation of a number of cytokines like TNF, IL-1 counted, lL-15 and IL-8.

On the Earth's surface, sediment rock composition covers 65% clay rock, 20%25% sandstone and 10%-15% carbonate rock. Claystones can be distinguished into mud, shale, and loinstones. Whereas carbonate rock can be distinguished into limestone and magnesian limestone. Metamorphic rock is the rock formed through the metaformism of frozen rock or sediment rock. Change is due to high temperatures. Pressure and temperature that affect the formation of metamorphic rock exceeds pressure and temperature in the formation of frozen rock and sediment rock so that it can transform the original mineral into another mineral. Metamorphic rock includes bad water - bearer media. The level of exposure becomes the primary determiner of its level of axis. In addition, the axis of metamorphic rock is determined by pattern, property and frequency of rupture. The deeper the location of the metamorphic rock, the lower the axis. Stones are found in the earth's belly as well as on the earth's surface. Rock sightings are mostly in the bowels of the earth and few are seen on the surface of the earth. The rocks in the earth's belly are large in size and are connected to the earth's abdomen. The rocks on the earth's surface vary in size and can be observed directly.",

In addition to being a philosopher, he was well - known in the field of rhetoricals. Like any sophis, he also taught and gathered students. Gorgias wrote a book called \"About Nothing or Nature.\" In addition, he also wrote several books on rhetoricals, which only a few fragments are still stored. Two works known to be written by the Gorgias are the Encomium of Hellen and Defense of Palamedes. Georgians were born in Leontinoi, Sicily. He was born about 483 B.C.E. and died in 375 B.C.E. at 108 years of age. He was a disciple of the philosopher Empedocles and was influenced also by Zeno dialectics. In 427 B.C.E., he came to Athens as an ambassador from his hometown to seek help against the city of Shirakusa. He's circling Greek cities, especially Athens. In Athens the Gorgias experienced great success as an orator. In the work \"About Nothing or About Nature,\" the Gorgias expressed his view of man's inability to know something. There are three thesiss on which the argument is based: What the Gorgias here are referring to is neither skeptical nor nihilism. He used the method of arguing Mazhab Elea, especially Zeno and Melissos, to show that their arguments could be passed on until it became impossible. After the Gorgias made up the work \"About the Nothings or About Nature,\" he left philosophy and came up with rhetoricals. According to the Gorgias, he did not teach a certain value. Every human has a different view of value. For example, what a man considers to be of no value to a woman.",

Thales made some observations on static electricity around 600 BC, where he believed that amber-generated friction was magnetic, the opposite of minerak like magnetite that didn't need to be rubbed. Thales at the time was not yet correct that attractions were caused by magnetic effects, but science later proved the connection between magnetism and electricity. According to a controversial theory, the Parthians may have had knowledge of electroplating, based on the discovery of the 1936 Baghdad Battery that resembled galvani cells, although it was not yet known whether the artifact was electrified in nature.

It puts out the Latin New Electricus (\"like amber\", as it is  careth), electron, ancient Greek word for \"amber\") to refer to the nature of attracting objects lightly after rubbing. This word was finally absorbed in the English words \"electric\" and \"electricity,\" which first appeared in the printed writings of Thomas Browne, Pseudodoxia Epidemicca, 1646.

As a sexual orientation, heterosexuality refers to \"a pattern or a fixed character to experience sexual attraction, compassion, physical or romanticity to people of different genders\"; it also refers to \"a person's identity based on above interests, related habits, and membership in a community of interest like his.\" This term is usually applied to humans, but it is also observed in all mammals. Heterosexuality is one of the three principal classifications of sexual orientation, along with bisexuality and homosexuality. All three are part of a heterosexual-homosexual unity sequence. This term is etymologically formed by adding the Greek to the \"sex\" or \"other\" as a combination of \"sexuality.\" Sexual orientation demography is difficult to establish because of the lack of data available. Nevertheless, the history of human sexuality shows that attitudes and habits vary somewhat in various cultures. The neurobiological masculinization of the brain has been quite understandable. Est radiol and testosterone, catalyzed by enzyme 5-reductase being hydratestosterone, binds to androgen receptors in the brain to make it masculine. If the androgen receptor is too few (in humans with unsensitive androgen syndrome) or too many (woman with adgenial hyperplasia), there will be physical and psychological effects. It has been thought that male and female heterosexuality is the result of such a variety of processes. According to this study, the heterosexuality in women has to do with a low level of masculinization in the brain compared with what was found in lesbian women. However, in heterosexual men, there are a number of studies that support that his masculinization is higher than homosexual men, but some other studies just prove otherwise.",

Most of the reproductive processes in the animal world are facilitated through heterosexual relationships, although there are also animals that reproduce in asexual way, such as protozoans and lower spineless animals. Sexual reproduction actually does not require a heterosexual orientation, for sexual orientation refers to a long - term pattern of sexual and emotional attraction that guides to a social bond that is usually also long - term. Meanwhile, sexual reproduction requires only basic acts of intercourse that are often committed only once at a time.

According to Alfred Kinsey's writings entitled Sexual behavior in the Human Male as well as some other modern studies, the majority of humans have experience or sensations of heterosexual or homosexual, so that they are categorized as bisexual. Kinsey's research consistently found that sexual orientation is something that develops into many facets throughout one's life; rarely, but not obliged to happen, including forming new interests in one's gender.

In a totalitarian country, political power is often held by autocrats or dictators who run campaigns all over the line, where propaganda is broadcast by the country's controlled media. Totalitarian regimes are often marked by powerful political repressions, no democracy, no glorification of individuals widely and firmly, absolute control of the country's economy, massive censorship, mass surveillance of its private and public lives, limited freedom of movement (including the right to leave the country), and the use of methods of terrorism as a state tool to control its citizens. Other aspects include the use of concentration camps, repressive secret police, persecussion or ban on religious freedom or state atheism, death penalty conduct, rigged or sabotaged process of elections to support the ruling regime (if held), possession of weapons of destruction, potential mass murder or government genocide, and the possibility of war, opulence or occupation of other countries. Historian Robert Conquest described the totalitarian country as a country that recognizes unlimited power in every public and individual sphere and widens its power as long as possible. Totalitarianism was first developed in the 1920s by lawmen of the Republic of Weimar and then the Nazi Party of Carl Schmitt and simultaneously by fascist groups in Italy. An Italian fascist, Benito Mussolini stated: \"Everything in the country, no one leaves the country, no one against the country.\"",

The term carbonil can also refer to carbon monoxide as a ligament in inorganic compounds or organologic complexes (e. g. carbon's nickel); in this situation, carbon binds a threefold bond with the oxygen of C BriarO. A carbonil cluster is characterized by the following kinds of compounds: other carbonil compounds include urea and carbage. Examples of inorganic carbonyl compounds are carbon dioxide, carbon sulfide, and phosgena. Oxygen is more electronegative than carbon, so the electrons would be drawn from the carbon and increase the polarity of the bond. Hence, carbon carbonyl is electrophilic, making it more reactive to nucleophyil. Besides, oxygen that is electronegative can also react with electrophyil. Hydrogen alpha at carbonyl compounds is more acid (~1030 times the same) than the usual CH bonds. For example, the value of pka acetaldehyde and acetone are 16,7 and 19, in a row. Amida is the most stable carbon-coopling carbonil due to her high resonance stability between the Nitrogen-carbon-Oxgen bonds. The carbonil clusters can be reduced by reagen hydrides like NaBH4 and LiAlH4, and by reagen organologists like organolitium and reagen Grignard. Other important reactions include: carbonil compounds, the fear-fearing is an important carbonil compound group with a general structure C-C=O. In these compounds, carbonil clusters are conjugated with an alkena. It causes these special properties of this compound. For example, this compound is acrolein, mesityl oxide, acrylic acid, and maleic acid. Carbonil can be created in labs using aldol reactions and Perkin reactions. The carbonil clusters, either in aldehidics, acids, or ketons, draw electrons from the alkena and alkena clusters on the untended carbonyl, thus lowering reactivity to electrophyils such as bromin or chlorideic acid.",

Almost all ctenophoras are predators, their food consists of microscopic larvae until small crustaceans, even other ctenophora, are parasites. Ctenophora is often compared to spiders that have various ways of catching prey, some who remain silent and use their tentacles like a web, and some become active predators in hunting prey.

Sponges, cnidaria and ctenophora have a pair of cell layers that flank the jelly layer, on this jelly layer sponge called mesophyil, while in cnidara and ctenophora it's called mesoglea. Unlike sponges, cnidaria and ctenophora have cells connected to each other in the network, and they also have muscles, nervous systems, and senses systems. What distinguishes cnidaria and ctenophora, is cnidara uses nematosista sting tools containing knidocytes to catch its prey, while ctenophora uses coloblas tape cells that are found largely in its tentacles (except ctenophora from Nuda classes that have no tentacles and Haeckelia rubra that harness the knophocytes from its cnidara prey). Ctenophora is a filum of few species but of diverse forms. The species near the coast are stronger than the high seas species because they have to withstand the waves and marine particles that are spread out by water, so species near the coast are easier to catch to study than fragile, difficult high seas species. The species of the open sea are studied through photographs and records of explorers. Hence, ctenophora near the coast such as Pleurobrachia, Beroe, and Mnemiopsis are better known. Ctenophora has radial symmetry. Like cnidaria, the body of ctenophora consists of thick mesoglea similar to the jelly that is flanked by two epitels, a layer of cells connected to each other. The ctenophora epitel consists of two layers of cells, while the cnidaria is just one.

Shepherding is one of the oldest jobs in the world that people have done in Asia Minor about 6 thousand years ago. Shepherding or grazing events begin with the discovery of easily tamed animals (not wild) when they meet humans who are then kept. To keep the grazing animals from going far away, they are bound with ropes drawn from the bark or the vegetation that resembles the rope. Between the shepherd and the plant, the beginning was almost the same. Shepherding and planting activities began to take place after the existence of nature as a supporter around a group of human beings back then began to be pressured by human activity or natural factors. Sheep are farmed for their milk, meat, and fur. Small numbers of sheep are often kept on family farms, and they are raised with other livestock such as pigs and chickens. And when they are multiplied, their flocks are fed, moving from one pasture to another. The work of herding sheep is born from the need to oversee the flock and guard it from wolf attacks and other predators. Shepherds also oversee the movement of the herd, and take it to the market when it is time to shave its feathers. In addition, ancient shepherds also milked their livestock themselves, and they cultivated animal milk into cheese. Shepherds play an important role in the economic field of a number of cultures.

Auksin plays an important role in plant growth. The role of auksin was first discovered by Dutch scientist Fritz Went (1903-1990). The function of this auksin hormone helps in the process of speeding up growth, whether root growth or stem growth, accelerates crevice, helps in the process of cell division, accelerates the cooking of fruit, reduces the number of seeds in the fruit. This auksin hormone works synergy with cytoxin hormones and giberelin hormones. The vegetation on one side of the sun illuminates it, so its growth is slow because the auksin's work is blocked by the sun, but it's the side of the plant that the sun does not shine on because the auksin is not blocked. So this is going to cause the plant's extremities tend to follow the sun's direction or what's called phototropy. To distinguish plants that have many hormones or less we have to know the anatomy and physiology of plants so we're easier to figure out. And for the plants that are placed in the light and dark, between them, for the plants that are placed in the dark, their growth is swift, and the texture of their stems is weak, and they tend to be pale in color. This is because the work of auksin hormones is not blocked by sunlight. For plants that are placed in the light, their growth rate is a little slower than those that are placed in the dark, but the texture of the stem is very strong and also its fresh greenness, it's because of the work of the auksin hormones being blocked by the sun.",

Auksin is one of the hormone plants that can regulate many physiological processes, such as growth, cell division and differentiation and protein synthesis (Darnell, dkk., 1986). Auksin is produced in an active meristimatic network (that is, shoots, leaves, and fruits) (Gardner, dkk., 1991). Then auxin spreads widely throughout the plant's body, dispersing it from top to bottom, through a root-growing tissue, through a tapus (floem) or a parentchim (Rismunand, 1988). Auksin or also known as IAA = Indolasetat acid (that is, as the main auksin in the plant), dibiosinthesis of precursor tripan acid, with the result of a natural substance of auk (anasin) but has less activity than an IANlathyto niltri, =Tinary =Adoxylruva and Isatididididididia.

Other African regions, on the other hand, have known and cultivated bananas since a thousand years before the Common Era. By the same time, Hawaii had become acquainted with and cultivated bananas through shipments from the Canaria Islands. The major centers of bananas are located in the Malesia ( Southeast Asia, Papua, and Australia's tropics) areas. The center of minor diversity is also found in tropical Africa. These plants love tropical and damp climates, especially in the lowlands. In an area with an even area of rain throughout the year, banana production can go on without knowing the seasons. Indonesia, the Pacific Islands, Central American countries, and Brazil are known as major banana exporters. In 2018, India became a country with the highest banana consumption, above China and Indonesia.",

This country was discovered in 1722 by one Dutch citizen named Jacob Roggeveen. At the time, the form of government from that small country was a kingdom. In the 19th century, parts of this country were broken up and became a struggle between Germany, the United States and England. At that time, the kingdom was ruled by a king named Malitoa Laupepa. In 1898 the king was replaced by Malietoa Tooa Mataafa. Britain and the United States whose economic and political background support the Tanu Malietoa are none other than the sons of the late King Laupepa for their benefit. On March 15, 1899, the United States and the United States launched an attack on Samoa precisely in the State of Appia by throwing bombs. Finally, it was formed by the Samoa Tripartiete Convention which led to the decision to divide the islands of Samoa into three parts. Britain acquired a part of this country called the Solomon Islands. The United States took part of what was called American Samoa (American Samoa).

The recipe for this ceremony is similar to that of a typical Indonesian fruit line, only its fruit is roughly cut, not thinly sliced, and the returning orange is the main ingredient. It is believed that if the whole field is sweet, the baby is female, and if it is spicy, the baby is male.

        "paragraph": "Empedocles was a philosopher of mazhab pluralism. Another figure of this mazhab is the Anaxagoras. If the Miletos philosophers taught that there is one fundamental principle that unites the universe, Empedocles argues another. According to Empedocles, the basic principle is not single but four. He was known as a doctor, a poet, a speechist, and a politician. Empedocles wrote two works in the form of poetry. The first is called \"Natures\" (On Nature) and the second is called \"Purification-Purifications.\" Both works have 5,000 verses, but the remaining 350 verses of the first, and 100 verses of the second work. Experts disagree about which essays are written first. Empedocles was born in Agrigentum, the island of Sicily, in the 5th century B.C. (495-435 B.C.). He's from the noble class. Empedocles was influenced by a religious stream called orphism, as well as by Pythagoreans. There's another source that says he's following Parmenides' teachings. At an unknown age, he was banished from his hometown but had no information about his exile. According to Aristotle's description, Empedoles died at the age of 60. Legend has it that Empedocles died by diving into a volcano crater on Mount Etna. Empedocles argue that the principle governing the universe is not single but consists of four anesques or substances. Well, he hasn't used an anesthetist term that Plato actually just used, but he's using the term 'root' (rizomata). Four of them are water, earth, fire, and air. They are able to find each other in the universe. The fire is associated with the hot and the air to the cold, while the soil is associated with the dry and water is associated with the wet.",

Previous philosophers, such as Anaximenes, still mixed the air with fog. Empedocles argues that all anesans have the exact same quantity. Anasir himself has not changed, so, for example, the soil cannot become water. However, everything in the universe consists of all four of them, although their composition differs. For example, Empedocles states that bones are made of two parts of earth, two parts of water, and four parts of fire. An object can change because the composition of the four is altered. Empedocles says there are two principles that govern the changes in the universe, and those two principles are opposite to each other. Both principles are love (philotes) and hate (neikos). Love served to combine the anessir while it hated the function of divorce. Both are described as fine liquids that permeat all other objects. On the basis of both principles, Empedocles classified the events of the universe within four ages. These times are constantly spinning; the first goes back to the fourth and then back to the first, and so on. Those times were Empedocles explaining introductions based on the principle that \"the same would know the same.\" This means that the soil element inside us knows the soil, just as the water within knows the water, and so on. For this reason, Empedocles argues that blood is the primary part of the human body, since blood is considered the most perfect mixture of the four anesques, especially the purest blood that surrounds the heart. Empedocles ' thinking has an impact on biology and medical sciences in the following areas.

The use of \"gen\" in everyday conversations (e.g. \"gen smart\" or \"gen hair color\") is often intended for allele: the variety options available by a gene. Although allele expressions can be similar, people use the allele term more often for gene expressions that are phenotically different. Genes are symbolized with letters. The dominant gene uses capital letters while the recessive gene uses lowercase letters. Gregor Mendel had speculated about a material associated with a quality or character inside the body of an individual that could be passed down from one generation to the next. He called it a factor. By Hugo de Vries, a similar concept he named pangen (read: \"pan-gen\") in his book Intracellular Panenesis (bit 1889).

He and his son and successor Janautya played an important role in the consolidation of the land of Kuru, the formation of Weda slokas into a collection, and the development of orthodox srauta ceremonies, making the kingdom of Kuru a dominant cultural and political center in the region of North India in the Iron Age. Parikesit's history is mainly recorded as legends in the Mahabharata and Purana. In the name of God, the son of Abimanu and Utari, are the descendants of Arjun. According to Mahabharata, he reigned 24 years and died when he was 60 years old. In a legend in the book of Adiparwa and Bhagawatapurana, it was told that Parikesit died of being bitten by the Taksaka Dragon. According to the book of Adiparwa, the dragon disguises itself as a caterpillar and hides inside a nut that is served to Parikesit. The manner of death occurred because of a brahmana curse named Srenggi who was hurt because Parikesit had poured a dead snake around his father's neck. In the sacred library of Weda, there is only one Parikesit; however, post-Weda literature (Mahabharata and Purana) seems to indicate the existence of two kings by the name of Parikesit, the one before the Kurukshetra War and was the ancestor of the Panda (the Mahabharata), the other after the Pandawa and its descendants.

Lapworth observed that animal fossils in this disputed strata differ from animals during both the Cambrian and the Silar period so that they should have their own periods. This period is divided into 3 times, the early Ordovicium, the central Ordovium, and the final Ordovium. During this period the sea level was very high.

The base was formed by a type-n silicone trunk that was littered lightly. Two ohmic B1 and B2 connections added to both ends of silicone rods. The resistance between B1 and B2 when the emitter is in an open chain called interbase resistance. There are two types of single encounter transistors, which is: the UJT is triggered with positive voltage between the two bases. It causes a decrease in voltage along the device. When the emitter voltage is raised approximately 0.7V above the voltage of the P diffusion, the current starts flowing from the emitter to the base area. Because the dipply base area is so light, additional currents (in fact the charge in the base area) cause conductivity modulation that reduces base resistance between emitor meetings and B2 channels. The reduction of resistance means a more advanced emitter meeting, and even when more currents are injected. Overall, the effect is negative resistance on the emitter channel. This is the reason why the UJT is so useful, especially for simple oscillators. UJT circuits were once known for transistor electronics fans around the 1970s and early 1980s because the UJT allowed the creation of simple oscillators made with only one active device. Now, as the IC becomes more popular, oscillators like the IC times 555 are used more frequently. In addition to using the relaxation oscillator, one of the most important use of UJT and PUTs is to ignite the steptor (such as SCR, TRIAC, etc.). In fact, DC voltage can be used to control UJT and PUT circuits because the device's life time increases according to the increase in DC's voltage control.

Archea cells have a unique trait that separates archea from two other domains of life, Bacteria and Eukaryota. The Arkea is divided into several filums. The classification is difficult because the majority of the archea has not been isolated in the lab and only detected the gene sequence from samples taken from the environment. Arkea and bacteria generally have similar sizes and shapes, although some archea have very strange shapes, such as flat, rectangular cells like Haloquadratum walsbyi. Although there are morphological similarities between archea and bacteria, archea has genes and several metabolic pathways that are more similar to eukaryota, especially enzymes involved in transcription and translatation. One aspect of the archea biochemical unique is the dependency of the archeatic lipid ether on their cell membranes. Arkea uses more energy than eukaryota, which ranges from such organic compounds as sugar, ammonia, metal ions, or even hydrogen gas.

This approach, known as phylogenetics, is the primary method used today.

This is seen in contrast with the dependency on divine revelations found in many Christian teachings, Jewish Islam and other teachings of theism. Pandeys usually reject the Unseen and tend to assert that God is the only One God. What organized religions see as divine revelations and sacred books, deists see as interpretations made by other men, not from powerful sources. Pandeism ideas began in Ancient Greece with Herakleitos. They reached in the Middle Ages by Eriguna. But the first formal greeting of this theory was in Germany in 1787. The most extensive book in pandeism was written by Max Bernhard Weinstein in 1910. Pandeism is a deism sub-category, and is a sub-sub-category of theism, in a good recommendation in the god's beliefs. As in deism and theism, pandeism is on the basis of religious beliefs that can be built. The concept of deism includes various positions on various religious issues.",

Pandeism, on the other hand, can become a god in belief, a doctrine of government or another godlike definition. Pandeism can be similar to naturalism. Hence, often Deism is thought to give meaning to the formation of the universe to a higher life with a framework that allows only to regulate the process of creation of nature. The word deism and theism are two words that refer to the word God: Herakleitos' most famous thinking is about changes in the universe. According to Herakleitos, nothing in the universe is fixed or permanent. Nothing really exists, everything is in the process of being. He is known for his sayings, \"Everything flows and nothing remains.\" That unrelenting change is imagined by Herakleitos in two ways: everything that keeps changing in the universe can run regularly because of logos. The view of logos here should not simply be compared to the concept of logos on the mazhab Stoa. Logos is a ratio that becomes a law that controls everything and moves everything, including people. Logos is also understood as material, but it transcends ordinary matter at the same time. This was because in those days, no philosopher was able to separate between spiritual and material ones. According to Herakleitos, each object consists of the opposite. Nevertheless, in the resistance there is still unity. In short, it can be said that 'that one is many and many are one.' Anaximenes also had this view, but the difference with Herakleitos was that Anaximenes said the contradiction was an injustice, while Herakleitos claimed that there was a principle of justice.",

Anthropology is derived from the Greek word \"man\" (in the sense of \"calculable\") or \"human\" or \"people\" and logos which means \"badness,\" or etymologically anthropology means science that studies people. In doing human studies, anthropology puts two key concepts: Holistic and Compotive. So anthropology studies are very concerned with aspects of history and a thorough explanation to describe humans through the knowledge of social science, as well as humanities. Anthropology aims to better understand and appreciate man as the biological entity of homo sapiens and social beings in an interdisciplined and comprehensive framework. Thus, anthropology uses the theory of biological evolution in giving historical meaning and fact in explaining the course of mankind on earth from the beginning of its appearance. Anthropology also uses cross-cultural studies to emphasize and explain the difference between human groups in the perspective of cultural material, social behavior, language, and the view of life. With its holistic orientation, anthropology is divided into four interconnected branches of science, namely: Biology anthropology, Social Anthropology, Archaeology, and Linguistics. The four branches have their own concentration studies in academic specialty and scientific research, with unique topics and different methods of research. Anthropology was born or started with the interest of Europeans in physical traits, customs, and other ethnic cultures that were different from those known in Europe. At the time anthropological studies were more focused on the population of a single society, single in the sense of the unity of the community living in a common geographical region, having similar physical and language characteristics, and the same way of living. Yet in its development, anthropology then ceases to be a mere study of the single human group that inhabits a similar geographical region.",

As well as from social sciences, anthropology teaches organizations social and cultural relationships, genetic systems and kinship, spirituality and reliability, institutions, social conflicts, etc. Early anthropology came from classical and Persian Greeks who studied and tried to understand observable cultural diversity. By now, anthropology (end of the 20th century) has become central in the development of some new interdisciplinary fields such as cognitive science, the study of globalization, genetics, and various ethnic studies. The enormous anthropology consists of either biological anthropology or physical anthropology is a branch of anthropology that teaches humans and primates not humans (non-human primes) in the biological, evolution, and demographic sense.

Hair emerges from epidermis, although it comes from the follicles of hair deep below the dermis. Hairlike structure, called a trichoma, is also found in plants. There are different colors of human hair. But the natural color is quite divided into six large groups: black, brown, blonde, auburn, red and gray. Auburn means rosy chocolate. The gray-and-white hair is found only in parents, albinos, and in some cases tyrosine deficiencies. What regulates the color of human hair? Pigmen that regulate hair color are two kinds of eumelanin and feomelanin. Remember that melanin is not the same as melanin. Melanin is a dark brown pigment; it regulates the different colors of human \u25aabiologists. From skin color to irises to hair color. The albinos suffer from a fairly heavy melanin deficit, so it's almost no melanin at all on its skin. Whereas melamin is a plastic that is used as a layer for various households and industries; which are often inserted into milk to increase nitrogen levels, but can cause kidney dysfunction. Eumelanin (which means true melanin) gives the hair a dark color. Judging from its chemical structure, the eumelanin is a protein containing the amino acids of the tirosine. Eumelanin formation requires a tirosinase enzyme, which combines the amino acid tirosin to the dopa and dopamine molecules. Tirosinase is more active in adults than in children or teenagers. But parents are not so active anymore. Hence, tirosin deficiencies can affect the color of human hair. The lack of tirosine causes the color of hair that should be dark to fade.",

In its earliest practice, nail characters were thought to be used for bookkeeping at palaces or temples in Sumer area. Moreover, it is also used for commercial activity. From Sumer, nail characters then developed to Akkad (an area north of Sumer). From this point on, nails developed (in Akkad) and were widely used in the ancient Middle East.

The Semitic equation of many signs is transformed or shortened to form the new \"phonetic\" value, because the nature of this syllable, fined by the Sumerians, is not intuitive to those who speak Semitic. This \"mixed\" style was passed on until the end of the Babylonian and Assyrian empire, although there were periods in which \"purism\" became fad and there was a tendency to spell out long words, with a preference for using phonetic complements.",

The most common type of silk is silk from cocoons produced by the larvae of mulberry silkworms (Bombyx mori) that are farmed (the caterpillar farm). Silk has smooth texture, soft, but not slick. The shimmering appearance of silk's appeal comes from a triangular prismlike structure in the fibers that allows silk fabric to reflect light from various angles. Wild Sutra is produced by caterpillars other than mulberry silkworms and can also be treated. Wild silks have been identified and used in China, South Asia, and Europe long ago, but the production scale has always been much smaller than farm silk. Wild silk differs from domestic silk from color and texture, as well as wild cocoons collected by moths that emerge before the cocoon are removed, so the silk thread that formed the cocoon has been cut short. The cattle silkworm is killed by being dipped in boiling water before the release of an adult moth, or stabbed with a needle, so that the entire cocoon can be broken into an unbroken thread. This allows silk to be woven into a stronger cloth. Wild silk is usually more difficult to dye than farm silk. Silk is also produced by some other insects, but only silks from silkworms are used to make textiles. It's also done studies on other silks that show the difference in the molecular aspect. Silk is produced primarily by insect larvae that have a complete metamorphosis but are also produced by some adult insects such as Embioptera.

The causal system's necessity and authenticity are part of human sciences that have been shared and are not overwhelmed by any doubt. The causality is built on a relationship between an event and a second event, which the second event is understood to be the consequence of the first. The causality is a basic assumption of science. In scientific methods, scientists designed experiments to determine the causality of real life. Embedded in scientific methods is a hypothesis about causal relationships. The purpose of the scientific method is to test the hypothesis. The causality reasoning became one of the most central competences that made it possible to adapt in the world. The causality knowledge allows for a prediction of the future or to diagnose the cause of something. Planning and solving problems are done using the knowledge of causal relationships. Causal logic supports computational logic, both inductive and deductive. The causality goes into linear tissues, often using measurements of theoretical and rated relationships. The causality is also associated with the set of facts or events in reality. Unlike empirical people who believe the events that happen after other events can't be said to have causality laws. The causal reasoning is intrinsic reasoning when some of the effects of what is considered to be the cause or some of the causes are concluded by what is considered to be the effect.

And the sufficient reason for that is that of a certain event. For example, the existence of oxygen is the absolute cause of burning, but not enough for burning occurs because obviously oxygen can exist without burning. However, there is a degree of temperature that causes the presence of oxygen to cause combustion. In addition, certain conditions exist, for they are used in another sense, such as events or actions in the presence of existing conditions that normally cause certain events to occur or not to occur. In this third sense, there is a distant cause, an event that is far away from what it looks for and a close cause or a direct cause, an event that is closest to what it is looking for. For example, the insurance company sent an investigator to find out because of the fire, the insurance policy holder's act of lighting a fire was a direct cause, while the fact that it could have been as far away as the crop failure. The causal relationship is understood as a subject in a number of certain conditions, so it makes sense to ask how A can be prevented from causing B, how one allows A to cause B, or how relationships A and B can be intervened. Each statement that a particular state is the cause of a certain phenomenon implies some causal laws. It's the law of descriptiveness.

Some time later, the king's queen was pronounced pregnant. By the time Sunanda was pregnant enough, she gave birth to a handsome son. The son was named \"Sannu\" because the son was born when King Pratipa was in peace and quiet. In the book of Adiparwa is told that when Goddess Ganges came down to earth to redeem herself, she met with King Pratipa who was standing in the Ganges. The goddess Ganga fell in love and sat on the right thigh of the king. He asked the king to be willing to take her as his wife. Pratipa said that she was not captivated by the beauty of Ganges because she had mastered her passion. She also said that Ganges was on her right thigh, which meant where the child asked for his father's lap. So King Pratipa viewed Ganges as his son - in - law if he had a son.",

Food consumed by humans is called food, whereas food consumed by animals is called feed. The quality of a meal can be judged by the food energy and the age it holds. Consumption of improper or inadequate food will cause malnutrition, and it can affect various health disorders. In addition, some foods may trigger food allergies when consumed by sensitive individuals.

Food is a subject learned in various sciences, such as food science, nutrition or nutrition, and gastronomi. Most food comes from plants. Some food comes directly from plants. The cereal grain is a basic food that provides more food energy around the world than any other kind of plant. Corn, wheat, and rice - in all its varieties - contribute 87% of all grain production worldwide. Most of the grain produced worldwide is fed to livestock. Some foods that do not come from animals or plants include edible mushrooms, especially mushrooms. Mushrooms and bacteria are used in preparation for fermentation and pickles such as unleavened bread, alcoholic beverages, cheese, pickles, kombucha, and yogurt.

Marhaenism at its essence is an ideological struggle formed by Sosio-Nasionalism, Socio-Democracy and Godliness of Karno Bong. According to marhaenism, to be economically independent and free of exploitation, each individual or household needs a factor in production or capital. It can be a land or a machine. In modern contexts, vehicles, information technology devices, kitchens and electronics may be properly empowered as capital or production factors. Although it's not big, ownership of its own capital needs to guarantee the independence of those people or households in the economy. Unlike capitalism, the capital in marhaenism is not to be hoarded or doubled, but it is to be used to make ends meet and produce surplus. Farmers grow enough to feed their own families, only to sell their surpluses or excesses to the market. A tailor, a tailor or a laborer produces items that he will use in part, even though the rest will certainly be sold. Ideally, these self-sufficient terms must be met first before serving the market. This means that when laborers, artisans or farmers produce goods that they won't consume themselves, they just act as a production factor for the other side, which makes them vulnerable to being dictated by the market or exploited. Agregated in the maphaenism economic system, things that aren't needed won't be produced, because everyone/house must have checked the profile and the extent of their own needs before creating anything. The innovation of the birth of a new product will occur when its needs are solid. This led to the attainment of efficiency, as well as to prevent waste of resources and consumer attitudes.",

Their bodies are compiled from a series of similar units called proglotids, a packaging containing eggs that are regularly released into the environment to infect other organisms. Another subclass, which is Cestodaria, is mostly parasites in fish. All members of Cestodes act as parasites and their living cycles vary, but usually adult worms live in the digestive tracts of vertebrates, and young worms sometimes live in other species, both vertebrates and invertebrates. For example, the genus Diphyllobothrium has two intermediary hosts, one crustacean and at least one freshwater fish, while its definitive host is a mammal. Some types of Cestodes are specific to their host, while others become parasites in various species. Some 6,000 species of Cestode have been descripted, and perhaps all vertebrates act as hosts for at least one species of Cestode. Adult tapeworms have a head, a short neck, and a corrugated body composed of proglotid-proglotid. The tapeworm attaches itself to the inner part of the host's intestine using scolex, which generally has hooks, suckers, or both. Cestodes don't have mouths and they suck nutrients directly from their host's digestive tract. The worm's neck constantly produces proglotid. Every proglotid has a reproductive channel. The ripe proglotid is filled with eggs and will separate from the worm body and leave the host body, either passively in host waste or actively moving. All ribbon worms are hermaphrodite because each individual has both male and female reproductive organs. Humans can be infected by several species of ribbonworms if they eat less mature meat, such as pork meat (containing Taenia Solium), beef (T. saginata), an fish (Diphyllopothrium), or if they live or eat food prepared with inadequate hygiene (Hymenolepis or Echinoccus).",

Hence, it is often called atheistic religion. Although many of those who define themselves as atheists tend to secular philosophy such as humanism, rationalism, and naturalism, there is no specific ideology or behavior that all atheists value.",

This term is often used in debates between early Christians and the followers of the Ancient Greek religion (Helenis), each of which calls each other an atheist ulteriorly. Atheism was first used to refer to \"own belief\" at the end of the 18th century in Europe, primarily referring to distrust of the monotheist God. In the 20th century, globalization expanded the definition of this term to refer to \"disbelief in all gods,\" although it was still common to refer to atheism as \"imposition of God.\" Lately, there's been an urge in a particular philosophy group to redefine atheism as \"a sense of belief in gods,\" rather than atheism as belief itself. This definition is very popular among atheistic communities, although it is still very limited in its use. Writers differ in defining and classifying atheism, namely whether atheism is a personal belief or whether it is simply a lack of trust, and whether atheism requires a conscious and explicit rejection. Various categories have been submitted to try to distinguish the forms of atheism. Some ambiguity and controversy involved in the definition of atheism lies in the difficulty of reaching the consensus in defining words like gods and gods. Polluality in the concept of divinity and gods causes a difference in thinking about the application of the word atheism.",

This fermentation is generally known as \"the tempe range.\" Whenever that grows on soybeans hydrate complex compounds into simple compounds that are easily digested by humans. Tempe is rich in fiber, calcium, vitamin B, and iron. Various types of fertilization have medicinal value, such as antibiotics to cure infections and degenerative antioxidants.

Soybean skin is peeled at the peeling stage so that the fungi's mycelium can penetrate the soybeans during the fermentation process. Bribery can be done by hand, stomped by foot, or with a peeler of seeds. After peeling, the soybeans are soaked. The purpose of soaking is to hydrate soybeans and to allow lactic acid fermentation to occur naturally for the acidity needed for fungi growth. Lactic acid fermentation is characterized by the emergence of acidic and foam in laceman water as a result of the growth of Lactobacillus bacteria. If the growth of lactic acid bacteria is not optimum (for example in subtropical countries, acid needs to be added to laceman water. This fermentation of lactic acids and acids has also proved beneficial to increase nutrition value and eliminate toxic bacteria. The final washing process was performed to remove dirt that may have been shaped by lactic acid bacteria and to prevent soybeans from being too acidic. Bacteria and manure can stunt the growth of fungi. The innoculation is done with an addition to the inoculum, namely tempe or laru leaven. The innoculum can be when it grows and is dried on the leaves of the waru or the leaves of the teat (called the wearer; used traditionally), the spores when the tempe is in the flour medium (dimen, rice, or tapioca; much sold on the market), or the pure R. Oigosporus (um is used by tempre makers outside Indonesia). Inoculation can be done in two ways, which is: Once inoculated, soy beans are wrapped or placed in a container for fermentation.

Plato, in Kratillos, connects the name Apollo to the \"purify,\" \"accustom,\" with \"aploun,\" \"simple.\" Hechichus linked the name Apollo with the Doria (apella) of the language, meaning \"majelis, \" so Apollo was referred to as a political god. Another possibility is that the applelai comes from an ancient form of Apollo that can be compared to the Appaliunas, the god of Anatolia whose name probably means \"the father of the lion\" or \"the father of the light.\" The Greeks linked Apollo's name to the verb \"ruining.\"",

        "paragraph": "In modern times, it has been suggested that the name Apollo came from the gods of Hurria and Hittis mythology, Aplu, which was worshiped during \"the time of the plague. \" Aplu himself comes from the mythology of Akkadian, Aplu Enlil, meaning \"son of Enllil,\" a title given to the god Nergal, associated with Shamash, the Babylonian Sun god. There are two common opinions regarding Apollo's origin: One is that Apollo came from the east, another opinion linking Apollo with the Doria and their god Applelaios (also). Walter Burkert states that its origin can be seen from its worshipers: the Greek Doria, the Creten-Minoa, and the Syro-Hittist. In the first opinion, both Apollo in Greece and Etrusca began to appear in the Aegean of the Iron Age (between 1100 B.C.E. - 800 B.C.E.) from Anatolia. Homer told me Apollo sided with the Trojans in the Trojan War, and he was associated with the Luwian god, Apaliunas, who seemed to travel from east to west. The Aplu god (the gods of Hittis and Hurria mythology in the Last Bronze Age, between 1700 and 12200 B.C.), is also similar to Apollo told by Homer, who is a god of plague. Besides Aplu also symbolizes the rat god Apollo Smitheus. Apollo's principal shrine is in Delos and Delphi. In his cult practice, Apollo Delos and Apollo Pithia (Apollo Delphi) had become so different that both could have their own temples in the same city. Apollo's worship was also shown by names affected by Apollo, such as Apollodors or Apollonios and the city of Apollonia. Apollo has a famous orakel in Delphi, others in Klarus and Brankhidae. Its Orakel in Abae, Fokis, where he was called Apollon Abaios (Greek language: \u0567\u03bd \u25aa\u25aa101), was often visited by Kroisos.Orakel, among other things: The festival for the Apollo god (among them was the Boedromia, Carneia, Danephoria, Delia, Darthia, Metageitnia, Pyanepsia, Pythia and Thargelia festival.",

Two sons of Diti, Hiranyaksa and Hiranyacaspu, were the reincarnations of two Waikuntha gatekeepers, Jaya and Wijaya. Once upon a time, Hiracikaks tried to drown the Earth into the cosmic ocean, but the effort was thwarted by the God Vishnu who materialized as Waraha (forest pig). At that very moment, Hiranyaksak was killed by Waraha. Then Diti's other son, Hirayacaspu, became king of the Detyas. He stopped all forms of worship to God because he hated Vishnu.

After all these years, Kasyapa appeared before Diti to bestow on her a gift of offspring that could defeat Indra, but Diti had to meet the requirements for the offspring produced in accordance with expectations. Among other things, Diti's requirements were: she had to stay in Shamanpankacaca for a hundred years; she would not eat during the night; she would not sleep with her hair down or under a shower before; she would sleep under a tree at night; she would not do any sort of exercise.

After birth, the whole section materialized as gods and they were called Marouts, based on the word Indra spoke while in Diti's womb.

After ten thousand years of prayer, Diti gave birth to a son who was as strong as Bajra (Indra's weapon).

Gondwana was formed because of the collision of several kratons. Eventually, Gondwana became the largest continent crust during the Palezoic era when compared with other continent crusts and had an area of about 100,000,000 km2 (39,000,000 miles2). During the Carbon Period, Gondwana moved north of the earth and then hit a small Euramerika Supercontinent, which later formed a supercontinent called Pangea. Gondwana (with Pangea) slowly began to experience divisions during the Mesozoic Era. The remains of Gondwana take land about two thirds of the current continent, including South America, Africa, Antarctica, Australia, the subcontinent of India and Arabia. Gondwana began to form some 800 million to 650 million years ago with the Orogenys of East Africa, when India collided with the army and followed by East Africa, and ended at 600 - 530 million years ago with the Brazilians orogenies and the Kuunga that added to the continent's mass, then the South America hit with Africa and Australia and Antarctica on each continent, which eventually formed Gondwana. The mechanism must be behind the disunity of Gondwana still unknown. Some theory experts believe that \"hot dots,\" where the magma is very close to the surface, melting and breaking up the Supercontinent separately. In 2008, however, researchers at the University of London suggested that Gondwana be split into two tectonic plates, which were then ruptured. The existence of Gondwana was first hypnotized in the mid 1800s by Eduard Sues, a geologist of Vienna who called the theoretical continent \"Gondwanaland.\" Suess was given a tip by a similar fern fossil found in South America, India, and Africa (the same fossil will later be found in Antarctica).",

Suess got the name Gondwanaland from the Gondwana region of central India, where geological formations match the same age in the southern hemisphere. This formation began some 1.1 billion years ago. Gondwana was then known as Proto-Gondwana or Protogondwana. The Rodinian Proto-Gondwana itself was formed about 1.1 billion years during the formation of the Rodinian Supercontinent that eventually became part of the Supercontinent. Rodinia finally split up about 750 million years ago leaving Proto-Laurasia, Proto-Gondwana, and Kraton Congo as the only land on Earth. Proto-Gondwana became one of the giant continents on Earth along with Proto-Laurasia except Kraton Congo because its form was too small. About 633 million years ago, the world's lands began to merge, finally forming one Supercontinent, which is Pannotia. Pannotia isn't really one land that's whole because it's archipelago-shaped like Rodinia. Pannotia split some 100 million years after its formation near the beginning of the Cambrian period. At the beginning of Cambrian, Pannotia split into many continents and kratons formed. Gondwana is better known as Gondwanaland. Gondwanaland became the mainland at the time.

For example, Hikaru Genji's protagonist from the Tale of Genji is called \"Hikaru no Kimi\" or \"Hikaru-gimi.\" But before the Nara period, the emperor was often called \"opokimi\" (great lord); so controversial whether the word \"kimi\" in \"kimigaya\" initially meant the emperor. During the Kamakura period, \"Kimigaya\" was used as a party song among samurai and then became popular among the people during the Edo period. At the end of the Edo period, \"Kimigaya\" was used in oku (harem of Edo Castle) and Satsuma-han (now Kagoshima Prefecture) as a common new year celebration song.

And, the phrase \"Kimigao\" shows our country, Japan, which has the Emperor on its throne as a symbol of the nation and the unity of the people with the will-based consenssus of Japanese citizens. And it makes sense to take the lyrics of \"Kimigaya\" means hope for prosperity and lasting peace of state. Parties against the Liberal Democratic Party, who were in control of the government at the time of Obuchi's prime minister, strongly opposed the government's understanding of \"kimi\" and \"Kimigaya\".

The United Nations Convention on the International Sea Law in 1982 (UNCLOS \u056782) chapter 121 defines the island (British: island) as \"the land that is formed naturally and surrounded by water, and is always on the face of the water at the height of the tide.\" In other words, an island must not sink when the tide rises. The application, which must be met in order to be called an island, is this: Thus, sand burning, mud, or coral, which is steeped in high tides, by the above definition as an island. As well as burning mud or exposure to mangroves, which are steeped in high tides, although mangrove trees always appear on the face of the water. Islands have all kinds of names in Indonesia. The non-standard shape is pulo. The word pinjman of Sanskrit is also often used, nusa. Off the east coast of Java people refer to small islands as gili. In Indonesia, by definition, a small island is an island that has less or equal to 10,000 kilometers. Continents and islands are words to describe land territory. Depending on the map of the world and the globe, each continent can be isolated from the island. The difference is not only in size but also in other aspects. The most important difference between an island and a continent is its size. The island is often described as a land smaller than the continent and is surrounded by water on all sides. However, this definition does not say up to what size an island would be referred to as a continent.",

Continents are a vast and larger land mass than islands. Continents may contain large numbers of islands and can cover many countries; they can also be allocated by countries at physical and political boundaries. Rather, both sides of the island are described as a small continent surrounded by pools. On the other hand, Greenland (over 2,160,230 km2) is a giant island and has a much larger size than most countries in the world remain called an island. Continents, far from the obvious size difference, are also different from islands because of diversity in land, fauna and flora. Because the land is vast, many people from different cultures can live together on the same continent within their borders. It can only accommodate a small group of people at once. The main difference is that between Greenland and Australia, Australia is almost four times greater than Greenland. Aboriginal peoples, while Greenland's peoples, social groups (Inuit), can be found throughout the North Pole, including parts of Canada, the United States, and Russia. One island can be renamed, while the neighboring continents can be called one. This is often associated with Europe and Asia, because the two continents are interconnected on land: the name \"Eurasia\" connects Europe and Asia, although because of political and cultural differences, not every continent has always been that way. Most of the cultures on this continent are different from other continents. This island may also have an entirely different culture from the continent on which it resides, or if it's part of a particular continent or country, it can be linked to the management and culture of the continent.",

Along with Archaea domains, bacteria are classified as procariota. Bacteria cells have a particular shape, such as spheres, rods, or spirals, which are usually several micrometers in size. Bacteria are one of the first life-forms to emerge and currently inhabit most of the habitats on Earth. Bacteria can live on soil, water, acidic hot springs, radioactive waste, up to the Earth's crust. Bacteria also form a symbiotic relationship with plants and animals. Most bacteria are not known for their character, and only about 27 percent of bacteria filum have species that can be grown in labs. The study of bacteria is called bacteria, one of the microbiology branches. Almost all animals depend on bacteria so they can survive because only bacteria and a number of archea have the genes and enzymes necessary to synthesize vitamin B12. This vitamin is obtained by animals through the food chain or is produced by microorganisms that live in their digestive system. There are about 40 million bacterial cells in one gram of soil and one million bacterial cells in a milliliter of fresh water. Altogether, there are about 4 JULI6 x 1030 bacteria and archeaics on Earth, which form biomass that are only exceeded by plants. Bacteria play a major role in the nutrient cycle, such as the nitrogen binding process of the atmosphere and the decomposition of the corpse. In the organism communities around hydrothermal vents and cold vents, extremist bacteria provide the nutrients needed to sustain life by converting the soluted compounds, such as hydrogen sulfide and methane, into energy.

The most common source of deadly bacterial diseases are respiratory infections. Tuberculosis kills about two million people a year, most of which occur in sub-Saharan Africa. Antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections and are also used in agriculture, which makes antibiotic resistance an ongoing problem. In industrialism bacteria play an important role in the treatment of waste and disassemblement of oil spills, the production of cheese and yogurt through fermentation, the purification of gold, palladium, copper, and other metals in mining sectors, as well as in biotechnology and other chemicals. Bacteria are microscopic organisms that make it difficult to detect, especially before a microscope is discovered. This organism was first observed in 1676 by Antony van Leeuwenhoek, a Dutch merchant and scientist. He used a single - lensed microscope designed by himself. Leeuwenhoek then published his observations in a series of letters to the Royal Society of London, which was then published in English in 1684. Bacteria are objects within bounds that are visible to a simple lens of Leeuwenhoek and no one else can see it for more than a century. Leeuwenhoek also observed the protozoa, all of which he referred to as \"little animals.\" Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg, a German scientist, introduced the word Bacterium in 1838.

Gnetophyta is considered the most advanced division of all four divisions in open seed plants. The anatomy structure that approaches flowering plants is in consideration of that. The resemblance lies in the structure of the vessel. Gnetophyta is scattered from desert areas to areas near tropical rain forests. Genus Welwitschia is a relatively well - known desert bush in Africa. A passing meinjo is no different from a flowering plant. Unlike most biological groupings, it is difficult to find many common characteristics among all gnetofits. The two common characteristics that are most commonly used are the presence of special leaves that cover about both ovula and microsporange as well as micropill projections of outer ovula membranes that produce pollinating droplets, although these are very specific compared to those of most other factory divisions.

Intellectual ability is the ability needed to perform various mental activity - thinking, reasoning, and solving problems. Individuals in most societies place intelligence, and for the right reasons, at high value. Intelligent individuals are also more likely to be leaders in a group. The seven most often mentioned dimensions that make up intellectual abilities are: physical abilities are tasks that require stamina, skill, strength, and similar characteristics. Studies on the requirements required in hundreds of jobs have identified the nine basic abilities involved in the performance of physical tasks. Each individual has these basic abilities differently. Certain intellectual or physical abilities needed to do adequate work depend on the requirements of those abilities and jobs. For example, aircraft pilots require strong spatial visualization; coastal guards need strong spatial visualization and good body coordination; senior executives need verbal abilities; and high construction workers need balance. Biographic characteristics are characteristics of individuality - such as age, gender, race, and term - that are easily and objectively obtained from one's personal archives. Relationships between age and performance are likely to be a more important issue over the next decade because there is a broad belief that work performance declines with age; the fact that the work force is aging; and legislation, especially in the U.S., which prohibits retirement orders. Evidence indicates that the best place to start is with the recognition that there are few, if any, significant differences between men and women who influence their performance.",

In some of the incarnations of Vishnu (Awatara) Goddess Lakshmi came into existence as Wedawati and Sita (when Vishnu materialized as Rama), Radha, Rukmini, Satyabama, and Jembatati (when Vishnu materialized as Krishna), and Padmathi (when Vishnu materialized as Venkateswara). Goddess Lakshmi has eight manifestations of herself called Ashta Lakshmi. In the Great embodiment that represents every element of energy and light the universe of the Almighty God. Here is the name of Ashta Lakshmi: Goddess Lakshmi also has an antithesis named Alakhsmi or Jyestha. The alakshmi consists of a word (A) which means no, and Lakshmi who is the goddess of fortune, meaning 'No Lakshmi'. Inversely compared with Lakshmi who was the goddess of prosperity, luck, wealth, and health, Alakshmi was a goddess of bad luck, misfortune, poverty, and misery. Alakshmi or Jyestha are written in the script of Padma Purana and Lingga Purana. In Padma Purana's script, the Alakshmi/Jyestha appears when the event of the ocean is in rotation or controversies (called the Ocean of Manthana), representing the creation of good and evil in the world. Then Alakshmi/Jyestha was assigned to spread crime, sadness and poverty. After Alakshmi was born, there arose Goddess Lakshmi, who was in charge of spreading prosperity and prosperity for the world. In the Lingga Purana script, Vishnu divided the world into good and bad. During the turn of the ocean, Goddess Lakshmi and Alakshmi/Jyestha appeared. Lakshmi was assigned to spread happiness, Alakshmi was assigned to spread suffering. Alakshmi will live among the people of the evil heart and stay away from the religion.",

        "paragraph": "The Democritos Pratamaios was a philosopher who was included in the Mazhab of Atomism. He was a disciple of Leukippos, the founder of the mazhab. Democritos developed the thought of atoms that led to the more well - known Democritos thought in the history of philosophy. Besides being a philosopher, Democritos is also known for mastering many skills. Unfortunately, Democritos' work is not stored. Democritos wrote about science, astronomy, mathematics, literature, epistemology, and ethics. There are about 300 quotes of Democritos' thinking inside ancient sources. Most of those quotes are about ethics. Democritos was born in the city of Abdera, North Greece. He lived about 460 B.C.E. to 370 B.C.E. He came from a wealthy family. When he was young, he used his inheritance to travel to Egypt and other Eastern lands. Besides becoming Leukippos' disciples, he also studied with Anaxagoras and Philolaos. There's little to be known about Democritos' history. A lot of data about his life has been mixed up with legends whose truth is hard to believe. Although he was a contemporary of Socrates, even younger, Democritos was still classified as a pre-socratic philosopher. This is because he went on and developed the teaching of atomicism of Leukippos which is a pre-socratic philosopher. The teachings of Leukippos and Democritos can hardly be separated. Moreover, Democritos philosophy was not known in Athens for long. For example, Plato knew nothing about Atomism. Aristotle then took great note of the view of atomicism. Democritos and his teacher, Leukippos, argue that atoms are the elements that make up reality. Here, they agree with the teaching of Empedocles pluralism and Anaxagoras that reality consists of many elements, not one. However, contrary to Empedocles and Anaxagoras, Democritos thought that these elements could no longer be divided.",

Its size is so small that the human eye cannot see it. Furthermore, atoms also lack quality, such as heat or sweetness. It also distinguishes from the concept of empedocles and seeds of Anaxagoras. The atoms differ from the others through three things: they're like letter A different than N), they're in sequence (like An is different from NA), and they're positioned (A is different from Z in alphabetical order). Thus, atoms have sheer quantity, including mass. The number of atoms that make up this reality is endless. Furthermore, atoms are also viewed as unmade, indestructible, and unchanging. What happens to atoms is motion. Therefore, Democritus stated that \"the fundamental principles of the universe are atoms and voids.\" If there's empty space, then those atoms can move. Democritus compared atomic motion to a situation when sunlight entered a pitch-dark room through the cracks of a window. It'll show how the dust moves through all the directions, even though there's no wind to cause it to move. Thus, it doesn't take any other principle to make the atoms move, like the principles of \"love\" and \"hate\" according to Empedocles. There's enough empty space to make those atoms move. The world and all of reality are created because different atoms are intertwined with each other. The related atoms then start to move around, and the longer the more atoms are involved in that movement. The larger atoms live in the center of the motion, while the finer pieces of atoms are shot to the tip.",

Mary Parker Follet's definition means that a manager is tasked with organizing and directing others to achieve the goals of the organization. Ricky W.

Effective means that goals can be achieved according to planning, while efficient means that existing tasks are carried out properly, organized, and on schedule. Management does not yet have a broad and universally accepted definition. Management is a process of working together with and through others to achieve the organization's goals effectively and efficiently using limited resources in changing environments. The word \"management\" comes from ancient French m\u00e9nagement, which means \"arts carry out and regulate\" This word may come from Italian (1561) maneggiare meaning \"controlling,\" especially in the context of horse control, which comes from Latin manus meaning \"hand.\" French then adopted this word from English to m\u00e9nagement, which has the meaning of the art of carrying out and organizing. There's a lot of difficulty in tracking management history, but it's been known that management science has been around for thousands of years. This is evidenced by the existence of pyramids in Egypt. The pyramid was built by over 100,000 people for 20 years. The Great Pyramid of Giza wouldn't have been built if there wasn't a man in the country who didn't care about what to call the managers, who planned what to do, organized the humans and the materials, led and directed the workers, and enforced certain controls to ensure that everything was done according to plan.",

The people of Venice developed an early form of business companies and engaged in many of the activities that are common in modern organizations today. For example, in Venice's armory, warships were launched along canals; at each stop, raw materials and sails were added to the ship. It's similar to the model of the assembly line developed by Henry Ford to assemble his cars. In addition to the assembly line, the Venetians had storage and storage systems to monitor their contents, human resources management to manage the workforce, and accounting systems to track income and cost. Daniel Wren divided the evolution of management in four phases, which is early thinking, the age of science management, the era of social man, and the modern era. Before the 20th century, there were two major events in management science. The first event occurred in 1776, when Adam Smith published a classic economic doctrine, The Wealth of Nation. In his book, he put out economical advantages that organizations will obtain from the division of labor, which is job details into specific and repetitive tasks. By using the pin factory industry as an example, Smith said that with ten or one of each of them doing special jobs the safety pin company could produce about 48,000 pins a day. However, if everyone is working alone to finish each part of the job, it would be great if they could produce twenty pins a day. Smith concluded that the division of work can increase productivity by (1) the increase in skills and concentrations of each worker, (2) save time spent on task change, and (3) create machines and other inventions that can save labor.",

Like other interconnected geological periods, such as the soil layer that determines the beginning and end of this period is well identified, but the date has exactly 5-10 million years of uncertainty. The beginning of the Silang period was determined on a major extinction event when 60% of the marine species were destroyed. During the early Silang period, the dominant fauna community came from a group of Pentamerus yaotu brachiopods (lightbacks) of the species Pentamerus oblongus. This community is known to live in sun - exposed areas of water because they are associated with strong chalked green algae. Waters occupied are areas with stable wave activity and not too shallow, because pentamerid brakiopods will lose pedicles as adults. The pentamerid community thrived at a depth of maybe 30 to 60 meters (100 to 200 feet). In this period (some other references say that this occurred during the Ordovicium period), for the first time, non-microbial organisms rose to land, in the form of moss colonies growing near wet areas like rivers and lakes.

Most chromosomes on the eukaryota have a packaging protein called histon which, assisted by a companion protein, binds and compresses DNA molecules to maintain their integrity. These chromosomes feature complex three - dimensional structures, which play an important role in transcription regulations. Chromosomes are usually seen under the microscope of light only during metaphase in cell division (when all chromosomes line up in the middle of the cell in compact or condensed form). Before this happens, each chromosome is duplicated (S) and both copies are combined by centromeres to form an X-shaped structure (if the centromere is located on the equitator) or form a two-arm structure (if the centromere is located on the edge). These combined copies are now called sister chromatids. During metaphase, X-shaped structures are called metaphase chromosomes that are so compact that they are easily distinguished and studied. In animal cells, chromosomes reach the highest embedment when anaphase during the segregation process of chromosomes. The recombination of chromosomes during meiosis and sexual reproduction play an important role in genetic diversity. If chromosomes are manipulated incorrectly, through a process known as instability and translocation of chromosomes, cells can experience a catastrophic mitosis. Normally, this will cause the cell to start the apoptosis that causes its own death, but sometimes the mutations in the cell inhibit this process and cause the development of cancer. Some people use chromosome terms in a broader sense, to refer to the individual parts of the chromatin in the cell, both visible and invisible under the microscope of light. Others use the concept of chromosomes in a narrower sense to refer to individual parts of the chromatin during cell division, which is seen under the microscope of light because of high condensation.",

German scientists Schleiden, Virchow, and B\u00fctschli were among the first scientists to recognize the structure now known as chromosomes. In a series of experiments that began in the mid-the 1880s, Theodor Boveri made a definite contribution to explaining that chromosomes are vectors that contribute to heredity, with two notions that are then known as chromosome connections and 'individuality chromosomes'. Wilhelm Roux argued that each chromosome carries a different genetic configuration, and Boveri was able to test and confirm this hypothesis. Helped by rediscovery in the early 1900s of Gregor Mendel's early work, Boveri could show the relationship between the rules of inheritance and the behavior of chromosomes. Boveri influenced two generations of American siturologists: Edmund Beecher Wilson, Nettie Stevens, Walter Sutton, and TheophilusPainter; all influenced by Boveri (Wilson, Stevens, andPainter actually worked with him). In his famous textbook, the Cell in Development and Heredity, Wilson associated Boveri and Sutton's independent works (both around 1902) by naming chromosome inheritance theory Boveri-Sutton chromosome theory. Ernst Mayr commented that the theory was hotly debated by some well - known geneticists: William Bateson, Wilhelm Johannsen, Richard Goldschmidt, and T.H.

MESFET is almost similar to JFET in terms of construction and terminology, the difference is MESFET does not use p-n connections as gates but uses Schottky metal conductors. MESFETs are usually made in compound semiconductor technology to reduce high-quality approximators such as arsenid gallium (Gaas), indium phosphide (InP), or Silicon carbide (SIC). MESFETs are faster, but they are also more expensive than silicon - based JFETs or MOSFETs. MESFETs can be used at approximately 30 GHz frequencies, and are usually used for microwave and radar frequency communication. For the use of digital circuitry, it's very difficult to use MESFET for the basis of digital integrated circuitry because its proportions continue to increase, and its no better quality than the CMOS-based production. MESFET differs from FET conventional insulated gates because there are no insulators under the gates in active sweep areas. This shows that the MESFET gate must be planted so that no semiconductor semiconductor semiconductive metals will advance but that the poor return zone will control the existing canals. Although these restrictions interfere with several possible usages, the analog and digital MESFET device works well if it is held at design limits. The most critical aspect of design is the metal gate that stretches through the breaching area. Basically, the narrower the delivery canals are modulated the gate, the better the frequency handling ability. Separating the source with the cerat according to the gate and the range to the side of the gate is important even though it is not a critical design parameter. MESFET stream handling capabilities improved as gates elongated to the side, keeping the active area constant, but limited by the shifting phase along the gate due to the effects of transmission path.",

After being thought to be found only in eukaryota cells, cytoskeletons can also be found in procariota cells. By means of cytoskeletons, cells can have solid shapes, shape changes, control of organelle positions, swim, and crawl across the surface. The cytoskeleton eukariota consists of three basic types, which are microfilamen, microtubules, and intermediates. These three filaments are connected to each other and coordinated. It is flexible, the actin filament is usually the shape of a net or gel. Actins function as cell surfaces. Some strains of bacteria are also able to move with actin filament, such as the monocytogenes, which spread from cell to cell by inducing the building of actin filament in the host cell cytosol. Microtubulas or microtubules are tubes arranged from microtubulins. It's more solid than the actin, the microtubules regulate the organelle position inside the cell. Microtubulus has two ends: negative ends connected to the microtubulic control center, and positive ends that are near the plasma membrane. Organels can glide along microtubules to reach different positions in cells, especially when cell division. Tubulins can be polymerized into microtubules. Polymerization experiments can be made with a mixture of tubulin, buffer solution, and GTP at 37 \u00b0C temperatures. In its phase, the number of microtubules is following the sigmoid curve. In the lag phase, each molecule of tubulin is associated to form a somewhat stable aggregate. Some of these continue to form microtubules. When integeration, each subunit binds to the tip of the microtubulus. During the plato phase, (i.e. the log phase on cell division), polymerization and depolimerization took place evenly because the number of free tubularins there was a fitting fit. Fiberlike ropelike fibers, intermediate filaments give cells mechanical strength so that cells are resistant to the pressure and stretching that occur on cell walls.",

This disparaged the tetramer to be associated with another tetramer. In the end, tetramer-tetramer joins to form a helix array. With just three types of filaments, cell structure can vary from cell to cell. The third working effectiveness of this protein filament depends on the number of ascesory proteins that connect filaments to other cell components. The essential ascessory protein controls the assembly of cytoskeleton filaments at a certain position, including motor proteins that shift the organelle in the filament or filament itself. This arrangement of filaments resembles rows of ants. Tied up and if anyone leaves the group, the line can reconstitute at high speeds. Silia is the .25-size thin thread with a microtubulus bundle at its core. The walls of the silia are 9 pairs of microtubules and the middle of these threads are two non-gained microtubules, commonly called axoneme. This structure is often referred to as \"Structure 9+2.\" Silia operates fluid on the surface of the cell and moves cells inside the fluid. Centriol is a tube - shaped structure formed from a microtubulus with a width of 0.2 \u25aam and a length of 0.4 \u25aam. Centriol acts as a spindle thread to separate chromosomes. Microtubules group together to form three microtubules arranged parallelly. Nine such groups form a centriole wall. Each group is not perpendicular to the tube core, but it's slightly tilted.

There are corrosive substances that have chemical properties that help to extend the corosivity.

The Fiji Islands Republic is an island nation south of the Pacific Ocean, east of Vanuatu, west of Tonga, and south of Tuvalu. Fiji has 322 islands, 106 of which are inhabited. There are also 522 small islands. The two largest islands are Viti Levu and Vanua Levu, the residents covering 82% of the country's entire population. The Fiji name is an ancient word in Tonga for the islands, which in turn comes from the Fijian name Viti. The capital of Fiji, Suva, is located on this island. In Fiji many immigrants come from India/Pakistan. The first Fijians arrived from Southeast Asia long before any contact with European explorers in the 17th century. The academic issue of Pacific migration is still unsolved. It is noted that Fiji was discovered by Dutch explorer Abel Tasman when he sought to locate the Great South Continent in 1643. But it wasn't until the 19th century that Europeans arrived at the Fiji Islands to settle there permanently. The islands fell into the hands of Britain as a colony in 1874. In 1970, Fiji gained its independence. The democratic government was interrupted by two military coups in 1987, concerned that the government at that time would be dominated by the Indo-Fiji (India) community. The result of the second coup in 1987 was that Britain's monarchy was abolished, the governor general was replaced by a non-exclusive Fiji President, and the country's old name was changed from the Fiji Republic to the Fiji Republic (then turned into the Fiji Islands Republic in 1997). A 1990 constitution guarantees Fijiian ethnic domination of power in Fiji, but this causes large emigration of Indian descent; it causes economic hardship, but guarantees that the Melanesian nation will be the majority.",

The island of Viti Levu is the capital of the state of Suva, where 3/4 of the people of this country live here. The island has many mountains, with its highest point 1200 meters above sea level. Around the island are tropical forests. Another important city is Nadi, where international airports and Lautoka are located. The important city of Vanua Levu is Labasa and Savusavu. The other islands are Taveuni and Kadavu Islands, the third and fourth largest islands, the Mamanuca Islands (outside of Nadi) and the Yasawa Islands, which are tourist destinations.

Seismology contributes important to data and information for the structure of the building in the engineering of the building and the inner structure of the Earth. Seismology comes from two Greek words, the seismos meaning vibrations or shakes and logos meaning tracts or science. The Greeks called the earthquake a seismos ges test, which means the Earth is shaking or shaking. Thus, simply seismology can be interpreted as a study of the earth's vibration phenomena, or simply put, the science of earthquakes. Seismology is part of geophysical science. Seismology is divided into global seismology and exploration. The great earthquake that occurred on November 1, 1755, in Lisboa, Portugal destroyed an entire city and triggered a massive tsunami, which can be recorded as the first trigger for the development of modern seismology. Needs reference. Seismology is not just studying earthquakes. Hydrocarbon exploration (earth oil and gas) was also started by a seismic survey. For this purpose, the vibration triggers are made by humans (not earthquakes) using some kind of dynamite, and then the vibrations that can be received some recipients are arranged in such a way that they can describe underground conditions. Need references] Absorption factors are the nature of subtraction of an undimensional energy or absopration. An absorption factor is likened to a quality factor. Another name is a specific absorption factor or a specific reduction factor. According to its generalization, the reduction of materials occurs when the value of an absorption factor in an infinite value. The value of the absorption factor is determined by the comparison between the response of the slide wave material with the response of the disassociated longitional wave material.",

Seismology uses seismic events that produce low-frequency R waves for Earth's interior imaging. While R waves with middle frequencies are used to know the characteristics of the land. Seismology that produces R waves with these middle frequencies is used in geophysics and geotechnical techniques. The geometric dispersion of R waves is used as a base of seismic methods. The imaging results were recorded using inversion solutions with seismic data as a database. Recording was done to both the source of active waves and the source of passive waves. Imaging can also be done using microtremors. Seismology is one of the areas in which the Earthology is combined by geology and geophysics used in human adaptation with nature. This adaptation is reviewed in terms of knowledge and technology. Seismology uses a computerized tomography scanning technique adopted from medical science to imaging subsurface structures using earthquake wave data. This imaging technique is used in codectering research for human anatomy imaging. In seismology, this adoption technique is called seismic tomography. Images using seismic tomography techniques can provide detailed information about the interior structure of the Earth. This is one of the advantages of a source of seismic information in energy carried by earthquake waves from earthquake centers to all parts of the earth through the mediums it passes. The seismograph is a tool used by seismologists to know the extent of the damage caused by the earthquake. It's capable of recording the result of an earthquake wave on the Earth's surface. The seismograph was first made by Chinese astronomer Zhang Heng. Modern seismographs use electronic systems.

However, all Christians believe that Jesus is the Messiah (or Christ/Almiah, all of which literally means \"Anointed One\") that is awaited in the Old Testament. Almost all academics agree that Jesus existed historically, e] and historians consider the Gospel of Synoptic (Mattius, Mark, and Luke) the best source to study Jesus ' history. Most academics agree that Jesus was a Galileeian, a Jewish rabbi who preached his message orally, was baptized by John the Baptist, and was crucified according to Roman Prefect Pontius Pilate. In view of the current mainstream, Jesus is an apocalyptic evangelist and founder of an update movement in Judaism. After his death, his followers believed that Jesus rose from the dead, and the community they formed later became the Christian Church. The most common calendar era, for \"M\" (Masehi) in English or \"AD\" of Latin \"Anno Domini\" (\"in the year of our Lord\"), is based on the birth of Jesus.

There are four living filum deuterostomias: Filum Chaetognatha (arrow worms) may also belong here. An extinct group may be Vetulicolia. Echinodermata, Hemichordata and Xenoturbellida formed an Ambulacraria class. Both deuterostomia and prototomia, the first zygote formed a hollow cell sphere called a blastula. In deuterostomia, early division occurs parallel or perpendicular to the polar axis. It's called radial division, and it also happens in some protostomies like lophophorata. A lot of deuterostomia suggests non-decisive division, which would be what a cell is not determined by the identity of a stem cell. So if the first four cells are separated, each cell is able to form a complete larva, as well as a cell removed from the blastula, another cell will replace it. In deuterostomia, mesoderm is formed as a growing intestinal protrusion that sharpens, forming a coelom. It's called yourocoeli. Hemichordata and Chordata have gills gaps, and primitive echinodermic fossils also show the presence of gills. The inner nerve cord was found in all the chordata, including the tunikata (in the larval stage). Some hemichordata also have tubular nerve cords.

The initial point of this period was not officially recognized by the International Commission on Stratography, but it was usually thought to have lasted 3.8 billion years ago, at the end of the Hadean eon. Arkean consists of four eras, in a row of the earliest: Eoarkean, Paleearkean, Mesoarkean, and Neoarkean. This Eon is marked by the emergence of the first sediment rock, the emergence of life, in the form of procaritata such as phanobacterial, and the actuality. Archean rock samples that survived to this day are mostly frozen rocks, volcanic rocks, and metamorphics. Volcanic activity. By the time this eon started, the Earth's heat flow was three times stronger than it is now. The height of the Earth's coat flow is estimated to cause the movement of the Earth's plate to grow faster and stronger. Still, scientists do not know for certain when plate tectonics first appeared. To be sure, the Vaalbara Supercontinent was formed on this eon. Earth's atmosphere currently forms largely from methane and carbon dioxide. The layer on the coast of the above illustration is the stromatolit, which is formed by the phenobacterial, which is the first living organism to develop photosynthesis, and releases oxygen as waste gas. This stromatolit was often found at 3.5 billion years ago. The oxygen released by the phenobacterial will be mixed with the iron in the air, which will then form a circled iron formation. At the beginning of this eon, the Earth's heat flow was almost three times higher than it is now, and it's still twice the current rate at the transition from Arkean to Proterozoic (2,500 Ma). Extra heat is the result of the remaining heat mixtures of the planet's mass additions, of the formation of metal nuclei, and of the decaying of radioactive elements.",

At the end of this eon roughly 2,500 Ma, plate tectonic activity may be similar to that of the modern Earth. There are well-guarded sedimentic basins, and evidences of volcanic bows, intracontinental rifts, collisions of continents, and orogenic events that extend around the world that indicate the unity and separation of one and perhaps several supercontinents. Evidence of twisted iron formations, routing layers, chemical sediments, and pillow basalts indicates that many liquid water is found and deep ocean basins already exist. asteroid collisions often occur in the beginning of Arkean. Arkean atmosphere is estimated to have almost a shortage of free oxygen. Astronomers think that the Sun has approximately 70-75 percent of the current luminosity, but temperatures on Earth seem to be approaching a modern level only 500 million years after the formation of the Earth.

The commercially sold hydrogen peroxide is a dilute solution that contains a little stabilizer, in glass bottles or polyethylene to lower decomposition levels. 6% (\"w/v\") hydrogen peroxide can damage the skin, causing white boils caused by oxygen bubbles. In organic chemistry peroxide is a functional cluster of an organic molecule that contains a single bond of oxygen-oxygen (R-O-O-R').

From an etymology angle, the word Cnidaria comes from the Greek \"cnidos\" meaning \"spit jar.\" It's cnidaria's stinging ability that's the origin of their names. The signature of Cnidaria is knidocyte, which is the specialized cell they use primarily to catch prey and defend themselves. Their body consists of mesoglea, a jellylike lifeless substance, located between two layers of epitelium that are usually as thick as one cell. They have two basic forms of body: a self-swimming medusia and a cesspool of polyps, both radial symmetrical with their mouths surrounded by symmetrical tentacles. Both forms have digestive and respiratory cavity, and a hole that serves as both a mouth and anus. Many cnidaria produce colonies that are single organisms made up of zoid. For a long time, Cnidaria was grouped with Ctenophora in the Coelenterata filum, but after their differences began to be realized, they were placed on separate filums. Cnidaria is classified as four main groups: Sensational Anthozoa consists of sea anemones, corals, and sea pens, Scyphozoa, Cubozoa (box jellyfish) and hydrozoa, a body of multiorganism made up of all the cnifada and some species of seawater. Other groups of animals are also considered separate classes such as Staurozoa and Myxozoa and Polypodioa (both parasites). Cnidaria forms animal filums that are more complex than sponges, almost a complex ctenophora, and less complex than any other animal, which consists of almost any other animal.

Like sponges and ctenophora, cnidaria has two major cell layers that flank the central layer of jelly called mesoglea in cnidara; more complex animals have three major cell layers and no jagged layer of jelly. Hence, cnidaria and ctenophora are referred to as diploblastic along with sponges. Adult Cnidaria has two basic forms: Medusa that can swim freely (motil) and Polip that adhere to substrates (sessil). Both forms have radial symmetry. The animal has no head and its mouth and anus lies in the same hole, the side near its mouth is called a oral and is called an aboral instead. Cnidaria has tentacles full of knidocytes on its side. Some hydrozoa are made up of zooid colonies that have various functions, such as defenses and hunting prey. Mesoglea polyps are usually thin and soft, while medusa has a thick, elastic mesoglea, which allows medusa to glide in the water and form itself again. On the medusa, the only support of the body is mesoglea. Polyps like Hydra and most marine anemones cover their mouths when they are not eating, and the water in their body cavity acts as a hydrostatic skeleton, similar to a balloon filled with water. Other polyps such as Tubularia use a pile of water - filled cells as supports. Coral secretes the outer skeleton (exoskeleton) of calcium carbonate.

Bread includes basic food in many Western and Middle East countries. Bread is the basis of pizza and the outer layer of sandwich. Bread is usually sold in sliced form, and it is in fresh, well - packed plastic conditions. In some cultures bread is viewed as so important that it becomes part of religious rituals. Bread is the oldest processed food in the world. Evidence from 30,000 years ago in Europe showed flour residue on the surface of the rock used to pound food. It was likely by then that flour had already begun to be extracted from bulbs, such as Typhas and nail plants. The flour was spread over a flat rock, burned with fire, becoming a primitive flatbread. About 10,000 B.C.E., with the emergence of neolithium and the development of agriculture, grains became the main ingredient of bread. The yeast seed is unknown, so the dough expands naturally, without much human interference. There were several sources of bread development techniques at first. The leaven in the air can be obtained by allowing immature dough to be exposed to air some time before cooking. Pliny the Elder reports that the Gauls and the Iberians used diskim beer called barm to make lighter bread than people used to make.

Usually it's about 0.5 millimeters long (0.020 in), they're filtering filters that filter food particles from water using a retractable lofophor, a tentacle coated with silia. Most marine species live in tropical waters, but some live in ocean mangers, and others found in polar waters. One class only lives in a variety of freshwater environments, and some members of the class mostly prefer brackish water. More than 4,000 known living species. One genus is solitary and the rest is colonial. This filum was originally called \"Polyzoa,\" but this term was replaced by \"Bryozoa\" in 1831. Another group of animals were discovered later, the filter mechanisms looked similar, also included in \"Bryozoa\" to 1869, when two groups were known to be very different internally. The newly discovered group was named Entoprocta, while the original \"Bryozoa\" was called \"Ectorocta.\" However, \"Bryozoa\" is still a more widely used term for the second group. Individuals in the Briozoa colony are called zooid, since they are not fully independent animals. All colonies contain autozooids, responsible for eating and excretion. Colonies of several classes have different types of zooid non-eating specialists, some of which are fertilized egg hatching sites, and some classes also have special zoids to defend the colony. Cheilostomata classes have the largest number of species, probably because they have the widest range of zoid specialists. Some species can creep very slowly using thorny defensive zooids as legs.

Zooid has no special excretion organs, and polypide of autozooids is released when polypide becomes full of waste products; usually the body walls then grow a replacement polypide. In the autozooid the intestine is shaped U, with the mouth inside the \"contaminate\" of the tentacles and outer anus. The colony takes many forms, including fans, bushes and sheets. Cheilostomata produces mineralized exoskeletons and forms one-layer sheets that line up the surface. Zooid of all freshwater species is simultaneous hermaphrodit. Although zooids of many marine species serve as males first and then as females, their colonies always contain combinations of zooids that are in the male and female stages. All species emit sperm into the water. Some also release ovum into the water, while others capture sperm through their tentacles to fertilize their ovum internally. On some species of larvae have large egg yolks, go to feed, and quickly settle on the surface. Others produce larvae that have little yolk but swim and eat for a few days before settling. After settling, all the larvae have radical metamorphosis that destroys and rebuilds virtually every internal network. Freshwater species also produce dorman statoblas until conditions allow, which allow colony offspring to survive even if severe conditions kill mother colonies. Predators from the brizoa of the sea include nudibranchia (sea snails), fish, sea porcupines, pycnogonide, crustaceans, mites and starfish.

Being thankful and doing good is one way that life will be calmer and happier. Various approachs of philosophy, religion, psychology, and biology have been made to define happiness and determine its source. Religious philosophers and thinkers have often defined happiness in connection with a good life and not just an emotion. This definition is used to translate eudaimonia and is still used in the theory of goodness. Although direct measurements of happiness are still a challenge, some researchers have developed a tool to do so, for example with The Oxford Happiness Questionnaire. Researchers have also identified some things related to happiness: relationships and social interactions, marital status, employment, health, freedom of democracy, optimism, religious involvement, income, receiving gifts and closeness to other happy people. Happiness has many different definitions and debates in its meaning and use. It is widely used to relate to two factors: feelings and emotions that affect, such as pleasure or excitement, and assessment of quality of life. In its use can include both factors. A measure of well - being can include what is being felt at present (emotion, mood, living and feeling). A female professor named Sonja Lyumboirsky has described happiness as experience, excitement, satisfaction, or positive circumstances, combined with the feeling that one's life is good, meaningful and precious.

Unfortunately, if people focus too much on pursuing something that's external, long-term benefits of happiness can't be gained. We can actually hurt our happiness, because we'll always want more and never really be satisfied,\" adds Benton. As the solution to helping us feel happier overall, researchers suggest five things that can be done, among other things: the simpler one's need for happiness, the more likely that person is to be happy. This type of happiness can be difficult for anyone to maintain because of its inconsistent nature, causing people to find it very difficult to feel happy in life: Anyone who compares his life with that of others will never feel happy. It's hard to be content with everyday life when it's constantly looking at it through the lens of other people's experiences. The comparison that grows dissatisfaction always sees those who have more and achieve higher rates of success but rarely compares with those who may not have or do many things. People who cannot see or take responsibility for the way they contribute to conflicts in their lives, often suffer in relationships, especially close relationships where challenges cannot be avoided. These people feel that something is happening to them, and they have no awareness of how they might have triggered or triggered a situation that makes them feel unhappy. In their world, it seems that everything is someone else's fault. Yes, it is true that in a conflict of relationships, actions and words a person may have greater consequences than others, but this is a rare situation when a person is completely innocent.",

This increase has caused the heart to have to work harder than usual to circulate blood through the veins. Blood pressure involves two measurements, systolic and diastolic, depending on whether the heart muscle is contracted or performs between the pulses. The normal blood pressure at break time is in the systolic range of 100 JU140 mmHg and diastolic (low reading) 60 considered 90 mmHg. High blood pressure happens when it's constantly at 140/90 mmHg or more. The hypertension is divided into primary hypertension or secondary hypertension. About 80?95% of cases are \"private hypertension,\" which means high blood pressure without a clear medical cause. Other conditions affecting kidneys, arteries, heart, or endocrine systems cause 5-10% of other cases. Hypertension is a major risk factor for strokes, myocard infarcs, heart failure, arterial aneurysms (e. g. aneurism aorta), peripheral arterial disease, and the cause of chronic kidney disease. Even an increase in arterial blood pressure is associated with shorter life expectancy. Change in diet and lifestyle can improve blood pressure control and reduce risk related to health complications. Even so, medicine is often needed in some people if a life - style change has proved ineffective or inadequate and usually needs to be taken for life until the doctor decides it is no longer necessary to take medication. A person who has experienced high blood pressure, under normal conditions may experience blood pressure again and this is something to be aware of, many cases of strokes occur when a person is off the medication.

If measurements are obtained from 24-hour ambulatory or home surveillance monitoring, they are used lower bounds (systolic 135 mmHg or 85 mmHg diastolic). Some recent international guidelines on hypertension have also made a category below the hypertension range to show the continued risk of higher blood pressure than the normal range.

After the Spanish Civil War, Franco's dictatorship adopted repressive action, eliminating Catalan institutions and legally banned Catalan use. From the late 1950s to the early 1970s, Catalonia saw rapid economic growth, attracting workers from all over Spain, making Barcelona one of the largest metropolitan industries in Europe and turning Cat Squareya into a major tourist destination.

Liverpool's original street plan was said to have been designed by King John almost at the same time as the royal charter, making it a borough. When trade from the West Indies, including sugar, transcended Ireland and Europe, and when the Dee River continued to narrow, Liverpool began to grow at increasing speeds. The first commercial wet dock was built in Liverpool in 1715. In the early 19th century, large numbers of trades passed through the city of Liverpool, and the construction of large buildings reflected the wealth of this city. In 1830 Liverpool and Manchester became the first cities to have cross - city railways, through Liverpool and Manchester Railway. Population continued to rise rapidly, especially during the 1840s when hundreds of thousands of Irish migrants began to come from the Great Hunger. Early in 1851, Liverpool was nicknamed \"The New York of Europe.\" During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Liverpool lured immigrants from all over Europe. This resulted in the construction of various religious buildings in cities for new ethnic and religious groups in the city, many of which are still in use. During World War II, Liverpool's critical strategic interests were recognized by Hitler and Churchill. The city was bombed out by the Germans, experiencing a second lightning attack after London. Luftwaffe did 80 air raids on Merseyside, killing 2,500 people and causing nearly half the homes in the metropolitan region to be damaged.

In some cultures, when compared with other weapons, the sword usually has a higher or higher prestige. Swordbars are usually made of hard metal such as iron or steel. Although there was a golden sword, it was used only as an ornament. For practice, usually a wooden sword that is used, although a hard wooden sword is still dangerous. The same weapons as swords and spears that used obsidian blades were used by native tribes of Central America and South America that at the time of European colonization did not know metal. Humans have made and used sword - bearing weapons from the beginning of the Bronze Age. The sword developed from the dagger when making the sword becomes possible, about two millenniums before the mass. The sword is over 1.5 meters long and very unusual and is not used in bronze times because its length reduces the power of bronze. Not until a stronger metal like steel makes a long sword used in battle. Khopes measured only 50 to 60 centimeters of bronze as well. The hilt of the sword initially made it possible for a strong grip, and prevented the possibility of a hand slipping while plunging to the target. The bronze sword first appeared with a leaflike shape around the middle sea and the black sea, and in Mesoppotamia. Swords from the nordic bronze age about 1400 B.C.E. indicate characteristics of spiral patterns. The production of swords in China dates back to the Shang Dynasty. The iron sword experienced an increase in use in the 13th century B.C.E.

Then the forgers learned that adding a number of carbons (infused in the form of a rock) into iron, they could make better metal (now known as \"irrest\"). Some different methods of swordmaking have existed in the past, including, most famous, pattern formation. In turn, different methods developed around the world. By the time they entered the classic age of antiques and the Parthias and Sassanids in Iran, the iron sword had become common. Xiphos of greek and Gladius of Rome is a type of example, with a length of 6'4,\" 4'4.\" The Roman Empire finally introduced Spatha to its wearer (a term for its wearer, spatharius, the royal rank of Constantinople), and from that point on, the term \"long sword \" was addressed to a sword that included length in this period. The Chinese steel sword appeared during the 3rd century B.C. the Qin Dynasty. Dao of China (piyin d\u0101o) is a one-edged sword, sometimes translated as a sabre or broadsword, and Jian (piyin ji\u0101n) with two eyes.

They handle services from transportation, hospitality, shelter, food, drink and services such as banks, insurance, security etc. And it also offers places of rest, culture, escape, adventure, new experiences and other differences. Many countries depend largely on this tourism industry as a tax and revenue source for companies that sell services to tourists. This development of the tourism industry is therefore one of the strategies used by the Non-Government Organization to promote certain areas as tourist areas to increase commerce through sales of goods and services to non-local people. According to the No.10/2009 Act of Tourism, which refers to tourism: Tourism is a wide range of tourist activities supported by various facilities and services provided by the community, businessmen, Government and State. The word tourism comes from the Sanskrit word \"pari\" and \"traveling.\" Literally, tourism means \"a trip that's been made many times somewhere. The tourist industry can be interpreted as a collection of businesses that produce various services and goods needed by those who travel on tour. According to S.

The disease is caused by various strains of mikobakteria, generally Mycobacterium tuberculosis (short for \"MTb\" or \"MTbc\"). Tuberculosis usually attacks the lungs, but it can also affect other body parts. Tuberculosis spreads through the air when someone with an active TB infection coughs, sneezes, or spreads their spitlets through the air. Major TB infections are nonresident and latent. However, one in ten cases of latent infection developed into active disease (TB is active). If tuberculosis is not treated, more than 50% of the infected could die. Before the discovery of powerful antibiotics for TB (about 1900 in the early days), it was estimated that 1 in 7 people in the world died from this disease. The classic symptoms of TB infection are chronic coughs with sputum or phlegm, fever, night sweat, and weight loss. It's called \"consumption\" because infected people tend to lose weight. Infections in other organs cause symptoms of various kinds. Active TB diagnosis depends on radiology (usually through chest X - rays) and physical examination and microbiological culture. Meanwhile, a latent TB diagnosis depends on a test of skin tuberculosis and blood tests. An active treatment requires giving some antibiotics regularly within a period of 6 to 12 months. People who make contact also have to undergo an impairment test and be treated if necessary. With the current development of the antibiotics, the well-done treatment of TB will improve the recovery rate above 90 %.",

To prevent TB, everyone had to undergo a test of the disease and obtain the Calmette Calmette C\u00e9\u00e9rin's vaccines. Experts believe that a third of the world's population has been infected by M. tuberculosis, and new infections occur at one person per second. By 2007, an estimated 13.7 million chronic cases were active at a global level. In 2010, an estimated 8.8 million new cases were raised, and 1.5 million deaths occurred in the developing world. The absolute number of tuberculosis cases has begun to decline since 2006, while new cases have begun to decline since 2002. Tuberculosis does not spread evenly around the world. From the populations in various countries in Asia and Africa that did the tuberculosis test, 80% of them showed positive results, while in the United States, only 510% showed positive results.

In addition to plants, some mushroom hifas are also known to produce viscous fluid similar to latex. In plants, latex is produced by cells that form an individual vessel, called latex vessels. These cells are around the tapis (floem) and have many nuclei and produce tiny latex grains in the cytosol. If the tissue of these cell vessels opens, for example, because of the stimuli, there will be a process of releasing these grains into vessels and coming out as a viscous sap. The latex is made up of rubber particles and non-rabbers that are disseminated in the water. Latex is also a coloid solution with rubber particles and not rubbers suspended within a media containing a variety of substances. Inside the latex contains 25-40% of raw rubber (crude rubber) and 6075% of the serum consisting of water and dissolved substances. Raw rubber material contains 9095% pure rubber, 2-3% protein, 1-2% fatty acid, 0.2% sugar, 0.5% salt from Na, K, Mg, Cn, Cu, Mn and Fe. The rubber particles are suspended or spread evenly in latex serum sizes 0.04-3.00 microns with round particles to ovals. Latex is a complex emulsion that contains proteins, alkaloids, starches, sugars, (poli) pens, oil, tanin, resins, and goms. Many latex plants are usually white, but some are yellow, orange, or red. The structure of latex materials can be divided into two components. The first component is a disseminated part or emitted an evenly contained material called a serum.

The relatively small amount of non - rubber material has an important role in controlling the stability of latex and rubber properties. The latex is a colossal suspension of the water and chemicals contained in it. And what they contain is not perfect, but they're dispersed homogenically or evenly in the water. The rubber particles inside the latex lie nowhere near each other, but stay away from each other because each particle has an electrical charge. The force that resists this electrical charge creates a brown movement. Inside the latex, the isoprene is covered with a protein layer so that the plant's electrical - charged rubber particles will clot or freeze naturally within hours of its collection. Natural or spontaneous clotging can be caused by the emergence of acids caused by the disintegration of non-strutted material found in latex as a result of microorganism activity. It also causes the natural clotting to stink. In addition, clotting is also caused by the emergence of anion from lipid hydrolysisic fatty acids found in latex. This fat acid anion will react with magnesium and calcium ions in latex to form unsurpassed soap, both of which cause latex impurities that eventually freeze. Events like this usually happen when latex is in the tank during the transport to the processing plant. The results of precoagulation can only be treated as low - quality rubbers like the rubber crumbs of SIR 10 and SIR 20. Pracoagulation can occur because of the coloidal stability contained in latex is reduced because of bacterial activity, shock and environmental temperatures that are too high.",

Medical diagnosis can be performed if a person has a desire to live and is accepted as a person with the sex they identify or if he is disturbed and has difficulty in everyday activities. Norman Haure wrote in 1921 about Dora R. from Germany who began a surgical transition under Magnus Hirschfeld and was completed in 1930 with a successful redetermination operation. Hirschfeld was also involved in the 1930s operation of the second genitalal redetermination of the Elbe Lili of Denmark to be documented and reported in scientific journals. Then in 1923, Hirschfeld introduced transsexualism terms that were introduced by David Oliver Cauldwell into English transsexualism and transsexualism in 1949 and 1950.

Benjamin then continued by popularizing the term in his 1996 book The Transsexual Phenomenon.

Reformed theology was developed by theologys such as Martin Bucer, Heinrich Bulllinger, Peter Martyr Vermigli, and Huldrych Zwingli and also influenced by British reformers such as Thomas Cranmer and John Jewel.

This work experienced a number of revisions in its lifetime, including impressive translations into everyday French. Through the Institute of Institution along with the polymics and Calvin shepherding work, its contributions to confederate documents to be used in churches, and its vast contributions in the form of Biblical interpretations, Calvin had a great personal influence on Protestantism.

The word tetanus is derived from the Greek tetanos of the teinein, which means straining. This disease is an infection during tonic and hyperreflexic muscle spasme causes trismus (lockjaw), common muscle spasme, curvature of the back (opistotocnus), global spasme, seizures, and respiratory parasisia. C. tetany is included in positive Gram bacteria, obligate anaerobs, can form spores, and drumsticks. The spores created by C. tetani are very resistent to heat and antiseptic. It can endure despite being exposed (1210C, 1015 minutes) and also resistent against phenol and other chemical agents. The bacteria of Clostridium tetanim is found largely on the soil, human waste and pets and in agricultural areas. For the most part, the bacteria spore is distributed to the soil and to the treatment channels and to the feses of horses, sheep, dogs, cats, rats, pigs, and chickens. When the bacteria are inside the body, it will produce neurotoxins. C. tetanys produce two exotoxins, which are tetanolysin and tetanospasmin. The function of tetanolysin is unknown, but it can also affect tetanus. Tetanospasmin is a pretty powerful toxin. Tetanus is caused by neurotoxins (thetanospasmin) from anaerob positive graph bacteria, Clostridium tethy, first of all 1 to 2 weeks after inoculating the form of spores into the injured body's blood.",

In anaerobic conditions, these bacteria spores will become vegetative cells. Next, toxins will be produced and spread throughout the body through circulation and spleen systems. The toxin will work on certain places like the center of the nervous system including the brain. The chronic symptoms caused by the toxin are to block the release of neurotransmitters, resulting in uncontrolled muscle contractions. The result of tetanus is the rigid paralysis in voluntary muscles, often called lockjaw because it usually first appears in jaw and facial muscles. Death is usually caused by respiratory failure and the death ratio is very high. To neutralize the poison, given immunoglobulin tetanus. Antibiotic tetracyccline and penicillin were given to prevent further toxins from forming, so that the existing toxins died. Other medications can be given to calm sufferers, control seizures and relax muscles. Sufferers are usually hospitalized and placed in a quiet room.

Kangsa, the sister of Godki, was afraid of a prophecy saying that she would be killed at the hands of the eighth son of Godki. That's why he threw Desaki and her husband into prison and killed every son that was born by the Gods. In a row, every newborn son dies at Kangsa's hands. By the time Godki bears his seventh son, the fate of his unborn child will not be the same as that of his previous six. The fetus she miraculously conceived was transferred to a Rohini who was wanting a son. Therefore, Baladives are called Sankarsana, which means \"to transfer the fetus.\" Finally, Rohini welcomed the Baladives as her son. In his childhood, he was named Rama. But because of its amazing power, it is called Balarama (strong ramama) or Baladive. Baladives spent their childhood as cattleherders with Kresna and her friends.

In ancient history it was a means of conveying religious teachings. While religion is hard to define, a standard model of religion, used in religious studies, was submitted by Clifford Geertz, who simply referred to it as a \"cultural system.\" A criticism for the Geertz model by Talal Asad categorizes religion as \"an anthropological category.\" Many religions have mythology, symbols, and sacred history that are meant to explain the meaning, purpose of life and origin of life or the universe. From their beliefs about the cosmos and human nature, people acquire morality, ethics, customary laws, or a preferred lifestyle. According to some estimates, there are some 4,200 religions in the world. Many religions may have organized behavior, priesthood, defined what is obedience or membership, sacred places, and scriptures. Religious practice can also include rituals, sermons, warnings or worships of gods, gods or goddesses, sacrifices, festivals, parties, transs, initiations, marriages, meditations, prayers, music, dances, or other aspects of human culture. Religion may also contain mythology. The word religion is sometimes used alternating with faith, belief system, or sometimes arranging tasks. However, according to sociologist \u00c9mile Durkheim, religion is different from personal belief because it is \"something real social.\" \u00c9mile Durkheim also says that religion is a united system of beliefs and practices associated with sacred things.

According to the Turrbal tradition, what is now the city of Brisbane was once called Meanjin or Mianjin by the inhabitants of Turrbal. Meanwhile, Brisbane's own name as a city territory was obtained because of his position in the downstream region of Brisbane River, which earned its name from the governor of the state of New South Wales at the time of the city's establishment, Governor Sir Thomas Makdougall Brisbane. Brisbane owns an international airport, Brisbane International Airport, which is the third busiest airport in Australia. Within the city, the public transportation available is buses and trains connected with large railway networks in the southeast of Queensland. In addition, Brisbane also hosted various international events such as the 1982 Commonwealth Games, World Expo 1988, the G20 Brisbane High Level Conference 2014.

In 1879, Heinrich Anton de Bary defined it as \"a different organism that lives together.\" This term has been the subject of debate for more than a century about whether symbiosis should specifically point to the mutualism, as in liken; biologists have now abandoned those limits. Symbiosis can be an obligatory thing, which means one or two symbions depend entirely on each other to survive, or facultative (optional) when they can generally live on their own. Symbiosis is also classified on the basis of physical attachment; the symbiosis of organisms that have a body/organal union is called conjunctive symbiosis, and the symbiosis in which they are not united is called disjungtive symbiotic symbiosis. When one organism lives in another organism, it's called endosymbiosis. In 1877, Albert Bernhard Frank used symbiotic terms previously used to describe people who lived together in society to describe the mutual relationship in liken. In 1879, German mycologist Heinrich Anton de Bary defined it as \"a different organism that lives together.\" These definitions vary among scientists with some encouragement that symbiosis refers only to persistent mutualism, while others think that symbiosis should be applied to all kinds of persistent biological interactions, in other words including mutualistic, comensalism, or parasite.",

Symbiotic relationships can become obligates, which means that one or two symbions depend entirely on each other for survival. For example, on liken, which consists of fungal symbion and symbiones that can photosynthesis, his mushroom partner cannot live on his own. Symbion algae or phenobacterials in moss, such as Trentepohlia, can generally live on their own, therefore the symbiosis is a facultative (optional).

Mutations at the gene level are called dot mutations, whereas mutations in chromosomes are usually called aberrations. The mutation in genes can lead to the emergence of new alleles and to the basis of new variations in species. Mutations occur at low frequencies in nature, usually lower than 1:10,000 individuals. Natural mutations can be attributed to mutation plants (mutagens, including carcinogens), solar radiation, radioactive radiation, ultraviolet light, X - rays, and lightning surges like lightning. Individuals who display the change in character (fenotipe) resulting from mutations are called mutants. In genetic studies, mutants are common compared to individuals who don't experience changes in character (wild type or \"wild type\"). Mutation point is a change in N base from DNA or RNA. Relative point mutations often occur but the effect can be reduced by gene recovery mechanisms. Point mutations can result in a change in the amino acid sequence of proteins, and can result in a decrease, change or loss of enzyme function. The current technology uses dot mutations as a marker (called SNP) to review the changes that occur in genes and are associated with the changes in phenotypes that occur. The sample of gene mutations is a nitritic acid reaction with adenine into a hypoxanthine substance. This substance will occupy the original adenine place and pair it with cytosine, not with thymine. The mutation of chromosomes, often referred to as large mutations or chromosomes, is the change in the number of chromosomes and the sequence or sequence of genes in chromosomes. The mutation of chromosomes is often due to meiosis errors and a little bit in mitosis. Euploidi is the change in number n. In this case, \"n\" signifies the number of chromosomal sets. For example, the human cell has 2 chromosomes so it's called 2n, where a human n package is 23 chromosomes.",

Aneusomi is a change in the number of chromosomes. The cause is anaphase lag and non disjunction. Aneusomi in humans can cause: it happens when a chromosome fragment is broken and lost during cell division. The chromosomes where the fragments come from will then lose certain genes. But in some cases, those fragment fractures can bond with homologous chromosomes produce duplicates. It can also attach itself back to its original chromosome in reverse direction and produce inversion. The ingredients that cause mutations are called mutagens. Mutagen is divided into three meanings: In general, mutations are harmful, the mutants are letting and the homozygote are recessive. But mutations are also profitable, among them, through mutations, to create superior polyploid plants. For example, watermelons without seeds, oranges without seeds, large strawberries, etcetera. This mutation is also one of the key to evolution in this world. The formation of polyploid plants benefits humans, but it harms vegetation that are mutated, since it becomes geneatively unproducing. Although biologically most of the mutations cause disturbances in individual fitness, even death, mutation is actually one of the key to the adaptability of a type (species) to a new or changing environment. This positive side is used by a number of applied biological fields.

In a sense, the limit of this ability is a useful test because it recognizes the \"general\" computer from an earlier special means tool.

Generally, plasmid encodes genes that are necessary in order to survive less profitable circumstances so that if the environment returns to normal, the plasmid DNA can be discarded. The discovery of plasmid has begun since 1887, when Robert Koch published his research on Bacllus anthrax bacteria as the cause of anthrax disease. Some 100 years later, scientists discovered that the bacteria had two plasmids that were a virulence factor in anthrax. The term plasmid was introduced in 1952 by American biologist Joshua Ledenberg referring to \"hereditary offspring outside the chromosomes.\" Joshua Lederberg and W. Hayes were able to investigate the conjugal events of Escherichia coli involving plasmid. The initial use of the term \"plasmid\" includes any genetic material that exists extraroosomally at least for some of the replication cycles, including the genetic material of the virus. But plasmid ideas are perfected from time to time to consist of genetic elements that reproduce autonomously. Then in 1968, it was decided that that definition was narrowed down to an exclusive or dominant genetic element outside of the chromosome and could be replicated independently. Not long after that, plasmids proved to be extrachromosomal DNA that causes antibiotic resistance to the type of enteric bacteria and can be transmitted between cells.

Plasmids are found in the form of double strands that are mostly arranged into supercoils or twisted coils. The supercoil structure occurs because the topoisomerase enzyme allows some DNA to double off (unbound) as long as plasmid replication takes place. The supercoil structure will cause plasmid DNA to be in a conformation called a covalent or covalently closed circular (ccc), but if both strands of DNA are released then it will return in normal (uninformed) and that conformation is called an open circuler (oc). In order for plasmids to replicate independently in cells, they must have a DNA sequence that can act as a replication orgin (ori). Self replication units, in this case plasmid, are called replicions.

Similarly, after the Berber dynasty, Almohades conquered C\u00f3rdoba in 1148, they did not eliminate Dzimmah (Protective property & life of non-Muslims) in some parts of the sultanial territory. This Dzimmah was a protection of both Jewish and Christian communities. No historical record of deplorable treatment of Jews and Christians after the period of 1148 had a poor interpretation. Even many Jews and Muslims were forced to convert after the Islamic Empire ended up in Cordoba by King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella and expelled Christians, but because the authorities suspected that someone was pretending to change religion, then the new convert was required to wear special clothes that distinguished them and could be supervised in public places.

The date and month of Julian's Calendar was perfected in 1582 into the Gregorian calendar. This dating is then used widely in the world to facilitate communication. The Common Era (short of C.E.) and before C.E. (short of B.C.) comes from Arabic, meaning \"wash,\" \"snack\" or \"kill.\" (See also Al-still). This word in Arabic Bible is used for the Hebrew term \"Messiah\" or \"Messiah\" meaning \"God\" or \"Lord\" in Abrahamic religion in Latin this date is called \"Anno Domini\" (abbreviated AD for\" Year of God\") which is used widely in the world.

Dionysius never said how he determined the date of Jesus ' birth, but he may have used the surviving writings of early Christians like Clement of Alexandria or Eusebius of Caesarea to help estimate the date, according to Alden Mosshammer, a professor of history at the University of California in San Diego in his book \"The Easter Commission and the Origins of the Christian Era.\" Dionysius attempted to establish 1 C.E. as the year of Jesus Christ's birth, but his estimate missed several years by a modern estimate that placed Christ's birth about 4 B.C.E. Dionysius designed his system to replace the Diocletian system, named after Diocletian, a Roman Emperor from 284 C.E. to 305 C.E., using the number of years since Diocletian as emperor of Rome. First year at Dionysius Easter, \"Ano Domini 532,\" followed the year \"Ano Diocletani 247,\" according to Project Muse University of Johns Hopkins. Dionysius made a special change to omit the memory of Diocletian, who had cruelly persecuted Christians. Diocletian published an emic that resulted in the killing or imprisonment of many Christians and the burning of churches and Bibles. The addition of the \"Before the Common Era\" component occurred two centuries after Dionysius, when His Majesty Bede of Northumbria published \"The Church of English History\" in 731.

One Farad is defined as a capacitance of a capacitor passed by electricity with a coulomb charge, so there is a difference in the electrical potential of one volt. On the contrary, it's a capacitance that when it's electrified with a potential difference of one volt, it's loaded with a coulomb. One coulomb is equal to the amount of cargo produced by a single ampere (A) current that flows for one second. For example, the potential difference between two terminals a 2 F capacitor will increase linearly every 1 V when a 2 A current flows through it for 1 second. In most applications, the Farad is a large, inoperative capacitation unit. Most electronic applications use the following SI prefix: One farad has a representation of the following IC:s4 \u00d7 A2 \u00d72 \u00d72 kg1.1 More can be stated as: where A=ampere, V=volt, C=coulomb, J=joule, m=meter, N=newton, s=second (second), W=wattogram, kilogram=kilogram, H=hm, H=henry.

A value of 0.1 pF is the smallest value available in capacitor for common use in eletronic design, because the smaller one will be dominated by other parasitic capacitation components, wire or printed circuit boards.

The benefits of an asset include keeping the value of an asset where the company can keep its asset value high, having a longer life, and avoiding damage to the asset can lower its value, setting right asset investments where the company keeps its asset rich is to keep its assets up, monitoring asset reduction where the company can monitor the risk of using the assets, increasing the security of assets in which companies can minimize loss of assets or damaged assets and create risk management where the company grows corporate awareness at risk and risk of assets. Generally having an asset's goal is to maintain the health of companies that are economic sources in the future. For example, bank companies are able to anticipate the interconnected external changes to support operations that are going on against the risk of interest rates or changing currency exchange rates. Specifically, the asset objectives of a banking company are described as bank policy guidelines that are going to date, accommodations of needs that have been planned to increase funds, cash, productive activation and office facilities in fund allocation and positioning the bank that can adopt the increase of profit whether for future conditions can increase. The asset itself has a major characteristic of other components as distinguishing the benefits of the Future Economics (Fature Economic Benefits) meaning that assets have economic benefits that can one day be obtained. It is also defined that assets have the capacity to provide services or benefits to companies that use them are obtained one day in the next.

The cytoplasm in liquid state is called plasmasol and when it's solid or gel called plasmagel. A second exchange of circumstances, which is from plasma to plasmagel known as Sol-Gel theory, is responsible for Amoeba's movements. Amoeba can push itself only when the cytoplasm is liquid. When Amoeba's body cooled, ectoplasm was formed. Soon the plasma is flowing through the center of the cell to the leading parts of the body that have advanced. Amoeba's movement occurs when plasmasol flows. Plasma will then be converted into plasmagel due to the loss of water. The movement then stops at this stage because the cytoplasm turns solid. When ameba needs to push its body one more time, plasma is converted into plasmasol by absorbing water from its surroundings.

Maxwell stated that light is like a wave that is essentially an electromagnetic phenomenon. Thus, he argued that light was a form of electromagnetic radiation. Heinrich Rudolf Hertz was a German physicist who clarified and expanded the electromagnetic theory of light that Maxwell had proposed. He was the first to show an electromagnetic wave by building a device to generate and detect VHF and UHF waves. Hertz developed a VHF and UHF wave antenna. UHF and VHF are the most commonly used frequency ribbons for television signal transmissions. In addition to television broadcasts, UHF ribbons can also be used for other things, which is: sending and receiving TV and radio signals are influenced by many variables.

UHF signals don't have the ability to harness what is carried along the ionosphere but UHF signals can be reflected from low-charged particles to another point on earth to reach a further distance. The main advantage of UHF's ribbon is that short physical waves are capable of being generated by high frequencies. The size of the antenna transmission and reception, depending on the size of the radio wave. UHF antennaes are a little fat and short. Installing smaller antennas is already capable of being used for higher frequencies. The main loss of UHF is the limited range of broadcasts and receipts, often referred to as line-of- sight between the antenna transmission of TV stations and customer reception antennas. The difference between UHF antennas and VHF basically lies in its size. UHF frequencies are much higher than VHF, so antennas are used smaller. The difference in transmission VHF and UHF are only on the frequency area they're coming from. The magnitude of the emitting power will affect the magnitude of a television broadcast signal at a certain place at a certain distance from a television station. The higher the spark power the greater the stronger the acceptance field of television broadcasts. But the enormous acceptance of television broadcasts is not only influenced by the magnitude of dispersal power. The amount of dispersal power required to reach a target at a certain distance is affected by the size of the frequency, the antenna height of the transmitter and the receiver antenna, the profile between the location of the transmitter and the location of the receiver, and the size of the high level of terrain expected to be accepted by the receiver.",

Lewis considers this theory as a generalized definition of Br\u00f8nsted so acid is a chemical species that accepts electron pairs both directly and through the release of protons (H+) into solution, which then accepts electron pairs. However, hydrogen chloride, acetic acid, and most of the other Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry acids cannot form covalent bonds with an electron pair so it's not Lewis acid. On the contrary, much of Lewisic acid does not include either Arrhenius and Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry acid. In modern terminology, acid is implicitly referred to Br\u00f8nsted acid instead of Lewis acid, since chemists almost always refer to Lewis acid explicitly as Lewisic acid.

In the story, she was the daughter of King Drudada and Persati of the Kingdom of Panchala. In the book of Mahabharata of Adiparwa and Udyogaparwa, it is explained that he was the reincarnation of the daughter of the kingdom of Kasi named Amba, who died with a grudge against Bisma, the prince of the Kuru Dynasty. Then Amba was reborn as Drudada's daughter. But because of the demigods, he was raised as a man. Another version tells us that he exchanged sex with yaksa (an occult creature). In a version of Java's adaptation the Mahabharata contains almost the same story. But in Java's history, it was told that he married Arjuna, and this was a very distant distinction compared to the Indian version of the Mahabharata. Srikandi's name is an Indonesian version of the Sanskrit version of \u25aaickha normally. Its feminine form is \u25aaickha-in-sacrifice. Literally, the word \u25aaikhandin or \u25aaikhandini means \"have the fringe-baid\" or \"who has the crest.\" In the Mahabharata, in a previous life Srikandi was born as a woman named Amba. The story of Amba is contained in the first Mahabharata, Adiparwa, and in the fifth volume of Mahabharata, Udyogaparwa. In Adiparwa it is said that Bisma menderan of Hastinapura, the capital of the Kingdom of Kuru membolong Amba of a sayembara in the Kingdom of Kasi, to marry Wicitrawirya, his half brother. Upon his arrival at Hastinapura, Amba admitted that she had chosen King Salwa as her future husband. Since Bisma did not want Amba to get married under compulsion, she returned Amba to marry King Salwa. But Salwa King who felt that his pride was trampled on by Bisma didn't want to marry Amba. Amba returned to Bisma's home to be married, but Bisma refused her for taking an oath of celibacy.",

But Parasaturama was unable to force Bisma to marry Amba, even though it was a violent path. At last Amba decided to pray to the gods to find a way to kill Bisma. According to the Mahabharata rewritten C. Rajagopalachari, the Lord Subramama gave her puspamala and said that the person who would wear it would become a Bisma killer. Even Amba sought out those who were willing to wear it, but no one had the courage to guarantee the success of the god. After being rejected by various knights, Amba finally arrived at King Drudada's palace, and received the same results. Desperately, Amba threw the puspamala above the palace gates and no one dared to touch it. From Drudada's palace, Amba went and prayed to Lord Shiva with the desire to be the cause of Bisma's death. Amba's request was granted by the gods. However, as a woman who had never received military training, Amba asked Shiva about how to kill Bisma. Lord Shiva answered that the murders did not occur in Amba's life at that time, but in Amba's next life. The god said that Amba would reincarnate into the man who caused Bisma's death. Upon hearing the answer of the god, Amba confidently took his own life. Amba was born Srikandi, the son of King Drudadi. In the Mahabharata, Srikandi is a very androgite figure. The story of gender determination takes place in various versions. In a related version, when Srikandi was young, she found a puspamala hanging above the gates of her palace.",

In addition, the library also provides a public facility for access to CD-ROM data warehouses and the Internet. The library can also be interpreted as a collection of knowledgeable information, entertainment, recreation, and worship that are human rights. Therefore the modern library has been redefined as a place to access information in any format, whether it is stored in the library building or not. In this modern library besides a collection of printed books, part of the book and its collection are in a digital library (in the form of data accessible through a computer network). The first known library was in the ruins of the Plains of Nineveh. Its location was in an ancient Assyrian city situated on the east bank of the Tigris River.

The cabbage head generally ranges from 5 to 4 kilograms (10 to 9 pounds), and it can be green, purple and white. Hard - headed green cabbages are the most common, with fine - leafed red cabbages and the sappoy leafy cabbages of both colors look more rare. Kubis are multilayered vegetables. In the long sunlit day conditions such as those found at the northern latitude in summer, cabbages can grow much larger. Some records are discussed at the end of history. It's hard to track the exact history of cabbages, but it's most likely domesticated somewhere in Europe before 1000 BC, although the savoys were not developed until the 16th century. By the Middle Ages, cabbage had become an important part of European cuisine. The cabbage head is generally taken during the first year of the plant's living cycle, but plants intended for seed are allowed to grow in the second year, and they must continue to be separated from other Cole plants to prevent cross pollination. Kubis are vulnerable to some malnutrition, as well as some pests, and bacterial and fungi diseases.

This original species evolved over thousands of years into what it's seen today, because selection causes the cultivar to have different characteristics, such as the big head for the cabbage, the big leaves for the kale and the thick stems with the flower buds of broccoli. The epithets of capitata are derived from the Latin word for \"have a head.\" B. oleracea and its derivative have hundreds of common names all over the world. \"Cabbine\" was originally used to refer to various forms of B. oleracea, including the loose-headed or no-head.

Crisis is thought to bring negative changes in security, social, or environmental matters, crisis tetikas occur suddenly, with little or no warning. Furthermore, a crisis is a term that means \"test time\" or \"emergency event.\" Crisis is often associated with the concept of psychological pressure. In Western culture, this term is often used to give scary or uncertain experiences. While in oriental cultures like China, crisis can mean danger and opportunity.

In general, crisis is a complex system situation (well the family system, the economy, society) which when it functions badly, decisions are quickly taken, but the cause is not immediately identified.

Therefore the requirement for being 'unforeseen' depends on man's failure to record the beginning of crisis conditions.

In addition to electromagnetic radiation, and perhaps gravitational radiation, which can travel through a vacuum, waves are also present in mediums (which because shape changes can produce spring forces) where they can travel and can move energy from one place to another without causing the medium particles to move permanently; that is, there's no mass displacement. In general, the waves are divided into wave groups based on vines and wave groups based on medium vines. Based on the direction of the vines, waves can be grouped into longitudial waves and transversal waves. Whereas according to the bridge medium, waves are grouped into mechanical waves and electromagnetic waves. A medium is called: the longitudnal wave is a wave that has the same vibration direction as the bow. Longitunal waves can be observed on spring vibrations. Transversal waves are waves with vertical vibrations in the direction of the rambat. The intersection is the shifting distance of the point in the medium. The measure of distance starts from the balance position. The intersection of a medium point is always changing from minimum value to maximum value during waves. Maximum and minimum values are reached periodically. Amplitude is a maximum crossing point that waves pass in medium. The fixed value of the intersection is an amplitude value. Maximum concise values can be both positive and negative. It is difficult to make a definition of all that includes aspects of the word wave. A vibration can be defined as a \"turnback\" movement.

In waves, the energy from a vibration moves away from its source in the form of a disturbance around its medium (Hall 1980, pp. 8). However, it's a problem for a transversal wave (for example, a wave on a rope), where energy moves in both directions, or for electromagnetic/light waves in a vacuum, where medium concepts don't apply and interaction with a target is the primary key to detecting and practical application of a wave. Among other water waves on sea level; light waves are generated by the Sun; microwaves are used in microwave ovens; radio waves broadcast by radio stations; and sound waves are generated by radio wave receivers, cell phones and living creatures (as sound), to mention only a few wave phenomena. Perhaps it's apparent that the description of the wave is closely related to its physical origin for every specific sample of the process of forming the wave. For example, acoustics are distinguished from optics in sound waves related to mechanics rather than to the transfer of electromagnetic waves caused by vibrations. Concepts like mass, momentum, inertia, or elasticity, therefore it's important to describe the acoustics (as different from the optics) for the process of wave formation. The difference in initial recognition of certain wave characteristics against the nature of the medium involved.

He served as chairman of the People's Council from 1997 to 1999, and was a factor in the retreat of President Soeharto during the widespread student demonstration that took place at the end of the New Order. Born of a simple family in East Java, on February 7, 1939, Harmoko graduated from journalistic school, and became a journalist. He was active during the led democracy regime and the New Order, working in a number of different newspapers, including Merdeka, Merdiko, and Our Mimbar Daily. In 1970 he founded his own newspaper, the city post. In 1970, he was elected General Chairman of the United Indonesian Journalists (PWI) branch of Jakarta, and two years later, he was elected General Chairman of the Central PWI. In the 1977 elections, Harmoko was selected as a member of the People's Council of Representatives, as a member of the ruling work group (Golkar). In 1983 he was appointed Minister of Attack, likely because of his background in journalism. His skill in maintaining the image of the new Order and Suharto's appearance has earned him the nickname 'influencer-in-chief'. In 1993, Harmoko was elected Head of Golkar, the first civilian to hold that position. In June 1997, he was appointed minister of state for special business, which he served for only three months because in October 1997, he was elected viceroy of the People's Association and the House of Representatives. Despite years of loyalty to President Soeharto, after a widespread student demonstration called for a government change, Harmoko made a big surprise at the press conference by asking the president to stand down within five days. Probably because of the fact that he might be upset with his firing as an illumination minister, his firing as the vice president, and his home were burned by protesters.",

The word optics is derived from the Latin optical fields typically represent visible light properties, infrared and ultraviolet; but because light is an electromagnetic wave, the same symptoms occur in X-rays, microwaves, radio waves, and other forms of electromagnetic radiation as well as similar symptoms in the beam of charge particles. Optics can generally be considered part of magnetism. Some optic symptoms depend on the quantum properties of light associated with some fields of optics to quantum mechanics. In practice, most of the optical symptoms can be calculated by using electromagnetic properties of light, as Maxwell's equation explains. The optical field has its own identities, communities, and conferences. His scientific aspect is often called optical science or optical physics. Applied optical science is often called optical engineering. The application of optical engineering associated specifically with the illumination system is called lighting engineering. Each discipline tends to be slightly different in its applications, technical skills, focus, and professional affiliates. Newer innovations in optical engineering are often categorized as photonics or optoelectronics. The boundaries between this field and \"optik\" are often unclear, and terms are used differently in different parts of the world and in different areas of industry. Because of the extensive application of light science for real world applications, optical science and optical engineering tend to be very cross-disciplined. optical science is part of a wide range of disciplines related to electro, physics, psychology, medicine (especially optamology and optometry), and so on.

When entering a specific medium (dielectric or nonconducting) the wave runs at a v speed, which is characteristic of materials and less than the speed of light itself (c). The ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum with the speed of light in the medium is the index of bias n material as follows: n = c\u2044v Before quantum optics become important, it consists of classic electromagnetic apps and high frequency approaches to light. Classic optics are divided into two main branches: geometric optics and physis optics. The geometric optics, or ray optics, explain the propagation of light in the form \"sinar.\" The beam is turned on the interface between two different mediums, and it can be curved in a medium where the index-refraction is a function of position. \"Sinar\" in geometrical optics is an abstract object, or \"instruction,\" which parallels the wave face of the actual optical wave. The geometric optics provide rules for the spread of this beam through the optical system, which shows how the real wave face will spread. It's a significant simplification of optics, and it fails to account for many of the important optical effects such as diffraction and polarization. But it's a good approach, if the wavelength of light is very small compared to the size of the structure interacting with it. The geometric optics can be used to explain the geometric aspects of the image of light (imaging), including optical aberration.

Jupiter is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium. A quarter of Jupiter's mass is helium, although it is only a tenth of Jupiter's composition. The planet may have rocky nuclei made up of heavy elements, but it does not have solid surfaces like other gas giants. As a result of its rapid rotation, the planet is spherical. The outer atmosphere is divided into several layers of different latitudes, and the interaction between those layers generates storms.

The maximum wave length of anilin is 230 nm. This is because of a pair of alone electrons on NH2 that interact with electron rings to increase the density of electrons in the entire ring, especially at orto positions and the people from rings. Anilin is a chemical that can be made out of several different ways and materials, and it can be used to make various chemical products. In today's industrialized era, anilins play an important role and are widely used as synthetic dyes and rubbers in the industrial world. Anilin was first isolated from the destructive indigo distillation in 1826 by Otto Unverdorben, who named it the crystal. In 1834, Friedrich Runge (Pogg. Ann;., 1834, 31, thing 65 32, thing 331) isolated from the coal tar of the substance producing a beautiful blue color on the treatment of the lime chloride, which is called kyanol or cynol in 1841, CJ Fritzsche showed that, by treating the indigo with fire pots, it produced oil, which he named anilina, from one specific name of one of these plants, from the Portuguese anil \"ingo\" bush\" from an Arabic \"nila assimilation of al-hil, from the Persian nila, from the \"ingo\" with anal anal, which he named anal, from the old Sans, nila, nila. About the same time NN Zinin discovered that, to reduce nitrobenzene, the base was formed, which he named benzidam. August Wilhelm von Hofmann investigated the substance in various ways, and proved to be identical (1855), and since then they have taken their place as one body, by name or Fenilamin anilin.",

Its scale industry used first in the making of the mauveine, a purple dye discovered in 1856 by Hofmann student William Henry Perkin. At the time of the mauveine discovery, anilin was an expensive laboratory compound, but it was immediately prepared \"by tons\" using a process previously discovered by Antoine B\u00e9champ. The synthetic dye industry thrived as a new anilin-based dye was discovered in the 1850s and 1860s. Anilin production can be performed through various processes among other things: In chlorobenzen amination process using liquid ammonia activity, in liquid phasasia with a heated Oxide Copper Catalyst will produce 85 - 90 %ilin. Whereas the Catalyst active for this reaction is the Chlorid Copper formed from an ammonium chloride side reaction with Oxide Copper. First liquid ammonia is inserted into the mixer and at the same time chlorobenzen is inserted, the pressure in the mixer is 200 atm. From a mixed mix of chlorobenzen with ammonia is passed into the preheater and then into the reactor with a temperature reaction of 235 \u00b0C and 200 atm pressure. On this reaction the liquid ammonia used was excessive. Using certain catalysts, the reaction is as follows :C6H5Cl + 2 NH3 ===> C6HN2+ NH4ClDate chlorobenzen nomination process, the result obtained is 96 (Greggins, 1958 ). A.

In modern times, the meaning of this word has turned into \"an institution of higher education that offers teaching in nonvocacy fields and usually has the power to give titles.\" An important concept that distinguishes universities from others is the concept of academic freedom.

Some consider the University of Al Quaraoiyine founded in Morocco by Fatima al Fihri in 859 to be the oldest title - giver university in the world. There are some similarities between the early universities that were founded in areas around the Mediterranean Sea with the madrassa in Islam. The difference is, the madrassa is usually smaller and the one who gives the title is usually the teachers in the madrassa itself and not the madrassa. Historians like Arnold H. Green and Hossein Nasr argued that in the early 10th century, there were several Islamic madrassas that turned into universities. However, other historians like George Makdition, Toby Huff and Norman Daniel argue that European - style universities have nothing in common with anything in the Middle Ages Islamic world. There are other scientists who argue that university concepts are native to Europe, both in history, and in characteristics. Darleen Pryds asked this question and showed that the various madrassa and European universities in the Mediterranean area have similar characteristics, both of which get funding from the nobles and are created to supply local bureaucrats loyal to the government agenda.",

True to age 40, the angel of Gabriel approached Muhammad and received the first revelation from God. Three years after the first revelation, Muhammad declared his submission to God. Muhammad received revelation gradually until his death. Muhammad's practice of doing good deeds is done in the past, referred to by the believers as a source of Islam along with the Quran.

Nevertheless, in the past they were not considered to be associated with the Celts by outsiders. The term \"Kelt\" comes from the ancient Greeks.

However, the literature of European history before the 19th century never mentions \"Kelt\" or \"Keltic\" at all. Today's mention comes from archaeological discoveries that point to the migration of Celts from Gaul and Belgium to the British Islands, such as Atrebates, Fired, and Parisi, and played a role in the formation of the Celts. The obvious Celtic description is that they speak or are descended from the speakers of one of the Keltic languages. Wales, the island of Ireland, Scotland, Cornwall, the island of Man and Bretagne is referred to as \"the land of Keltik\" because people speak languages that belong to Keltic. Another European region associated with Keltic is Galicia in Spain, and Devon, Cumbria and Northumbria in England.

Its byproducts are also used for human purposes. In a number of places, cows are also used as transporters, farm processing, and other industrial tools (such as cane gold). Because of these many uses, the cow has been part of various human cultures for a long time. Most cows are descendants of a wild breed known as aurochs (in German meaning \"an ancient cow\", scientific name: the primigenius boss], which has been extinct in Europe since 1627. However, there are several other species of wild cows whose offspring are domesticated, including those that are also raised in Indonesia. At first, cows were identified as three separate species: extinct boss tarus (European cow), boss indicus (zebu), and aurochs' boss (aurochs). As time went on, scientists experienced disagreements. They consider the current domestic cow to be subspecies in the same species. Some scientists then argue that aurochs and domestic cows are still of one species. The taxonomy Information System (ITIS) classifies cows in a species of tarus boss of three subspecies: Primiggenius tarus boss, tarus tarus, and boss tarus indicus. There are various terms used worldwide to classify cows. Some of those terms, especially those related to the cattle farm industry, come from English. Cows are four-legged mammals with split paths. Most cows have horns. Nevertheless, genetic selection has made the cow scattered everywhere. As a ruminansian animal, cows eat and digest plants through fermentation in their digestive system.",

The rumen is the largest room, the reticulum or the mesh is the smallest chamber, the omasum is where it absorbs the water and the nutrients of the digested feed, while the abomum acts like a human hull and is referred to as the \"true hull\" of the cow. When a cow eats, food is swallowed directly from the mouth without being chewed properly and stored in a rumen until the animal finds a quiet place to continue the digestive process. The fermented feed in the rumen is then regurgitated (returned to mouth) to be chewed again by the germinated teeth to be a tiny particle called mamahan. This process of re-inflicting is called rumination. Mamahan was then reabsorbed and further digested by special microorganisms in the rumen, which were primarily responsible for disassociating cellulose and other carbohydrates into volatile fatty acids that cows used as their primary metabolism fuel. Microbs inside the rumen also synthesize amino acids from nonprotein nitrogen sources, such as urea and ammonia. When these microbes multiply in the rumen, older generations die and their cells are carried through the digestive tract and digested partially in the small intestines. This enables cows to acquire high - quality sources of protein. In addition to mating naturally, in cows are also artificial inseminations (IB) for animal breeding. The IB technique was performed by placing cement from bulls into the womb of cows during the estrus. The breeding period on cows lasted about nine months. Sometimes, there's trouble in childbirth called dystocia. In some parts of Indonesia, newborn calves are called pedets. Naturally, pedets will breastfeed for 7 to 8 months before weaning.",

Methanogens are usually coccoid, basil, and there are some species that are spirilum. There are over 50 species that can be categorized in groups of methane that don't form monofiletic groups, even though all methane is in an archeological group. Metanogen has some special properties that distinguish some other procaritates, namely: Some types of methane, referred to as hydrogenotrophic, using carbon dioxide (CO2) as a source of carbon and hydrogen. Some CO2 is associated with hydrogen to produce methane that can produce electrochemical gradients across the membrane, used to produce ATP (adenosine triphosphate) by means of the kemiosmosis. Metanogen plays an important ecological role in anaerobic environment, which is to play a role in eliminating the excess hydrogen and fermentation products produced from an anaerobic respiration. Metanogen grows and develops when in a molecular environment that acts as an electron acceptor other than exhausted CO2, for example oxygen, nitrate, iron, and sulfate.

Methane oxidizing microbas are closely associated with methane as a substrate associated with sulfate reduction and nitrate. The majority of Metanogens are classified into autotrophic microbes but that oxidizes CH3COO- are classified into chemotrophys. Proteomic comparison analysis has led to identification of 31 specific and specific proteins owned by Metanogen. Most of these proteins relate to metanegenesis and can serve as molecular markers for Metanogenes. Then, 10 proteins found in all methane are owned by the Arcaheglobus so that it shows that both groups have kinship. In the filogentic tree, Metanogen is not monofiletic and is generally divided into 3 clauses. That shows a unique protein that is owned by the majority of Metanogen, because of lateral gene transfers. In addition, proteins related to sulfide trafficking yabg have been linked to Archaea Metanogen. Deeper protonomic analysis is required in order to reveal a new path to metabolic methane and to distinguish specifically the generas in Metanogen class. By means of a sequencing approach of DNA or RNA has explained some special genome markers for several groups of methane. One of the findings isolated nine methanegens from the genus Methanoculleus and discovered that there are at least two syntase trehalas genes found in the nine genomes.

Micrometers are also used in telescopes and microscopes that each one uses to measure the diameter of a celestial body and the diameter of a microscopic object. Micrometers used by telescopes were discovered about 1638 by William Gascoigne, a British astronomer. Microscopic-observable biological objects are micro-size/dimensional. For measurement (long, wide, diameter) a microscopic object is used micrometer ocular. The flat-shaped ocular micrometer, in the middle, has a scale that resembles a 0, 10, 20, 100 ruler. The ocular micrometer is used in a way that is installed in the ocular lens. The scale in the micrometer of the ocular is determined by the length of the unit using an objective micrometer.

The message from the Bible text that was at the heart of the talk. The message was preached in Greek called Kerygma. Kerygma is a message from a Bible text that was previously interpreted. The way in which talks are communicated is also different from how others communicate. The Sermon on the Mount is one example of a talk performed by Jesus. The Sermon on the Hill is also one of the references to the ethics of the New Testament. Jesus in his preaching was about the coming Kingdom of God. The talk included Jesus ' calling or calling to each person to repentance. Besides Jesus, the man who was famous for his talk in the New Testament was Paul. Paul's favorite message is centered on Christ's death and resurrection according to the Bible. In sermons there are certain ways in the science of preaching. The study of the Sermon is also known as homylethica. Homillietha is a tool that a preacher must overcome. In the building of the talks, the process of hermeneutics is also needed. This process of Hermeneutic helps the preacher interpret the text so that it's contextual. The talk in Christianity first emerged from Jewish practice. The practice then developed within the Christian liturgy. The talk in the New Testament church was biblical, a speech of community development and an expansion of missionary development. The talk was intended to convey messages in the Bible, such as the essence of life, death, resurrection, and the hope of the coming of Jesus Christ.",

From an etymology angle, the word Cnidaria comes from the Greek \"cnidos\" meaning \"spit jar.\" It's cnidaria's stinging ability that's the origin of their names. The signature of Cnidaria is knidocyte, which is the specialized cell they use primarily to catch prey and defend themselves. Their body consists of mesoglea, a jellylike lifeless substance, located between two layers of epitelium that are usually as thick as one cell. They have two basic forms of body: a self-swimming medusia and a cesspool of polyps, both radial symmetrical with their mouths surrounded by symmetrical tentacles. Both forms have digestive and respiratory cavity, and a hole that serves as both a mouth and anus. Many cnidaria produce colonies that are single organisms made up of zoid. For a long time, Cnidaria was grouped with Ctenophora in the Coelenterata filum, but after their differences began to be realized, they were placed on separate filums. Cnidaria is classified as four main groups: Sensational Anthozoa consists of sea anemones, corals, and sea pens, Scyphozoa, Cubozoa (box jellyfish) and hydrozoa, a body of multiorganism made up of all the cnifada and some species of seawater. Other groups of animals are also considered separate classes such as Staurozoa and Myxozoa and Polypodioa (both parasites). Cnidaria forms animal filums that are more complex than sponges, almost a complex ctenophora, and less complex than any other animal, which consists of almost any other animal.

Like sponges and ctenophora, cnidaria has two major cell layers that flank the central layer of jelly called mesoglea in cnidara; more complex animals have three major cell layers and no jagged layer of jelly. Hence, cnidaria and ctenophora are referred to as diploblastic along with sponges. Adult Cnidaria has two basic forms: Medusa that can swim freely (motil) and Polip that adhere to substrates (sessil). Both forms have radial symmetry. The animal has no head and its mouth and anus lies in the same hole, the side near its mouth is called a oral and is called an aboral instead. Cnidaria has tentacles full of knidocytes on its side. Some hydrozoa are made up of zooid colonies that have various functions, such as defenses and hunting prey. Mesoglea polyps are usually thin and soft, while medusa has a thick, elastic mesoglea, which allows medusa to glide in the water and form itself again. On the medusa, the only support of the body is mesoglea. Polyps like Hydra and most marine anemones cover their mouths when they are not eating, and the water in their body cavity acts as a hydrostatic skeleton, similar to a balloon filled with water. Other polyps such as Tubularia use a pile of water - filled cells as supports. Coral secretes the outer skeleton (exoskeleton) of calcium carbonate.

The need for water in hydroponics is less than the need for water in cultivating with soil. Hydroponics use more efficient water, so it fits into areas with limited water supply. Hydroponics comes from the Greek word hydro which means water and pontos meaning power. Hydroponics are also known as soilless culture or cultured crops without soil. So hydroponics means cultivating plants that harness water and without using soil as a plant media or soilless. In language studies, hydroponics come from a hydro word meaning water and ponos which means work. So hydroponics have a free understanding of the techniques of growing crops by stressing on the maintenance of nutrition needs for plants, or in the everyday sense of growing crops without soil. This understanding shows that hydroponic planting techniques are beginning with a growing human concern for the importance of the need for fertilizer for plants. Wherever a plant grows, it can grow well when the nutrients needed are constantly sufficed. In this context the function of soil is for the buffers of plants and water that exist are nutrient solvents, to then be absorbed by plants. It's this thought pattern that eventually gave birth to hydroponic planting techniques, which are suppressed by nutrients. The hydroponics system can be used to deal with problems where land shortages are getting narrower and smaller. It is hoped that hydroponics can be a benefit to the future because they can be empowered in narrowland conditions. Initially, the breeding of plants that were landless was written in the book Sylvarum by Francis Bacon in 1627, printed a year after his death.",

At first he called it aquaculture (or in Indonesia called water culture), but then he found out that aquaculture had been applied to water animal culture.

The cardinals generally had an additional task, such as leading a diocese of both the diocese in general and the diocese of the stituler or the archdiocese and leading a department in Roman Kuria. But their most important function is to select a new Pope, when there is a void of the Roman diocese because of the death or resignation of the old Pope. The right to attend conclaves is now restricted to cardinals no more than 80 years old on the day of the pope's death. In 1059 the right to choose the Pope was reserved for the principal clergy of Rome and the bishops of the seventh diocese of \"the bicaria\" (the dioceses under the great diocese of Rome). That's why they're called \"cardinals,\" from the Latin word \"cardo,\" which means \"private,\" \"leader.\" In the 12th century it began to practice the appointment of Church officials from outside Rome as cardinals, each of these officials from outside Rome being assigned to one of the churches in Rome as \"tituler church\" concerned or associated with one of the seven fertile dioceses. The practice is still running until now. In official writing and pronunciation, there are two ways that are commonly used in cardinal placement.

The Holy Roman Emperor had a hand in the selection of Popes. But after the Pope gained greater political independence, the vote was given to cardinals in 1059. But the influence of world leaders back then, especially French kings, worked through cardinals from countries or certain important political movements; even developed traditions that allowed the heads of certain kingdoms - such as Austria, Spain, and Portugal - to present one of the clergy who was a citizen of his kingdom to be appointed cardinals. These kinds of cardinals have been called cardinals. According to his theory, the Pope was able to replace the Cardinal's Council with another election agency such as the Bishop's Synod to perform this function, but the proposal was not accepted, because, in addition to other reasons, the Bishop's Synod only attends when called by the Pope. At the beginning of modern times, British and French kings hired cardinals as Prime Ministers, as did Thomas Cardinal Wolsey in England, as did Cardinal Richelieu, Cardinal Mazarin and Cardinal Fleury in France.

The giant terrorized the people of Ekramura for some thirteen years, until finally the Milky Way of the Kuru Kingdom came and killed him. In the book of Bhagawatapura, Bakasura is a giant killed by the Kresna. In the book of Bhagawatapura, Bakasura is a giant, brother of Putana. He was commissioned by Kamsa to kill Kresna, after the giant Watsasura failed to do so. The bakasura takes form of a giant stork with a sharp beak. The giant flew to Wrindawana and disturbed young shepherds, including Kresna. After opening his large beak, the giant swallowed Kresna. But Kresna kicked Bakasura's inner neck so she regurgitated. Later, Kresna fought Bakasura. Kresna grabbed both of Bakasura's beaks and broke them in two. Not long after Bakasura died. In the Mahabharata it is said that the Bakasura delights in disturbing the people of Ekramura and killing people indiscriminately. To overcome the anxiety of the villagers, a rule was made for the residents to send a cart of food and a human before the giant Baka. The law was followed in turns and intended that Baka not attack the villagers severely. When the Pandas and their mothers lived in Ekramura, they didn't know that. At last the Bima (one of the Pandava) and the Kunti (the Pandava's mother) learned of the great ferocity of Baka from a brahana who had provided them a home. By order of Kunti, the Bima went to take a bag of food to the giant Baka cave, and planned to kill him.",

Some observers like Graham Fuller, argue that the teachings of Islamism are not as hard and tight as expected, and can be defined as a political form of identity, or support of Muslim identity, authenticity, broader regionalism, reanimation, and revitalization of Muslim communities. After the rise of the Arab world, Islamic politics was described as \"a growing interdependent\" by democratic politics. Muslimists generally oppose the use of this content, and claim that this political attitude and ideals are a form of their only Islamic expression.

Later it became known that there was also the use of a mixture of garlic, onions, and pepper or other foods, but it was not effective enough to kill insects. The use of synthetic insecticides began in the 1930s and began to expand after the end of World War II. In 1945 to 1965, insecticides of organochlorins were widely used for agriculture and forestry.

Structural threads are glues that have above 1000 psi strengths and have resilience to extreme environmental conditions (exposure to UV light, humidity and high temperature). Examples of structural glue are epoxy, acrylic thermoleting, and uretan. Structural tape usually consists of two components of glue and a hardener. A non-structural tie is a low-power glue. This type of tier is usually used either for temporary applications or in rooms that are not exposed to weather or extreme environmental conditions. Examples of this type of glue are duct tape, wood glue, elastomere and sealant. In general, the force of the glue is influenced by four factors: pressure, temperature, time and surface of the compressed material. Some types of glue like VHB require a minimum emphasis of 15 psi to activate the glue. The tier works well above 50 degrees Fahrenheit [15 \u00b0 C]. The time it takes to gain the maximum power depends on the type of glue, ranging from seconds like on a depatriate glue, up to a matter of days on some kind of epoxy.

In Hindu mythology, he is known as one of seven Ciranjiwis, condemned to live forever without love, after committing the murder of five Pandawa sons and trying to abort the fetus conceived by Utari, Abhimanyu's wife. The Mahabharata describes Aswatama as a tall man, with dark skin, black eyes, and a jewel on his forehead. Like Bisma, Drona, Krepa, Kara, and Arjuna, he was an expert in war and was viewed as one of the greatest warriors of his time. Aswatama also bears the title of marathi, and it is one of Korawa's top generals in the Kurukshetra war. After the war in Kurukshetra ended, only he was with Kertawarma and Krepa the survivors of Korawa. Consumed with vengeance for his father's death, he stormed Pandawa's camp in the middle of the night and carried out the massacre blindly. As is the case with the Parasurama Resi and the Fey Resi, Aswatama is also known as the leading resi. According to Hindu mythology, Aswatama will serve as the master of engineering in the 29th heaven, in the 7th world. Aswatama will also serve as one of the seven Great Resi (Septaresi) in the 8th person. According to the Mahabharata, Aswatama means \"sounding like a horse\" He was given such a name because of his cries at birth like the sound of a horse's ring. He was also known as Acaryandana (c\u0101ryanadana), meaning \"teacher's favorite son\" and Acaryaputra (Press), literally meaning \"master's son.\" Aswatama was the son of the Dronaese couple with Krepi's younger brother Krepa (the great priest of Hastinapura during the reign of the Kuru Dynasty kings).",

As a child he lived in poverty; the Mahabharata described that the Aswatama family could not even afford milk, a drink common to society at the time. In order to give Aswatama a better life, Drona tried to seek help from an old friend of hers named Drupa, but it led to hostility because Drupa insulted Drona's social status. Her family's social status changed after Drona was appointed a royal teacher by the Kuru Dynasty family in Hastinapura. He came to military science along with the princes of the Kuru Dynasty, a hundred Korawas (sons of Dretarastra, King Hastinapura) and five Pandawas (son of Pandu, sister of Dretarastra: Yudystira, Bima, Arjuna, Nakula, Sadive). His power is almost the same as Arjuna's, especially in archery. Among the princes of Kuru, he made good friends with Duryodana, the eldest son of Dretarastra. They both have jealousy towards the Pandawa. Duryodana felt that it was his barrier to inherit the throne of Hastinapura, while Arjuna's talent made Aswatama jealous of the feeling that his father's affection had been divided, because Arjuna was Drona's favorite disciple. In order to complete the education of the Kuru princes, Drona ordered the Korawas to perform the final task, which was to defeat Drudada, King Panchala, and bring him alive before Drona. After the Korawas failed to perform their duties, Drona sent Arjuna and her brothers to fulfill them. Arjuna managed to bring Dru to Drona's presence. Drona explained that her grudge against Drudai had ended at that very moment. He also divided the kingdom of Panchala into two territories, making Aswatama king in part of the Panchala region. When the war between Pandawa and Korawa broke out, Aswatham sided with Korawa.",

For the Tomataki, the synonggis are basic foods that have now experienced a shift in meaning and are competing with rice. Sinonggi is the main food of the Tomatak tribe made from the starch of the sago sari. In South Sulawesi, a similar dish is known as limestone and is called papeda in the Malum Islands. Although these dishes have a resemblance to the ingredients, the way they're presented is different. For a synonggi, cooked sago flour is not mixed with vegetables, fish sauces, sauces (\"daws\"), or other spices depending on each other's taste. For the Tokik tribe, synonggi was a basic food, but it has now become a secondary food substitute for rice during the pacyclic period. Although it is a Tokaki food, no one has known since when the Tombaya are eating synonggi. Yet, this food has existed hundreds of years ago like rice. Toyaki myth mentions that the sago tree of Sinonggi's raw material grew on its own in the village of Kuko Hulu in the Konaweha River, now called Old Latoma. In Tokilah, it's called \"sowurere,\" meaning \"a village that grows thousands of sago trees.\" It's right near Tongauna, Iwoi Ulu, Kolaka District. Another version says that the sago tree that grows in those swamps, actually comes from my shame. The name synonggi is believed to be local culturally derived from the word posonggi. Posonggi or o songgi (Tomanaki) is a chopstickslike tool made of bamboo that is smoothed at less than an inch [10 cm] in length. This is the tool that was used to retrieve synonggis from the place of the presentation. In a roll, the cynonggi is placed on a plate that has been filled with vegetable gravy and fish and other spices.",

She was the mother of King Bharata who brought down Bharata's family. He is also Kanwa Minister's adopted son. It's said that his birth mother is a grim reaper. The history of Sakuntala appears briefly in the book of Adiparwa. Legend has it that there was a recluse called Wiswamitra, who was once a king but then left his palace life because he wanted to achieve the glory of Wasitha's scholar. It's very fragile, unshakable. In view of that, the God of Indra sent an angel to test out the Wiswamitra. The angel of Menaka flies to the place where Wiswamitra lies, accompanied by Lord Bayu and Semara. When it reached its destination, the Menaka angel carried out her duty. The angel seduced the Wiswamitra so that her lust arose. The angel of Menaka was then knocked out by the Wiswamitra. After feeling the task was done well, the angel of Hell flew back to heaven while the Wiswamitra left her her her her cesspool for failure. On the river Malini, the angel gave birth to a baby girl. The baby was left alone there while her mother flew into heaven without love. Then the baby was taken care of by the Sakuni bird. Kanwa's group looking for flowers around Malini River was surprised to see a baby lying there, being cared for by a Sakuni bird. Then the baby was picked up, blessed, cared for, and named after the Sakuntala bird. Once upon a time, the Prabu Duswanta went hunting up into the middle of the forest at the foot of Mount Himawan. After deep into the forest, he found the location of a very beautiful hermit, which turned out to be Kanwa's Master's residence. There she was warmly welcomed by a beautiful princess named Sakuntala.",

Then the King made love to Sakuntala. Shortly thereafter, he left the hermitage because he was bound by his duty as king. She returned home and promised that she would return to the hermitage to pick up Sakuntala and her child when she was born. When Sakuntala remembers the King's departure, Kanwa's pod returned from the forest with flowers and firewood. Sakuntala is just silent. Because of its accuracy, Kanwa scholars knew what was happening to Sakuntala even though Sakuntala was silent. Kanwa scholars encouraged Sakuntala and gave her gentle words. Kanwa's advice soothes Sakuntala. From the result of his relationship with King Duswanta, a beautiful son was born, named after Sarwadamana. The signs are that he is the future ruler of the world seen from a chakra image in the palm of his hand. After his son was born, Sakuntala faithfully awaited the arrival of King Duswanta. But the King didn't come. Sakuntala's heart became even sadder thinking about the future of her son who had not been picked up as heir to the kingdom. Seeing this, Kanwa scholars told Sakuntala and her son to go to the king in the capital. Wanting his son to be king, Sakuntala willingly went to the capital. Upon reaching the capital city, Sakuntala appeared before the king in court at the royal palace. In public, Sakuntala explained the purpose of his arrival that he would give up his son, Sarwadaman, as the crown prince because of the King's promise.",

        "paragraph": "Ribonucleic acid (ARN, English: ribonucleic acid, RNA) is a polymer molecule involved in various biological roles in coding, decoding, regulation, and gene expression. RNA and DNA are nucleic acids, and, along with proteins and carbohydrates, are four major macromoleculles that matter to all known life forms. Like DNA, RNA is assembled as a nucleotide chain, but unlike DNA, RNA is more commonly found in nature as a single strand that folds to itself, than a double strand pairs. Cellular organisms use Ambassador RNA (British: messenger RNA, mRNA) to convey genetic information (using G, U, A, and C to show guain nitrogen bases, rasil, adenin, and cytosine (English: cytosine) that direct specific protein synthesis. Many viruses code their genetic information using the RNA genome. Some RNA molecules play an active role in the cell by catalyzing biological reactions, controlling gene expressions, or feeling and communicating responses to cellular signals. One of these active processes is protein synthesis, a universal function where mRNA molecules assemble proteins on ribosomes. This process uses the molecular RNA transfer (British: transfer RNA, tRNA) to give amino acids to ribosomes, where RNA ribosomals (English: ribosomal RNA, rrNA) then connects amino acids together to form proteins. The basic structure of RNA is similar to that of DNA. RNA is a polymer composed of a number of nucleotides. Each nucleotide has one phosphate group, one group of pentose, and one nitrogen base group. The polymer is composed of alternating bonds between the phosphate groups of one nucleotide with the pentose groups of the other nucleotides. The difference between RNA and DNA lies in one group of hydroxil rings of pentose sugar, calling it ribosa, while the group of pentose in DNA is called deoxyribose.",

So there are still four options: adenina, guanina, cytosina, or urasil for a nucleotide. Moreover, the form of RNA conformation is not a double pill as DNA does, but it varies according to its type and function. DNA can be found inside the nucleus or the nucleus of a cell and also within the nucleus fluid of a cell or a nucleusoid, while RNA is found inside the cytoplasm of a cell, a nucleus, and a ribosome. The DNA chain forms a double helix of two interlocked chains, while RNA consists of only one chain or single helix. RNA also has a much shorter nucleotide chain compared to the DNA chain. DNA consists of nitrogen guanine bases that pair with cytosine, and adenine that pairs with thymine. As for RNA, it's made up of nitrogen guanine bases that pair with cytosine, but unlike DNA, the RNA adenine pairs with urasil. From a function, DNA functions to store and lower genetic information over a long period of time. As for RNA, it serves as the carrier and translator of the genetic code for protein generation. RNA also serves to inhibit gene expressions to suppress tumor growth or cancer. RNA is present in nature in a variety of types. As a genetic material, RNA is a pair of double-stranged RNAs. Classic molecular genetics taught, in eukaryota there were three types of RNA involved in the process of protein synthesis: at the end of the 20th century and early 21st century it was known that RNA was present in various forms and engaged in the posttranslation process. In the genetic expression settings people now know RNA-micro (myrNA) who are involved in the gene silence or gene syllencing and small-interfering RNA (syRNA) that are involved in the defense process of the virus attack.",

These underwater hot springs are hotter than surface water because water is under pressure. All hyperthermophyil with optimum temperatures above 100 \u00b0C comes from that area of the water. Crenarchaeota living in a cold habitat (or cold-dwelling Crenarchaeota) can be identified by non-thermal environmental samples by analyzing 16S ribosomal RNA encoder genes. Crenarchaeota in the water environment can be found in cold water and ice seas such as those found in intertika. This group of microorganisms is planktonic, which means freely suspendive or attaches to water - suspended particles.",

Almost all species of Crenarchaeota hyperthermophyil are anaerobic bacteria that perform chemoorganotrophs or chemolitophs. The Crenarchaeota thermophyil type rarely perform fermentation and obtain anaerob respiration energy. Between species that one and the other have electron donors and different electron acceptors. The energy conservation mechanism performed during the respiration process is the transfer of electrons inside the cytoplasm membrane that activates the proton pump and ATP can be made from proton translocation by ATPase. Part of Crenarchaeota anaerob uses H2 as an electron donor and S0 or NO3 as its acceptor. Other chemolitroph activities involve S0 and Fe2+ aerob or Fe2+ anaerobically with NO3-- as electron acceptor. ",

Then he swam to reach for the box, and found that there was a baby in it. It was also wrapped in armor and earrings. After picking up the baby, Adirata immediately told her, Radha. Then they named the baby Basusena, because when it was found, the child was accompanied by a suit of armor and earrings. However, Adirata used to call her Radheya, a matronimic in Sanskrit which literally means \" Radha's son.\" According to the Book of Wanaparwa, after Adirata raised a child, soon his wife gave birth to several sons. Adirata and Radha took care of Radheya lovingly. By the time Radheya was sixteen, Adirata bought him a carriage and a horse. But Radheya's interest leads to the science of war and arrow.

Literally, the name Parashurama means \"Rama armed with axes.\" Another name is Bhargalwa, meaning \"the offspring of the Bregu Maharesi.\" He himself was known as Vishnu's sixth awatara and lived in the days of Tretayuga. In these days many knights fought each other so that they caused chaos in the world. So Vishnu as the god of the universe was born into the world as a haunted brahman, Rama the son of Jamadagni, to crush the knights. Parasturama is Jamadagni's youngest son, a Bregu-resitor. That is why he is also known as Bhargawa. When Jamadagni was born, he named his son Rama. As an adult, Rama became known as Parasurama, who always carried an axe as his weapon. In addition, Parasaturama also has another powerful bow. As a young man Parasurama once killed his own mother, whose name was Renuka. This was because Renuka's mistake in serving the needs of Jamadagni caused her husband to become angry. Jamadagni then ordered his sons to kill their mother. He promised to grant whatever they asked. Nevertheless, as a child, the sons of Jamadagni, except for Parasaturama, no one was willing to do it. Jamadagni grew angry and cursed them to stone. Parasaturama as the youngest and smartest son turned out to be willing to kill his own mother. After Renuka's death, he made a request according to Jamadagni's promise. Among these requests, Jamadagni had to revive and receive Renuka back, and restore her four brothers to human form. Jamadagni also felt proud and fulfilled all the requests of Parasaturama.",

It is said that Parasaturama is determined to wipe out all warriors from the face of the earth. It has even been told that it has traveled around the world three times. After feeling good enough, Parasaturama has performed a sacred sacrifice ceremony somewhere called Samantapancaka. In the future, it will be known by the name Kurukshetra and considered a sacred land that will be a great civil war between the Pandawa and Korawa families. The reason why Parasturama is determined to wipe out the knights is because of the deeds of the king of Hehaya, Kartawurya Arjuna, who has snatched Jamadagni's cow. Parasaturama got angry and killed the king. But on the next occasion, Kartawurya Arjuna's children took revenge by killing Jamadagni. It's the death of Jamadagni that increases the hatred of Parasaturama for the entire warrior class. Although the number of warriors killed by Parasturama is countless, there are still others left alive. Among other things, the powerful Wangsa Surya of Ayodhya, the Kingdom of Kosala. One of the descendants of the money was Sri Rama son of Kabatata. One day he won a victory in the Mithila Empire for Sita's daughter of the country.

Like other interconnected geological periods, such as the soil layer that determines the beginning and end of this period is well identified, but the date has exactly 5-10 million years of uncertainty. The beginning of the Silang period was determined on a major extinction event when 60% of the marine species were destroyed. During the early Silang period, the dominant fauna community came from a group of Pentamerus yaotu brachiopods (lightbacks) of the species Pentamerus oblongus. This community is known to live in sun - exposed areas of water because they are associated with strong chalked green algae. Waters occupied are areas with stable wave activity and not too shallow, because pentamerid brakiopods will lose pedicles as adults. The pentamerid community thrived at a depth of maybe 30 to 60 meters (100 to 200 feet). In this period (some other references say that this occurred during the Ordovicium period), for the first time, non-microbial organisms rose to land, in the form of moss colonies growing near wet areas like rivers and lakes.

At the time, according to the president of VAVA, Erick Thohir, this television broadcast was to be carried out in a territorial network with a local station in Indonesia (probably as done by TV and RTV Compasses). However, in another statement in March 2012, Erick stated that the channel would be aired on subscribed television, and in preparation he had sought the rights of a number of sports competitions. Although Erick had already stated on the occasion that this TV would be enjoyed in early 2013, it was not until July 2013 that the SportOne was just aired on a digital broadcast of the VEVA channel in Jakarta.

Hermaphrodit not only happens to animals and plants, but also to humans. It's important to know that hermaphrodit is not the same as intersex. In intersexual humans, both organs can't fully function. Hermafroditism is not widely known in the animal kingdom (Animalia) but is very common in plants (Plantae). Gastropods that live on land (e. g. snails and naked snails) are a classic example of hermaphroditism in the animal world. The species of hermaphrodites are all that have the possibility of pollinating themselves (self pollination). They are perfect flowering plants (flowers that have male genital organs, silk, and females, which are putique) or with male and female flowers in one individual. Nevertheless, a number of plant species develop certain systems to prevent self-fertilization. Hermaphrodit consists of 2 types: In humans, biological hermaphroditism has not been discovered. The hermaphrodite word that usually refers to humans is an error for intersex. Those words add confusion to laity with the social symptoms of transgenderism. An intersex has often two genitalia (penis or testicles with vagina or ovaries), and it can be hidden inside the body. On the hidden genitalia, family and even intersex themselves would be confused. The Castor Semanya Olympics are a good example. The society's understanding of intersex and gender is still very primitive, society is fixated on correcting through surgery and hormone and psychology therapy, what might have been created deliberately. A transgender is an individual with a physical opposite to the role of the gender he's running.

Initially, archea was classified as a bacteria and was named after archaeacteria (in Archaebacteria kingdom), but this classification was no longer used. Archea cells have a unique trait that separates archea from two other domains of life, Bacteria and Eukaryota. The Arkea is divided into several filums. The classification is difficult because the majority of the archea has not been isolated in the lab and only detected the gene sequence from samples taken from the environment. Arkea and bacteria generally have similar sizes and shapes, although some archea have very strange shapes, such as flat, rectangular cells like Haloquadratum walsbyi. Although there are morphological similarities between archea and bacteria, archea has genes and several metabolic pathways that are more similar to eukaryota, especially enzymes involved in transcription and translatation. One aspect of the archea biochemical unique is the dependency of the archeatic lipid ether on their cell membranes. Arkea uses more energy than eukaryota, which ranges from such organic compounds as sugar, ammonia, metal ions, or even hydrogen gas. The salt - tolerant Arkea (Haloarchaea) uses sunlight as a source of energy, while other species of archea fixate carbon; yet, unlike plants and phenobacterials, no archea does both. Arkea reproduces sexually with binary division, fragmentation, or shoots. Unlike bacteria and eukariota, no species of archea are known to form endospora.

They are part of microbiota for all organisms. As a human microbiota, archeatics play an important role in the colon, oral cavity, and skin. Morphological, metabolic, and geographical diversity allows them to have a broad ecological role, such as in carbon fixation in the carbon cycle, a role in the nitrogen cycle, the rotation of organic compounds, and the preservation of symbiotic communities and microbial synths. No clear example has been found for pathogenic or parasitic archea. On the other hand, archea is often a qualityist or a commensurate, such as a methane that lives in human digestive tracts and ruminansia, where they live in large quantities and helps the digestive. Metanogens are used in biogas production and waste processing. Meanwhile, enzymes from extremists that can survive high temperatures and organic solvents are used in biotechnology. In most of the 20th century, procariota was considered a group of organisms and was classified based on their biochemical, morphological properties, and metabolism. Microbiologists try to classify microorganisms based on the structure of cell walls, shapes, and substances they consume. In 1965 Linus Pauling and Emile Zuckerkandl proposed using gene sequences in various procaritas to identify their relationship with one another. This approach, known as phylogenetics, is the primary method used today. The Arkea (was the first known metanogen) was first classified as a separate group of bacteria on a filogentic tree based on their RNA ribosomal (rRNA) gene sequence by Carl Woese and George E.

According to Hindu teachings, these four times formed a cycle, much like the four - season cycle. The cycle starts with Satyayuga, heading for Kaliyuga. Once Kaliyuga is over, the new Satyayuga begins. The turn of time from Satyayuga (golden doom) to Kaliyuga (the scourge of darkness) is a fact that the teachings of truth and consciousness as a religious community will gradually diminish, as mankind grows and the changes of time. Where in the end humans will feel that at some old age, when the earth is rent, when moral and cultural decay has gotten worse, then it's time for the end of the world. When compared to the Dharma Ox (a symbol of morality development), the four cycles of the Yuga (Caturyuga) are like the ox standing on its four feet, where every age changes, the calf's foot also decreases one, a symbol of morality that diminishes every age. The Satyayuga age was like an ox standing on four legs, a solid morality. The Tretayuga times were like oxen standing on three legs. The Dwaparayuga period with two legs, and the time of the Yuga Kali with only one leg. In those days, morality lost its stand. The cycle began in the golden age (Satyyuga), and ended in the dark ages (Kaliyuga).

After Mahayuga went on for 71 times, there was a period called Manwatta. After 14 Manwataras went on, a period called Kalpa was reached. According to Hindu teachings, by the time that period was reached, the universe was destroyed. According to the characters of each age, there are things that matter, namely: in Chessyuga, every age that lasts has a period of time. According to one traditional calculation, each age has a different period of time, and if combined, it will form a period called the 1 Mahayuga. Briefly described as below: That period became the basis of a well - known calculation, as the book of Bhagawadgita is described by the Visnual Om A.C.B. Swami Prabhudi.

Prosa literature is divided again into fiction prose and nonfiction prose. Fiction prosa includes fairy tales, short stories, and novels, while nonfiction proses include biography, autobiography, and essays. The main feature of prose is the use of words that don't pay attention to rhythm patterns or rhymes. Prosa has a nature that exposes things and contains very little literary value. Prosa exposure can be said to be a literary work in which there are various events, introductions of figures and the use of fiction. The action within one unit of space and time is a sign of an event. The existence of space and time cannot be called an event if there is no action in it. But interest always involves the person in it. The events that occur in sequence and sustainability are the result of the action of the character. The figures and events described in the prose are fictitious. Prosa delivery does not focus on using the elements of poetry beauty.

A medical degree was first given by Schola Medica Salernitana about 1000, including being given to a woman, the Trota of Salerno. This title was legally recognized in 1137 by Ruggeru II of Sicily and in 1231 by Emperor Friedrich II, in the Constitution of Melfi.

This title was given after a three - year study process of learning logic, five - year medical studies, committee exams from professors, one - year apprenticeship with expert doctors, and the final exam of the Curia Kingdom Committee and Curia Province. In 1703 the first medical graduate of the University of Glasgow, Samuel Benion, was given an academic degree in Doctor of Medicine. Medical education in England was given an MB (Bachelor of Medicine), and in Scotland an MD title was given. Until the mid - 19th century, medical practitioners in Scotland and England were required to hold a double - degree in medicine and a joint degree in surgery. North American medical school has moved on from this ancient tradition in Scotland, and has started using MDs since the end of the 18th century. The King's Medical College was the first university in the United States to use an MD instead of MB. The first medical school in North America to give the title Doctor of Medicine was Columbia, University of Pennsylvania, University of Harvard, University of Maryland, and McGill University. Most of the North American medical schools were founded by trained doctors and surgeons from England and Scotland. The feminine form of MD, either \"Doctress of Medicine\" or Medicinae Doctrix, was also used by the New England Female Medical College in Boston in the 1860s to replace the title Doctor of Medicine. In most countries around the world, having a medical degree does not mean that the person will be allowed to practice medical science. A doctor generally has to go through the registration process and take the state exam.",

When Drudai quarreled with Drona, Satyajit stood up for his king. Drona sent the Korawas to capture Drudada. Although it brought Hastinapura's forces in great numbers, the Korawas were unable to face Satyajit's power that fought hard to protect Drudai. At last the Korawas returned with failure. Drona then sent her other students, the Pandavas. The five princes left without an army. Yet they managed to capture Drudada. Satyajit himself was defeated by Arjuna. In the Baradaya War, Drona sided with Korawa, while Dru on favoring Pandawa.

Flagella is involved in the cell's chemoxic response. Flagella can attach to cells in different places. In the polar position, one flagella attaches to one side of the cell. However, the number of flagellas can become numerous and morphic. Flagella can often be seen without any coloring, simply using a contrast phase microscope.

Propane is sold as fuel, propane is also known as LPG (liquified gas - gas gas petroleum liquid) which can be mixed with small amounts of propena, butna, and butena. Sometimes it's also added ethaneiol as a odor material in order to be used as a detection for leakages. In North America, the main composition of LPG is propane (at least 90%), with an additional butane and propena. This is the HD5 standard, which was originally made mainly for vehicle fuel. Propana has a burning reaction similar to that of other alkanas. In excess oxygen state, propane burns and forms water and carbon dioxide. If there's not enough oxygen for perfect combustion, then imperfect combustion happens when propane burns and forms water, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide. Unlike natural gas, propane weighs heavier than air (1.5 times denser). In a raw state, the propane will be at the bottom. Liquid propane will evaporate at atmospheric pressure and appear white due to the condensation of water vapor from the air. When it burns right, propane generates about 50 MJ / kg. Dirty heat burns one cubic meter of propane is about 91 megajole. Propana is not toxic, but if inhaled will cause a mild asphyxiation due to lack of oxygen.

The Baku was divided over 11 districts, such as Azizbayov, Binagadi, Garadagh, Narimanov, Nasimi, Nizami, Sabail, Soapchu, Khatai, Surakhany and Yasamal and 48 cities. Among them are the islands in the Baku Gulf and Oil Cadas built in the Caspian Sea, 60 km (37 mi) from Baku. The Baku name has long been recorded in the Persian Arabic script. The earliest Arabic sources of this city refer to it as B\u0101kuh and B\u0101kuya, both likely from Persian, although its origins are not yet clear. The local popular 19th - century story tells us that it is possible that the name Baku came from the word \"angin\" and kube, which in Persian means \"town hit by the wind,\" meaning \"to hit.\" This term is used to refer to a Baku known as its strong winds, as well as to experience less friendly winter storms.",

Because Yati refused to inherit the throne, Yayati was made king, even though he was not the firstborn son. Yayati married Deiyani and Sarmista, and brought down five sons. The story of Yayati can be found in the Mahabharata, Brahmapurana, Naradapurana, Matshapura, Bhagawatapurana and others. The Bibles have different versions of Yayati, but the core of the story remains the same. The story of Yayati was found in Adiparwa, the first of the Mahabharata. It is told that when Yayati went hunting, he stopped at a well to quench his thirst. When he looked into the well, he found a woman lying down there. Yayati helped the woman get out of the well. The woman claims to be Deyani, daughter of Mahaguru Sukra, teacher of the asuras. He was driven by Sarmista, his own servant, for the sake of clothing. After the meeting, Yayati and Godyani fell in love. For his service in helping the Godyani, Sukra got her daughter married to the king. Sukra also ordered the king not to marry Sarmista, a servant of the Godyani. The king accepted it. From the results of his marriage, Yayati and Dehanyani were blessed with two sons, the firstborn named Yadu and the youngest called Turwasu. Once, Sarmista approached Yayati sitting alone in the garden. He persuaded the king to marry her. The king refused, but was always seduced, until the king finally broke his wedding promise. She was secretly married to Sarmista. From the result of his marriage, the king had three sons. The firstborn was named Druhyu, who was named Anu, the youngest named Puru.",

In Indonesia, only Sumatra, Kalimantan, and Papua have larger territories as well as only the islands of Java and Sumatra have more populations than Sulawesi. The landscape of Sulawesi includes four peninsulas, the North Peninsula, the East Peninsula, the South Peninsula, and the Southeast Peninsula.

In addition, Sulawesi is also located between the meeting of three tablets, the Eurasian Tablet, the Indo-Australia Tablet, and the Pacific Tablet. This led to Sulawesi having a very complex tectonic structure. The name Sulawesi is thought to be derived from words in the Middle Sulawesi, which means nusa (island) and the word mesi means iron (logam), which may refer to the practice of trading iron ore produced by mines around Lake Matano, near Sorowako, Eastern Luwu.

The Togean Islands are in the middle of Tomini Bay; the island of Peleng and the Proud Islands form an island cluster between Sulawesi and Maluku.

The most common form of concrete is Portland cement concrete, which consists of mineral aggregates (usually pebbles and sand), cement and water. It is commonly believed that concrete dries up after mixing and laying down. Actually, concrete isn't solid because water evaporates, but cement hydrates, compresses other components together and eventually forms materials like-rock. Concrete is used to build road violence, structure, foundation, roads, crossing bridges, parking structure, bases for fences, and cement in bricks or block walls. An old name for concrete is molten rock. In its development many new modified concrete, such as mild concrete, spray concrete (eng: shotcrete), concrete fiber, high-powered concrete, high-powered concrete, self-conceived concrete etc. Now concrete is the most widely used building material in the world. The use of concrete and volcanic materials like puzzolan ash as its shape has begun since the Greek and Roman times, perhaps even before. With a mixture of chalk, pullans, and pumices, the Romans built many infrastructures like aqueducts, buildings, drainages and so on. In Indonesia similar uses can be seen in some of the ancient buildings that remain. The Fort Indrapatra of Aceh built in the 7th century by the Lamuri empire, the building blocks of chalk, clay, and mountain stones. The Egyptians had discovered earlier that using volcanic dust additives was able to increase the strong pressure of concrete. The massive use of concrete began in the early 19th century and was the beginning of the boned concrete era. In 1801, F.Coignet published his writings on the principles of construction by reviewing the moisture of concrete materials against the impact.",

In addition, concrete also has excellent strength, resistant to high temperatures and cheap maintenance costs. While its flaws are shapes that have been made difficult to change without damage. In concrete structure, if the destruction is to be done, it's expensive because it can't be used anymore. Unlike the steel structure that remains valuable.

According to rough estimates, the pull's strong value is about 9%-5% strong. That's why loading is so necessary in concrete structures. Common weighting is the use of steel bones that are often associated with boned concrete. As mentioned earlier, concrete has a strong but strong pressure but a weak pull. For strong pressure, in Indonesia it is often used by kilograms/cm2 with the K symbol for cube and fc test objects for cylindrical objects.

Sydney is one of the world's most multicultural cities, reflected in her role as the principal destination city for immigrants to Australia. Australia's first British colony, Sydney, was founded in 1788 in Sydney Cove by Arthur Phillip, commodore First Fleet. In a cove in the Tasman Sea, Sydney was built on a low hill around Port Jackson. This town is where Sydney Opera House and Harbour Bridge stood. Its metropolitan region is surrounded by national parks, and it has many bays, rivers and niches. This town is a place for parks, such as Hyde Park, Royal Botanical Gardens and national parks. Along with Sydney Harbour, this is a major factor that made this city one of the most beautiful cities in the world. Sydney was considered an A+ world city, based on a list of the Loughborough University group in 2008 and ranked 16th among global cities based on the 2008 Global Cities Index by Foreign Policy.

People who practice Vegan lifestyle are called Vegans. Vegans are a more radical form of vegetarians. The term veganism was first presented in 1944 by Donald Watson, an English advocate who focused on animal rights and also a founder of The Vegan Society. Long before the 20th century, the concept of avoiding meat consumption existed since the development of civilizations of ancient India and the Eastern Mediterranean. In India's own culture, antiviolence or so - called ahimsa hints at the idea of life without flesh. The vegan name is derived from several letters from the term \"vegetarian\" to \"vegan.\" Basically the difference between vegetarians and vegans lies in the concept of diets, because vegetarians besides eating vegetable products, also consider foods that come from dairy and egg products. One of the earliest veganists was the Arab poet Al-Ma\u25aaarri (973-1057) who at one time left animal products to help his health and because of his belief in animal life and well-being. The modern veganism wave began in 1951 by The Vegan Society as an educational movement of diets that later turned into an animal rights group. Those who identify themselves as vegans usually have a goal of avoiding animal exploitation in all aspects of their life. The vegan diet includes all food intakes that come from animals and processed products such as meat, birds, fish, seafood, milk, eggs, mayonnaise and honey, and by - product such as butter, kasein, rennet and laktoserum (whey).",

The vegan diet also does not limit processed food as long as it does not contain material derived from animals. The vegan diet as a whole is healthy, but avoiding animal proteins can risk a lack of nutrients such as proteins, calcium omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin B12, vitamin D, potassium, seng, vitamin B2 and iodine. Proteins are needed to drive all chemical reactions inside the body, omega-3 fatty acids are used to keep the cells healthy, while calcium helps strengthen the bones and teeth. But most of those nutrients can be replaced by nutrients found in nabati-based foods. The body's need for proteins can be replaced by taking soybeans, kinoas, and so on. Omega-3 fatty acid can be found on hemps and vegetable supplements. Calcium can be obtained from soy milk, almons, and broccoli. Iron plays an important role in the production of red blood cells in order to help carry oxygen throughout the body. Iron found in non-meat sources such as raisins, wheat, know, or beans is harder to digest. It must be accompanied by foods that contain such vitamins as oranges and broccoli because it can help the body absorb iron. Being vegan means one has to avoid all foods that come from meat or processed products from its daily menu, to then switch to other kinds of foods that can be a substitute menu. Nutrientists have given substitute food recommendations that can meet the needs of the body's nutrients, among other things: someone who converts his lifestyle into vegans is driven for various reasons.",

Wheat is usually used to produce wheat flour, livestock feed, or fermentation to produce alcohol. Generally speaking, ocular wheat grains are of an opal length of 61'8 \"sm\" and 6\"3 mm in diameter. Like other types of cereals, wheat has a hard texture. The wheat grain consists of three parts of the skin (bran), part endosperma, and part of the institution (germ). Prehistoric society already knows the properties of wheat and other grain crops as a source of food. According to archaeological excavations, it is estimated that wheat came from areas around the Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea, areas surrounding Turkey, Syria, Iraq, and Iran. China's history indicates that wheat cultivation has existed since 2700 B.C.E. Wheat is a basic human food, livestock and industrial materials that use carbohydrates as the raw materials. Wheat can be classified based on the texture of wheat grain (kernel), the color of seed skin (bran), and the season of planting. Based on the texture of the kernel, wheat is classified as hard wheat, soft wheat, and durum wheat. Meanwhile, based on the color of bran, wheat is classified as red wheat and white wheat. For the harvest season, wheat is divided into winter wheat and spring wheat. In general, though, wheat is classified as hard wheat, soft wheat and durum wheat. The astivum triticum is the world's most grown wheat species and is widely used as a breadmaking material because it has high protein levels.

Saintis can be distinguished into two categories that is: Saintis studies certain aspects of nature in an organized, systemic way and through various classified scientific methods. The scope of science is limited to a range of things that the senses can understand (visions, touch, hearing, touch and taste) or can be said to be knowledge acquired through concrete learning and proof. Scientists aim to produce a useful model of reality and contribute to the development of natural science. Saintis knew some of the scientific methods used in practical terms: Until the end of the 19th or early 20th century, Saintis was simply referred to as the philosopher of nature. These daily reviews were so profound about philosophy that they could finally formulate a new theory to explain the various natural phenomena that took place. To date, the mention of Saintis is so seldom used that it is widespread. A scientist is generally a scholar with a degree in S. Si., although from another field of science he can also call himself Saintis.

Hermes functions are important because when there is a misunderstanding about the messages of the gods, the result will be fatal to all mankind. Hermes must be able to interpret or subvert a message into the language used by his listeners. Since then the Hermes has been a symbol of an ambassador charged with a specific mission. The success of the mission was entirely dependent on the way the message was delivered. Hence, hermeneutics were ultimately defined as \u25aa Processes of changing something or the situation of ignorance into understanding the matter. As a scientific term, Hermeneutic was introduced first since the emergence of Aristotle's basic book of logic, Peri Hermelias. Since then the concept of logic and the use of rationality has been introduced as the basis of hermeneutist action. This concept was brought to the tradition of some religions when they entered the Middle Ages. Hermeneutics are defined as actions of understanding God's messages in his scriptures rationally. In Christian tradition, from the 3rd century C.E. onward, the dense church with paripatetic traditions used Aristotle's concept of the offer to interpret the Bible.

Hermeeneutics then came out of philology discipline even beyond the point of four medieval interpretations when Schleiermacher claimed that interpretation was far more common than simply seeking meaning from a text. He then made hermeutics a new philosophy discipline. This was approved and developed by Wilhelm Dilthey at the end of the 19th century C.E., where he combined the concepts of history and philosophy and avoided the dogma of metaphysics to give birth to a new understanding of Hermeneutics. He then understood that the hermeneutic process is something that's learned, so it has to continue to process in every generation. Although it gives rise to intermittent understanding, dynamic scientific relationships play a vital role in reuniting understanding in an objective perspective. The 20th century C.E., marked as a posmodern era in the history of Western philosophy, phenomenology was born as a new understanding of the world's hermeneutics. It was Martin Heidegger, who said that the hermeneutic process was a process of self-explanation and the real problem of human existence. His business got a positive response from Hans-Georg gadamer who then combined Hermenautika Heidegger with the concept of aesthetics. They both agree that Yang-There is trying to show itself through the actions committed by humans, especially the language.

The shape of the body is like that of a fish without fins, elongated flats, transparent. Notochorda, dorsal nerves, and faring crevices developed nicely. Heartless circulatory system. The blood flow in the ventral section flows forward, while the dorsal side flows backward. It has a toucher in its mouth called a razor. On the edge of the anterior are eye spots and embers. Sexual reproduction, separate sex and external fertilization. Usually life is buried beneath the sands of shallow waters. Take Branchiostoma sp. (amphioxus). Cephalochordata uses filtering systems to consume microorganisms. The oral hood acts as an entrance to the food particles, and it has an open circuit, which helps to filter larger food particles before they enter the opening cavity. The epitel silia that coats the mouth and faring forms a special \"wheel organ\" located at the end of the dorsal and the posterior cavity. Silia's movements resemble spinning wheel motion and carrying captured food particles. Behind the wheel organ is a velum, which acts as an internal filter before food enters the faring. Food particles stick to the mucus secreted on the faring trunks before being brought to the epibranchial grooves on the faring back side. After this, food was transferred to the intestine, and excess water was pumped from the faring through the faring crevices. This excess water passes through the atriopore and then is removed from the body. Cephalochordata is known as Lancelet. Lancelet lives as bentos in shallow sand and only his head rises upward. The body is coated with epidermis without kutikula or tunic. Between miomer one and the other limited to mioceptta in a study conducted by Blair and Hedges in 2005, they used protein sequence data from 75 different proteins to determine that the cephalordata was different from the rest of the subphylum chordate about 891 million years ago.",

The thing that makes eukaryotic cells different from procaratic cells (Bacteria and Archaea) is that they have a membraneous organelle, especially the nucleus, which contains genetic material, and is wrapped up in a nuclear envelope. The name Eukaryota is used because of the nucleus, derived from the Greek \u25aa (eu, \"good\") and \u25aaO\u03bd (karyon, \"can\" or \"kernel\"). Eukaryotic cells also contain other memmetric organelles such as mitochondria and Golgi bodies. In addition, plants and algae contain chloroplasts. Eukaryotic organisms may be unicellular or multicellular. Only the eukaryota has many different kinds of tissues made up of different types of cells. Eucariota can reproduce both through asexual reproduction through mitosis and sexual reproduction through meiosis. In mitosis, one cell divides to produce two genetically identical cells. In meiosis, DNA replication is followed by two rounds of cell division to produce four child cells each with half the number of chromosomes from its mother cell (haploid cell). These cells act as sex cells, each gamet has only one complement of chromosomes, each unique mixture of a pair of appropriate parent chromosomes produced from genetic recombination during meiosis. Eukaryota Domain seemed monofiletic, and made one of three domains of life. The other two domains, Bacteria and Archaea, are procariota and have no description above. Eukariota is a small minority of all living things. However, because they are much larger in size, the collective eukaryota biomass worldwide is estimated to be about the equivalent of procariota. Eukariota first developed about 1.6-2.1 billion years ago. In general, the cell of the eukaryota is larger than the procaritata and has sub-cellular parts called organelles and cytoskeletons that are made up of microtubules, microfilaments and filaments between.",

In addition to performing asexual cell division, most eukaryota can also perform sexual reproduction through the process of cell fusion, which is not found in procariota. Eukaryotic cells have various membrane-bound structures, collectively called endomebran systems. Simple space, called vesicles or vakuolas, can form with separation from other membranes. Many cells swallow food and other materials through a process called endocyteosis, where the outer membrane melts into the inside and then breaks off the vesicle. Many other membrane organelles may come from such vesicles. The nucleus is coated by a double membrane, which has pores that allow the materials to go in and out. Various propagation of tube - shaped nuclear membranes or sheets forms the endoplasm (or RE) reticulum, which is involved in transport and protein manufacturing. REs are made up of rough REs that have attached ribosomes, and those synthesized ribosome proteins enter the inner space or lumen. Then, usually they enter the vesicle, which is separated from the fine RE. In most eukaryota, the protein - bearing vesicle is released and modified on a pile of vesicles called Golgi or dictiosom. Vesicel can specialize in various uses. For example, the lisosome has enzymes that describe the contents of food vakuolas, and the peroxysom with which it describes peroxide, which is toxic. Many protozoas have contractile vacuums, which collect and dispose of excess water and extrusoms, which secrete materials used to fight predators or catch prey. On high-level plants, most of the cell space is filled by central vakuola, which is its primary function to maintain osmotic pressure. Mitochondria is an organelle found in almost all eukariota.",

Aapcoplast comes from red algae through the endombiotic process that occurred at the beginning of eukaryotic evolution. Most of the aposplexes are unicellular endoparocytes in animals that cause some tropical diseases. Except for Nephromyce, which is a mutualism symbiosis between a firecomplexa and marine animals, which was originally classified as cythrid fungus. A firecombexa which is an endoparasit raises hope where a fireclast can be a drug target for two reasons. The first reason is, apicoplasmoplasmodium and Toxoplasm defense. The second reason is that effective drugs to procariatic organism are likely to be effective against firecoplasm, since plastid originally evolved from endosymbiotic cynotic cynobacteria procariots. The apicomplexa is highly dependent on the apicoplasm, which leads to speculation that this organelle is a parasitic protensitivity of heels like Plasmodium. The name taxon Apicomplex is derived from two Latin words called apex (top) and complex (infold), which refers to a set of organelles in sporozoite.

It was presented in the Act of Number 14 in 2005 about Teachers and Teachers Article 1 3 as saying that the professor or professor is the highest functional position for teachers who are still teaching in the educational community. If previously a professor with an academic degree of magister (S2), even a scholar (S1) could become a professor, then since 2007 only those who have an academic degree can become professors. This is because only this professor has the authority to guide the future doctor. As experts, professors generally have four additional obligations: 1.

Dun Holm, whose real name was Nordic, was changed to Duresme by the Normans, and was known as Dunelm in Latin.

These conclusions can be built and found through two issues of special premise and common premise. Sylogism makes the thinking systematic and clear, because silogism gives you room to think critically in order to distinguish valid arguments. The existence of a philosopher Aristotle was so closely related to Sylogism. He assumed that there were two logical forms of conclusion, one of which was this sylogism. Aristotle's philosopher gave a silogistic picture of his traditional logic in which silogism was interpreted as a deductive way of drawing conclusions by attracting general and special premise. In general, silogism is also divided into such sections as categorical sylogism, hypothetic sylogism, and disjungtive sylogism. The logic in Islam is known as mantiq science as a code of thinking by Aristotle then began to develop in the Islamic world. Since the coming of this time, there has certainly been many responses from the scholars and the Muslim thinkers. Some of these sentences are questions, news, active or passive and so on.

He wrote six books relating to logic that, Categoriae (concerning sylitica Posteriora), de interpretatiae (continuing about decisions), Analytica Priora (confession about sylitica Posteriora), Topics (confessing tentag techniques), and De Sophisticis Elenchis. From that comes the term silogism. The definition of aristotelesis defines silogism as a discourse in which it states something to follow the needs of an existence. But in practice it's so limiting that terms in arguments contain places and conclusions that each one is categorical proposition. The inventor of sylogist thinking was a famous philosopher of his time. He thinks this silogism consists of two premises and one conclusion. Aristotle mentioned that silogism was so related to premises early and second to existing decisions.

The stargazer itself is used to see an object from a distance so that it becomes clearer. In the sense of stargazers, it is also explained that these binoculars use two positive lenses. Where each lens serves as an objective lens and an ocular lens. This is what distinguishes stargazers from telescopes. In the stargazer, the focus distance of the objective lens is greater than the focus distance of the ocular lens.",

It has been widely used since the 4th century B.C.E. for use in marine and astronomical matters. Although telescopes have existed hundreds of years before mass, there is no record in history that explains who discovered the object first. Only, on October 2, 1608, it was recorded by a Hans Lippershey who tried to obtain patents for the telescope he created. However, this Luppershey attempt failed to get a rejection from the appropriation team. Because, they say, before Lippershey registered the patent, many of the telescopes that existed before them had been found. So according to them, it's not a patent from Lippershey. The following year exactly in 1609, Galileo created a telescope that came to be called stage scopes. Many refer to it as Galileo's binoculars. After making these binoculars, Galileo often made different types of telescopes and then succeeded in making several astronomical discoveries. These discoveries later made them known in world history. By large, the binoculars themselves are divided into two major categories. The first is a biased scope, a type of stargazer composed of several lenses. The second type is reflecting binoculars, which are the type of binoculars arranged from several mirrors and lenses.

Many modern interpreters agree with this statement. Michael is one of the principal angels of Abrahamic tradition. His name is said to be a battle cry for the angels in the battle they fought in heaven against Satan and his followers. In late Middle Ages Christianity, Michael together with St. George became protector of the knights, and protector of the first warrior order of France, the Order of Saint Mikael in 1469. In the honor system of Britain, a warrior class was formed in 1818 and was also named after these saints, the Order of St. Michael and St. George.

Well, in order not to harden like a rock, the potion is powdered and smoothed into small particles like powder. To achieve certain powers, Portland cement collaborates with other materials. When it meets water, for example, it produces a chemical reaction that can turn the potion into rock hard. In addition to sand, a solid wall of glue was created.

In brakiopods, a pedicle like a stalk stands out from a hole in one of the valves, known as a pedikel valve, tethers animals to the ocean floor but free from the mud that will block the opening. The word \"brakiopod\" is formed from the word in ancient Greek They are often known as \"lantern shells,\" because the curved shells of the Terebratulide class look somewhat like pottery oil lamps.

The nose is an instrument of the human senses that responds to stimulated odors or chemicals of gas. Inside the nostrils, there are embalming nerve fibers equipped with embalming cells, about 10-20 million embers. Each embalming cell has fine hair on its end and is covered by mucus membranes that serve as a nasal cavity moisturizer. When we breathe, a chemical of gas joins the nose. The chemicals that are a source of smell will dissolve in the mucus membrane, then stimulate the fine hairs on the ember. The embalming cell will pass this on to the brain to be processed so that it can know what kind of chemical smell it is. Inside the nostrils, air adjusts temperature and humidity. This process is done through a bulkhead of the nostrils (concha nasalis). In a nostril (left or right) there are three conchae that divide the cavity into three sections. By the time it passes the conchae, air will be adjusted to heat or cold temperatures. The overheating air will lower its temperature and the too cold will warm it up.

Needs reference] Music is known from the presence of modern Homoens, which is about 180,000. to 100,000 years ago. No one knows when humans began to know art and music. From archaeological discoveries to such locations as the African continent, some 180,000 years to 100,000 years ago there has been a change of evolution in the human brain. With a brain smarter than an animal, humans designed a more targeted hunt so that they could hunt down large animals. With this ability of the brain, humans can think further beyond reason and use imagination and spirituality. The language of communication has been formed among humans. From languages and simple utterances to danger signs and giving names to animals, slowly some vocabulary appears to name objects and give nicknames to people. In a moving life, the ancient man may have been inspired to take the bones of the dried legs of a hunted animal into his food and then blow it and make a sound. Others find inspiration when they look at nature by blowing out a wooden or bamboo cavity that emits a sound.",

He is Bhattiya's son. The expansion of his kingdom, particularly the execration of the Anga empire to the east, is considered to have laid the foundation for the expansion then of the Maurya Empire. He was also known for his cultural achievements and was a friend and protector of the Buddha. Bimbisara built the city of Rajgir, famous for the writings of Buddhism. His son, Ajatashatru took his place on the throne. The first capital of Bimbisara was in Girivja (identified with Kinggriha). He led a military campaign against Anga, perhaps to avenge his previous father's defeat at the hands of his king, Brahmadatta. The campaign was successful, Anga was expiated, and Prince Kunika (Ajatasatru) was appointed governor of Champa. Bimbisara uses the alliance of marriage to strengthen his position. His first wife was Kosala Devi, daughter of Mah\u0101 Kosala king of Kosala, and sister to Prasenajit. The bride-to-be brought her Kashi, who was then just a village, as a dowry. This marriage also ended enmity between Magadha and Kosala and gave him a free hand in dealing with other countries. His second wife, Chellana, was the daughter of Lichchhavi of Vaishali and daughter of King Chetaka. According to Indologist Hermann Jacobi, Vardhaman Mahavira's mother, Trishala is Chetaka's sister. His third wife, Kshema, was the daughter of the Madra chief of Punjab. This alliance opened the way for the expansion of the Magadha Empire both west and north.

Squirrels have a relatively large brain. The enormous ratio of brains comparable to the body on squirrels is the greatest in living things, even beating humans. The squirrel was once separated from the rows and moon rats that remained within the Insectivoras, and transferred into a primate nation of sloths, lionapulars, monkeys and apes. This transfer is due to the internal resemblance of the squirrel to the monkey nation, which is considered to be the early primate class.

The word evolved from the Latin word, spectre, which means ghosts, but the modern meaning now comes from its use in natural science. The first use of the word spectrum in natural science is in the field of optics to describe the rainbow of colors in light as it is expressed by a prism, and since then it has been applied as an analogy in many other areas. Now it's also used to describe the range of broad circumstances or behaviors that are grouped together and studied under a topic for ease of discussion, such as 'spectrum of political opinion', or 'the job spectrum of a drug', etc. At this use, prices in a spectrum don't need to be described exactly as an optical number. In the most modern use of the spectrum, there is a 'unitation theme' between extremes at both ends. In the 17th century, the spectrum word was introduced into the field of optics, to refer to the range of colors that are observed when white light is propagated by a prism. Immediately it refers to light intensity plots as functions of frequencies or wavelengths. The term spectrum is then immediately applied to other waves, such as sound waves, and is now applied to all signals that can be deciphered into frequency components. A spectrum is usually a two-dimensional plot of a set of signals, describing its components in other sizes. Sometimes, the word spectrum refers to the array of signals itself, as in \"spectrums of visible light,\" which is an electromagnetic wave that can be pierced by the human eye.",

Mechantilism includes national economic policy that aims to collect monetary reserves through positive trade balance, especially goods so. Historically, the policies often led to war and were also motivated to expand colonially. Memchantilis theory varies in its latest application from one writer to another and has evolved over time. High fares, especially on manufacturing goods, are almost universal features of mercantilical policy. Other policies include: Or it could be said that an economic theory that the well-being of a country is determined only by the amount of assets or capital stored by the country involved, and that the magnitude of the global trade volume is very important. Economic assets or national capital can be described in real terms by the amount of capital (mineral value, especially gold and other commodities) owned by the state and capital by increasing exports and preventing (perhaps) imports so that trade balances with other countries will always be positive. Mechantilism teaches that the government of a country must achieve this goal by taking protection against its economy, by encouraging exports (with many incentives) and reducing imports (usually with large rates). The economic policy that works with these mechanisms is called the memechantilism economic system. The dominant mechantilism teaching was taught in the entire European school at the beginning of the modern period (from the 16th to the 18th century, an era in which national awareness had already begun).",

The goal of the mechanistic economic policy is to build countries, especially at the age of extreme warfare, and the state has to find a way to strengthen the economy and weaken foreign enemies. Now, all European economists between 1500 and 1750 are considered to be mercantilists, although the term \"mechantilist\" has yet to be known.

Scientists classify animals based on an organization level such as tissues and organs that only high-level animals have, so the Placozoa that has nothing above is considered to be the most basalt (or most basic animal in the filogentic tree). But the absence of tissue or organs may be due to the loss of this feature in the next generation (an example of a chodrostei like a sturgeon fish consists of most cartilage, but scientists put it in a group of hard-boned fish, because it is relatively close to them than cartilious fish like Pari and Shark; Fish Sturgeons lose most of the bone processes that their ancestors have), thus classification with no tissue or tissue or organs could be used as a cluster.",

The kingdom of Samaria conquered Assyria in the 720s B.C. A century and a half later, the kingdom of Judah was conquered by the New Babylon in 587 B.C.E. and the Sacred Temple (Batual Maqdis, Al-Aqsha Mosque), which was the center of the Children of Israel. Many of the Israelites were then exiled to Babylon. These are the verses of the Book and of wisdom which We have sent down to you (O dear Prophet Mohammed - peace and blessings be upon him). After 50 years in exile, the Children of Israel were allowed to return to Palestine and rebuild the temple. Between the year 332-160 BC, the Palestinian region was ruled by Greek dynasties. They encouraged the process of Hellenization in its subsociety, making Greek culture very dominant in Palestine and Bani Israil's social-religious life. This process of Hellenization prompted the Jews to launch Maccabee rebellion and the Jews to rule independently under the leadership of the Hashmonayim Jewish Dynasty. While expanding its territory, Hashmonayim also forced the subjugated people to submit to the Jewish religion, although its inhabitants were not the children of Israel.",

These waves cross, and they move through the air, and they may also travel through a vacuum of space, since they do not need a transport medium (like an air molecule). The radio can now be heard through smart phones, as it was before the 20th century, when the wireless concept was still considered a mere fiction. Radio history is the history of technology that produces radio equipment that uses radio waves. The earliest radio station uses radiotelegraphy systems and does not carry audio. For audio broadcasts to be made possible, electronic detection devices and amplifications must be used. The history of radio discovery begins in Britain and the United States. Donald Mc. Nicol in his book Radio\u25aas Conquest of Space states that the defeat of space by radio began in 1802 by Dane, with the discovery of a message at short range using a simple device of electric wire. The next discovery was by three young scholars, among whom James Maxwell was British in 1865. He has been called the scientific father of wireless, for he has been able to find formulas that are thought to manifest electromagnetic waves, which are the waves used by radio and television. In 1896 Italian scientists, Guglielmo Marconi received a patent on a wireless telegraph that uses two circuits. At that time this signal could only be sent at close range. But this is what started the development of radio technology. In 1897, Marconi again published the discovery that wireless signals could be transmitted at a further distance (12 miles (19,000 m)). Next, in 1899 Marconi managed to communicate wirelessly between France and England through the English Channel using Tesla's oscillator.",

Two years later, Dr. Lee De Forest discovered an electron tube made up of three elements. This discovery allows sound waves to be transmitted via wireless communication systems. But the signal captured is still very weak. It wasn't until 1912 that Edwin Howard Armstrong discovered radio wave boosters called also amplifier radios. It works by picking up electromagnetic signals from radio transmissions and signaling back from the tube. That way signal strength will increase by 20,000 times per second. The voice caught is also so much stronger that it can be heard directly without the use of earphones. This discovery then became very important in the radio communication system because it was much more efficient than it used to be. Nevertheless, the patent on the amplifier falls into the hands of Dr. Lee De Forest. The use of radio as a tool or media mass communication was originally introduced by David Sarnoff in 1915. Next Le De Forrest through his radio broadcast experiment, which had broadcast a 1916 presidential campaign, so he was known as a pioneer radio broadcast. At first the signal on radio broadcast was transmitted through a continuous data wave both through amplitude modulation (AM), as well as frequency modulation (FM). This kind of signal delivery method is called analog. Next, as technology develops the Internet, and digital signals change the way radio signals are transmitted. The radio was originally used in maritime need to transmit a telegraph message using Morse code between the ship and the recipient on land. One of the early users of this technology was the Japanese Navy who were spying on the Russian fleet during the Tsushima War in 1901.",

Paleography is dominated by the Gondwana supercontinent in the south, the Siberian continent in the north, and the early formation of the Eurameric supercontinent in the middle. Devon's period is formally divided into three, which are Devon's Early, Middle, and End. The layers of rock that correspond to that time are referred to as the bottom, the center, and the top of the Devon system. Devon began from 416 million years ago to 397.5 to 20 million years ago and began with the Lochkovium sub 416 million years ago to 411.2 to 20 million years ago followed by Pragium from 411.2 million years ago to 407 to 20 million years ago later followed by Emsium, which took place until the time of Central Devon 397.5c.7 million years ago. At that time, the first ammonoid appeared, which was a descendant of the Bactritoid. Ammonoids at this time are simple in shape and are slightly different from a type of neutyloid. Ammonoidea was a superfamili of the Agoniatide order, which later evolved into a new Ammonoid order, such as Goniathida and Clymenida. This class of cephalopods dominated marine fauna until the early Mesozoic Era. Central Devon was divided into two: first there was Eifelium subs, then followed by Givetium 391.8c. 2.7 million years ago.

During the Devon period, some 365 million years ago, fish first evolved and had legs and began walking on land as tetrapods. The first seed - bearing plants spread across dry land and formed vast forests. The primitive shark thrives on late periods of Silang and Ordovium. Sprinkled fish (lobe-finded, Sarcopterygii), boned fish (bony fish, Osteichthyes) and molluscs like the amonite appear for the first time. Trilobites, brachiopods are like molluscs, and large coral reefs are also common. Mass extinction at the end of the period greatly affected marine life.

Kertawarma was angry and said, \"You're also ruthless, killing unarmed Buris swamps, who are leaving the field to restore power.\" After making fun of each other, they had a big fight. Satyaki took the sword and cut off Kertawarma's head in front of Kresna. Seeing that, the Wresni got angry and attacked Satyaki. Rukmini's son became fierce, then helped Satyaki.

This system was designed based on the TransMilenio system in Bogota, Colombia. Transjakarta was designed as a mode of mass transportation supporting the activities of a very dense capital. Transjakarta is the world's longest track BRT system (230.9 km), and it has 243 stops scattered in 13 main corridors (rute), which originally operates from 0500:00,000 WIB, and now operates 24 hours throughout its corridor. Transjakarta operated by Jakarta Transport PT. The amount of labor involved in the Transjakarta operations (Pramudi, bus officer, bus officer, bus officer, and janitor) are some 6,000. The average daily number of Transjakarta users is predicted by some 350,000 people. In 2012, however, the number of Transjakarta users reached 109,983,609 people. In 2011, this system reached its annual performance by bus carrying 114.7 million passengers and then in the following years it dropped and in 2014, the bus carried 111.6 million passengers, while in 2015 it served 102.95 million passengers. In 2016 a new record of 123.73 million passengers was reached. The cost is still Rp3,500 per passenger from the start. The idea of building a Bus Rapid Transit project in Jakarta appeared about 2001. Then this idea was followed by the governor of DKI Jakarta at the time, Sutiyoso. An institute called the Institute for Transportation & Development Policy (ITDP) became an important part of the project's planning process. The original concept was made by PT Pamintori Copyright, a transport consultant who has often worked with the Jakarta DKI Interconnection Service. In addition to the private parties, there are other parties who also support the success of the project, among which are the American aid agencies (USAID) and The University of Indonesia the Center for Transportation Studies (UI-CTS).",

In order for this socialization and introduction of mass transportation to the public, the first two weeks of operation (January 15 to 30, 2004) were not charged with transjakarta users. Starting February 1, 2004, transjakarta rates began for Rp2000. In 2012, the Jakarta DKI Interconnection Service decided to raise Transjakarta rates for Rp3500. Some post-esmising development of Corridor 1 continues to be carried out, including the opening of bus drivers for women, the repair of bus and stops, the treatment of women special zones, the placement of officers on buses, the sterilization of transjakarta routes with both manual and automatic portals, a test of contra-flow systems (transjakarta paths that are in the opposite direction of common traffic), and the services of disabled users with the name \"Transkarta Cares\". After Corridor 1 was successfully operated, the corridors next began to be constructed and inaugurated gradually: Transjakarta support transport continued to be attempted. The bus trail (feeder busway) was also operated in 2011 in three areas, which is SCBD, Garden of Developing, and Brother Land, but it was closed in December 2012 because operators thought the routes were deserted by users and caused losses.

Diseases are also known as medical conditions associated with certain clinical symptoms and signs. A disease can be caused by external factors like pathogens or by internal dysfunctions. For example, internal dysfunction of the immune system can produce different diseases, including various forms of immune deficiencies, hypersensitivity, allergies, and autoimmune diseases. In humans, disease is often used broaderly to refer to any condition that causes pain, dysfunction, stress, social problems, or death for sufferers, or similar problems for those associated with the person. In this broader sense, disease sometimes also includes injury, disabilities, disorders, syndrome, infections, isolated symptoms, aberrant behavior, and a typical variation of structure and function (unconventional), while in other contexts and for other purposes, these are categorized differently. Sickness affects not only a person physically but also mentally, since having and living with a disease can change a person's outlook on life. Death by disease is called death by natural causes. There are various ways to classify diseases, such as groups of infections, deficiencies, and genetic diseases. Diseases can also be divided into infectious diseases and not contagious. One of the most widely used grouping systems is the International Disease Classification (ICD) run by the World Health Organization (WHO). The disease that resulted most in human death in 2019 was coronary heart disease, followed by chronic strokes and destructive lung disease. The study of disease is called pathology.",

In many cases, such terms as sickness, disease, disorder, disorder, and morbidity are used in shifts; however, there are situations when certain terms are considered more appropriate. In infectious diseases, the incubation period is a period of time between infections and symptoms. The latency period is a period of time between infection and the ability of disease agents to spread to others, which can precede, follow, or simultaneously show symptoms. Some viruses also show the dorman phase, which is called the latency of the virus, which is when the virus hides inside the body in a state of inactivity. For example, the varicella-zoster virus that causes the chicken pox in the acute phase; after recovering from the chicken pox, the virus can remain in the nerve cells for many years, and then cause zoster herpes. Disease can be classified by cause, pathogenesis (mechanism of disease), or it is based on symptoms. Classification is also done according to the organ system involved, although this grouping is more complex because there are many diseases affecting more than one organ. The main challenge in nosology of disease is that it is often undefined and classified clearly, especially when its causes or pathogens are unknown. Hence, diagnosis sometimes only reflects symptoms or a series of symptoms (syndromics). Classically, the classification of human diseases is done based on observation of correlation between pathological analysis and clinical syndrome. At present, classification tends to be done based on the cause of its being known. The most familiar and widely used disease classification is the ICD published by the World Health Organization. This classification system is periodically updated with the latest publication which is ICD-11.

These bacteria include homofermentive (only resulting in lactic acid) and cannot use pentose (the C5 compound carboid). Optimum temperature for Pediooccus growth is 25-30 \u00b0C and pH optimum c. 6. The species and the strain of this genus differ in its tolerance or resilience to oxygen, pH, temperature, antibiotic resistance, and NaCl. Some strains of Pediooccus have been known to have one or more plasmids in various sizes, some of which encode genes for carbohydrate fermentation and bacterial production. Meat and processed products are home to some pedicoccus strains, such as sausage and ham. As it grows on meat, the Pediooccus can produce diasetils that act as antimicrobials, but can also eliminate the taste of food even in small amounts. Genus Pediooccus is involved in much of the fermentation of the plant, among which are P. acidilactii, P. dextrinicus, P. inopinatus, P. parvulus, and P. pentosaceus. Examples of the product of fermentation are sauerkraut, cereal porridge, cucumbers, olives, and fermentation beans. In addition, Pedicoccus was involved in fermentation of traditional foods in the world, such as the yeast for tapai (Indonesia), the hussuwa - the fermentation of soorgum (Sudan), Togwa (Tanzania), etc. Since 1985, it has been studied that the abilities of Pediooccus spp.",

Ahmadiyah's followers thought that Ahmad who would appear as Mahdi who according to their interpretation of the Quran and Hadith would have such qualities would bring back Islam and guide his followers with a moral system that would bring lasting peace. Ahmadi, therefore, viewed this Ahmadiyah movement as a resurrection movement in Islam.

Just like everyone else, intersex people can be appointed and raised as women or men but then identify themselves with different genders than the designated ones. Intersex people used to be called using hermaphrodites or congenital eunuchs. Another term that was also used among them was the true hermaphroditism and the male pseudophroditism used in early attempts in intersex terms. These terms are no longer used to call intersex conditions, especially for \"hermafrodit,\" because they're considered inappropriate and they make a stigma. Hermaphrodite is a term for animals and plants with individual male and female reproductive organs at the same time. In 1917, Richard Goldschmidt, a U.S. geneticist, used the term \"intersexuality\" to describe some sex offenders. Psychologist and sexologist Kenneth J. Zucker used that term in his works and \"intersexuality\" became a term that was likely to be used to refer to multiple sex differentiation syndromes. Meanwhile, the term \"intersex\" is debated because it does not distinguish diagnosis based on gender. In 2006, the term \"sex developmentist\" (disorders of sex development, DSD) was referred to as a substitute for \"intersex\" to describe physical sex haphazards. The DSD is determined by congenital conditions (born nature) in unusual chromosomal, genital glands, or gender anatomy.

Cracking generates a mix of products, and butena is extracted by distillation of fractions. Butena can be used as a monomer for polybutene but this polymer is more expensive than a polypropilene with shorter carbon chains. Polybutena is then commonly used as a commolymer, as in high temperatures as well as after reactions. Among the molecules with the chemical formula C4H8, the four isomers are alkena.

Guitars form on a central part of the body with a solid neck as where the strings generally number six are nestled. Guitars are traditionally shaped from different types of wood with strings made of nylon and steel. Some modern guitars are made of polycarbonate material. Generally speaking, guitars are divided into two types: acoustics and electricity. The acoustic guitar, with its hollow body, has been used for thousands of years. There are three major types of modern acoustic guitar: acoustic guitar strings, acoustic guitar strings, and an archtop guitar. Classic guitars are commonly played as solo instruments using comprehensive fingerpicking techniques. Electric guitars, introduced in the 1930s, depend on boosters that electronically manipulate guitar sounds. At the beginning of its use, electric guitars use a hollow body, but then the use of solid bodies is more appropriate. Electric guitars are widely known as major instruments on musical genres such as blues, country, reggae, jazz, metal, rock, and various forms of pop music. The English word \u0567gitar or guitar, originally derived from the name of the ancient pick instruments in the Persian region in about 1500 B.C.E., which was known as aur or a sehtar.

Nevertheless, al ud was taken to Western European countries and rivaled the popularity of vihuela in Spain. In Europe al ud was well received and developed into various European lute models until about the end of the 17th century. Meanwhile, vihuela grew to be a wide range of guitars for centuries until it finally became the classic guitar used at this point. The authenticity of the guitar cannot be seen by its authenticity. Some experts feel that it comes from the African continent, where many modern replicas of a shelllike round box with the Gut / thread of silk, in many of the continents. Another expert discovered this device in glass in the old stone relief reliefs in the days of Central Asia and ancient Asia. Other thought materials also arose with the discovery of a concave, ancient Greek vase. The Greek Strings may be the first tool categorized as a guitar. Modern guitars may be rooted in Spanish guitars, but guitars are like instruments of instruments that we can see in paintings in the Medieval and Renaiassance times that were abundant throughout Europe. Roughly the type of guitar can be divided over acoustic guitars and electric guitars. Acoustic guitars have hollow body parts and can produce relatively loud sounds without electrical amplification.

No large medical organization recommends universal postnatal circumcision and no one calls for bans. The Royal Dutch Medical Association, which presents some of the strongest opposition to postnatal circumcision practices, argues that even if there is good reason to ban it, doing so can also lead parents who insist on performing the surgery to turn to an unskilled practitioner rather than to a medical worker. An argument that keeps this operation within the scope of medical professionals is found in all major medical organizations. In addition, these organizations advise medical professionals to give parents some choices, which are largely based on religious or cultural views, in their decision to circumcise.

Eter is very common in organic and biochemical chemistry, because it's a linking group on carbohydrate compounds and lignin. Eter has a C-O-C bond around 110\u00b0 and the distance of C-O is approximately 140 pm. C-O bond rotation is very low. According to valence bond theory, oxygen hybridization in the ether compound is sp3. Oxygen is more electronegative than carbon, so hydrogens that are in alpha positions relative to ether are more acidic than hydrogen hydrocarbon compounds. Nevertheless, this hydrogen is less acid than the alpha hydrogen keton. Ether is not to be likened to the following groups that have a similar structure - R-O-R. The ether molecules cannot bind hydrogen to their fellow man, so that the ether compound has a relatively low boiling point compared with alcohol. Eter is slightly polarized because the angle of the C-O-C ether bind is 110 degrees, so the C-O pattern cannot eliminate each other. Eter is more polar than alkena, but it is not as polar as alcohol, ester, or amida. Nevertheless, the existence of two pairs of electrons alone on the atom of oxygen ether, allowing the ether to bond hydrogens with water molecules.Eter can be perfectly separated through destilation. Etercyclic is like tetrahydrofuran and 1.4-dioksana is sore in water because its oxygen atoms are more exposed to hydrogen bonds than other ether-alifatics. Eter generally has low chemical reactivity, although it is more reactive than alkana. Some examples of ether's important reaction are as follows.

An angle in the substitution, some ether can be split using different kinds of reagens like solid bases. Primary and secondary ether with the CH group next to the oxygen ether, can form peroxide, such as dietyl ether peroxide. This reaction requires oxygen (or udaara), and is accelerated by light, metal catalysts, and aldehida. The resulting peroxide can explode. Hence, it is rarely used as a solvent. Eter can play both Lewis bases and Bronsted bases. Strong acid can protonate oxygen, resulting in ion conium. For example, dietyl ether can form a complex with boron trifluoride, dietil eterat (BF3.OEt2). Eter also co-oriented with Mg otherl) in reagen Grignid. Polieter (e.g. ether mahoya) can bind metal very strongly.

This reaction is catalyzed by acid, usually sulfuric acid. This method is effective in producing ether symmetrical ether, but it cannot be used to produce asymmetrical ether. Dietil ether is produced from ethanol using this method. Eter cyclic can also be produced by using this method. Eter can also be made through the nucleithofyl halide substitution by this reaction alxide called etheric synthesis Williamson.

Throughout its history, the role of caliphs and forms of caliphs have had a wide variety of features that were deeply influenced by the political and religious conditions of the day.

The caliph function as head of the state vanished as the fall of Baghdad by the Mongols in 1258. The rest of the Abbasids continued in Egypt under Mamluk's empire. Without adequate power and political power, the caliphs only act as symbolically united Muslims so that the caliphs of this period are known as \"the caliphs of the shadows.\" After the Sultanate Mamluk was conquered by the Sultanate of Utsmani in 1517, the Utsmani leader took up the Caliph for themselves. The degree of caliph is limited only as a symbolic leader of the Islamic world after 1258 and it remains unchanged in the days of Utsmani. The rulers of Utsmani are in power because of their position as sultans and ricesar (katansar), not because of their standing as caliphs. The practice of Utsmani rulers is very rarely used their caliphs in internal and foreign politics and uses their status more frequently as sultans and ricesh (head of Utsmani state). The Caliph began to be used by the ruler of Utsmani at the time of the treaty K\u00fc\u00e7k Kaynarca, to assert his position as protector of the Islamic people in Russia.

The only Oregon national park, Crater Lake National Park, consists of calderas surrounding Crater Lake and the deepest lake in the United States. The state of Oregon is also home to the largest single organism in the world, Armillaria ostoyae, a fungus that grows under 2,200 acres [2,200 ha] (8.9 km2) in Malheur National Forest. Because of its diverse landscapes and waterways, the Oregon economy is largely powered by various forms of agriculture, fisheries, and hydroelectricity. Oregon is also the top lumber producer in the United States, with the wood industry dominating the state economy during the 20th century. Technology is one of Oregon's main economic forces, beginning in the 1970s with the establishment of Silicon Forest and the expansion of Techtronix and Intel. The Nike Sports Company, Inc., headquarters in Beaverton, is the largest public enterprise in the state of Oregon with an annual income of $30.6 billion. The earliest evidence of the name Oregon came from Spanish. The term \"orej\u00f3n\" (meaning \"big ears\") comes from the history of Relaci\u00f3n de la Alta y Baja California (1598), written by Rodrigo Montezuma of New Spain; it refers to the Columbia River when Spanish explorers entered into the region of North America that became part of the Viceroy of New Spain.",

It basically contains the overall summary of the Mahabharata story, the stories of the story background, the ancestors of the Bharata family, to the youth of Korawa and Pandawa. The story is told in a frame story and the plot is leaping so it doesn't flow so well. The story of Bharata's extended family begins with a conversation between the Ugrasrawas who visited Sokka's clouds in the forest of Nemisa. These are verses of the Book of Al-Muttaqun (the pious - see V. 2:2). The Adiparwa is spoken of as a narrative. The contents of the book began when the Ugrasrawa came to the Sokka scholars who were performing ceremonies in the forest of Nemisa. The Ugrasrawa told Sokka the existence of a collection of books called Astadasaparwa, the story of Pandawa and Korawa, a descendant of the Bharata. From what the Ugrasrawa told us, the great Bharata family story (Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata) flows. As told, there is a king named Parikesit, the son of Abhimanyu, who sits on Hastinapura. He is a descendant of the Kuru, so he is also called Kuruwangsa. One day, he was hunting deer into the middle of the woods. He followed him until he lost track. In the woods he crossed paths with a priest named Samiti scholars. The King asked where the deer had gone, but the priest was silent. That angered King Parikesit. He took a dead snake, then threw it around the priest's neck. The priest's son Srenggi learned this from the Kresa explanation, and then he became angry. He cursed the King, so that he might die of being bitten by a snake, seven days after the curse was cast. After the King received the curse, he took refuge in a tower guarded and closely watched by his soldiers and his patters.",

King Janautiah ruled justly and wisely so that the world was at peace, every enemy he could conquer. When the King conquered the village of Taxila, the Uttkak came to the King and said his hate for the Taksaka Dragon was the cause of his father's death. The King studies the story and its patients justify the story of the Uttanang. The King is encouraged to perform a snake sacrifice ceremony to avenge the Taksaka Dragon. Long story short, he's got all the ceremony requirements and invites priests and hexists to help with the ceremony. Seeing the King perform the ceremony, the Takasaka Dragon becomes restless. Then he sent the Astika to thwart the King's ceremony. The acetika received the assignment and then went to the ceremony site. The Astika worshipped the king and begged him to cancel the ceremony. The King, having mercy on the Astics, called off the ceremony. Finally, the Attic begs to return to Nagaloka. Even the Taksaka Dragon survived the ceremony.

There are no elements that don't pair up or have more than one pair. In mathematical terms, the function of bijective f: X \u2192 Y is a one-to-one (injection) and onto (surjective) from set X to set Y. The term one-to-one correspondence cannot be confused with one-to-one function (injection function). A bijection from assembly X to assembly Y has an invers function from Y to X. If X and Y are set up, then the existence of a bijection means that both groups have the same number of elements. For an endless assembly, it's used the concept of a cardinal number of ways to distinguish the sizes of an endless assembly. The bijactive function of a assembly to itself is called permutation and assembly of all permutations of a group forming a symmetrical group. Bijactive functions are essential in various fields of mathematics including the definition of isomorphism, homeomorphism, difeomorphism, permutative groups, and projective maps. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise. A function that meets the nature of the number (3) is said to be \"onto Y\" or is called a surjection (or surjective function).

This symbol is a combination of the symbol of the arrow to the right, which is used to represent the surjection and arrow to the tailed right that is used to symbolize injection.

The two assemblys were then paired to determine the order of the player's position in the game.

About 1150, a massive flood ended the development of the settlement area, which then led to the construction of the protective dikes and dams, including the Schielands Hoge Zeedijk ('The High Sea') along the northern edge of what is now called Nieuweas (\"New Meuse\").

The demands of roles are related to the pressures given to a person as a function of certain roles he plays in the organization. Conflicts in role create expectations that may be difficult to resolve or satisfy. Personal demands are pressures created by employees. Lack of support from colleagues and bad personal relationships can cause stress, especially among high - social needs. Personal factors consist of family problems, personal economic problems, as well as personality and character attached to one's person. National surveys consistently show that people are deeply concerned about family and personal relationships. The various difficulties in marriage life, the breakdown of relationships, and the difficulties in discipline problems with children are some examples of relationships that create stress. Economic problems because the larger life patterns of pegs than poles are other personal obstacles that create stress for employees and disrupt the concentration of employees.

This empire implements bureaucratic administration centered under the leadership of Caesar and has a great professional military force and conscription forces, inspiring similar developments in other empires in the future. According to traditional views, the vast region of the empire of Achaimenia and its extraordinary ethnocultural diversity eventually became a loss because of the surrender of power to local authorities eventually weakened the king's central authority, leaving much of its energy and resources wasted as a result of having to stop the local uprising. This explains why when Alexander the Great (Alexander III of Macedonia) invaded Persia in 334 B.C.E. he faced an empire divided by weak leaders, easily to be destroyed. This viewpoint was opposed by some modern historians who argued that the Achaimenia Empire did not suffer such a crisis in the days of Alexander, and that only the confusion of internal power change took place within the Akhemenid family ever nearly weakened the empire. Alexander, who was an admirer of Cyrus the Great, eventually led to the collapse and disintegration of the empire around 330 B.C.E., making it part of the Ptolemaic Empire and the Seleucia Empire, besides other small areas that cut themselves up in those days.

And when he grew up, he brought it to Pharaoh's daughter, who made her his son, and named him Moses. When the Israelites survived across the Red Sea and Pharaoh's army were drowned in the sea, Moses led the people with a victory song. Then said Miryam the prophet, Aaron's sister, take thee a tibana in his hand, and all the women that were with him shall go down after him, and shall go down after him, and shall dance with him. And Miriam said unto them, Sing unto the LORD; for he is high: for he hath cast his horse and his rider into the sea. Flavius Josephus' historian \"Antiquities of the Jews\" states that Miriam was the wife of Hur, referred to in the book of Exodus as Moses ' closest companion. However, Targum is about the 1st Book of Chronicles. 19, iv. 4, records Miriam as Hur's mother, indicating that the Euphrates, Caleb's wife, was another name for Miriam. On the way to the land of Canaan, the Israelites, all the people, to the wilderness of Zin, in the first month, lived the people in Kandash. Miriam died and was buried there. According to the water symbol associated with Miriam, after her death, God provided the Israelites with an abundance of springs of water, the waters of Meribah, unfortunately, after their quarreling with God and causing Moses and Aaron to sin, so that they could not enter the land of Canaan.",

To date known as 264 kinds of monkeys live in the world. Unlike monkeys, monkeys are usually tailed and smaller in size. Monkeys are known to learn and use tools to help them with food. The grouping of monkeys is parafiletic, since Old World monkeys (Cercopithecoidea) are actually closer to genetic kinship with apes (Hominidae) than New World monkeys (Platyrrini). The biggest monkey is the mandrill. Some monkeys in everyday language are also often referred to as apes. Some monkeys have used human beings as animals of age or animals to help with everyday work. The long - tailed monkey (Maca fascicularis) is the most common animal to interact with humans and is often kept as a stray animal, a circus animal, or laboratory experiment. He's also the first primate to ever go to space. Carves were maintained in some places in Sumatra and Malaya to be trained as coconut pickers. Monkeys in the forest of Mt. Bunder move trees during the day, jumping from one branch to the other and standing still when mountaineers pass by. Maybe that's where the monkey lives next to the root tiger and the snake. In West Sumatra, to be precise with Maninjau Lake, an inn next to it was built with forests and monkeys could easily climb trees and enter the terrace of a hotel near the swimming pool. On the way up and down to Maninjai Lake, monkeys roam freely and like waiting for food thrown by travelers. You're in the middle of a hot shower. Carves are trained to be coconut pickers in Sumatra.

Another study revealed the history of dog domestication not so long ago. Dogs have evolved into hundreds of different races. The color of the dog's hair can be diverse, from white to black, also red, gray (frequently called \"blue\"), and brown. In addition, dogs have different kinds of hair. The hair of the dog can be straight or curly, and it has a rough texture that is as soft as wool. The science that learned everything about dogs is called kinology (from the ancient Greek \u25aa\u03c5t\u03c5\u03bde, read kyn New evidence reveals dogs were first tamed in East Asia, probably China. The first human to set foot in North America brought with them dogs from Asia. Genetic studies have identified 14 ancient breeds of dogs, including Chow Chow, Sharpei, Akita, Shiba and Basenji who are the oldest breeds of dogs. A theory that says dogs come from Asia may be reliable because most of the 14 ancient breeds of dogs are from China and Japan. Dogs are as social as humans are. The closeness of dog - to - human behavior allows dogs to be trained, invited to play, to live with humans, and to be associated with humans and other dogs. Dogs have a unique position in interspecies relationships. The loyalty and devotion shown by dogs are very similar to the human concept of love and friendship. Despite its natural instinct as a group animal, the owner of the dog greatly appreciates the loyalty and devotion of the dog and considers it a member of his own family.",

The dog distinguishes little from the owner's position with the dog's partner who is still one group, and often even does not tell the difference at all. In fact, when a band of criminals surrendered, the sheepdog who had previously barked at the officers joined in giving in by lying back at his master's side while showing his stomach, this was considered a sign of surrender, for his soft stomach was not protected, but it was shown. The term dog refers to the wolf's domesticated canis lupus familiarist. Dogs were once classified as speciesies different from wolves, Canis familiarists, by Linnaeus in 1758. In 1993, the Smithsonian Society and the Association of American Mammal Experts established dogs as the subspecies of the gray wolf Canis lupus. In Indonesia, the native forest dogs of Sumatra and Java are called coeds. Dogs are considered to have considerable intelligence according to scientific research and field evidence. The level of dog intelligence depends on race and individual dogs. Border Collie's famous dogs can obey and carry out various commands. Other race dogs may not be interested in obeying human commands, but prefer to show intelligence in other matters such as grazing livestock. The origin of dogs as descendants of wolves who live in packs makes dogs easier to train than any other animal. As a member of the group, dogs have an instinct to obey. Most dogs don't often have to deal with complicated tasks, so there's no chance of learning difficult things like opening doors without human help.
