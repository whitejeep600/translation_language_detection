According to the Book of Ezra in the Hebrew Bible and the Old Testament in the Christian Bible, he returned from Babylon with the exiles, covering the priests and the Levites to teach the law in Jerusalem (Ezra 7-10 and Nehemiah 8). That was during the reign of Artaxerxes, the Persian king of 458 B.C.E. According to 1 Esdras, a Greek translation of the book of Ezra still in use in the Eastern Orthodox Church, he was also a Jewish High Priest. While Rabinik's tradition held that he was just an ordinary priest. His name may be abbreviated to Hebrew: Azariahhu, \"God helps.\" In the Greek Septuagint, his name was written \u00c9sdr\u0101s, which is the origin of the Latin name Esdras. He is believed to have written the book of Ezra, who recorded the return of many bands of the Jews from the captivity of Babylon, to Jerusalem (Ezra 8:2-14), where he taught the people to observe the law, and to purify themselves from the Gentiles.\" Ezra was a Levite and a descendant of High Priest Aaron. The prologue: Early Christian writers sometimes quoted Ezra as the author of the apocalyptic books associated with him. Clement of Alexandria in Stromata called Ezra an example of prophetic inspiration, quoting a part of 2 Esdras. In Islamic religion Ezra is known as Uzayr (Arabic language), referred to in the Quran. Although not recorded as one of the Islamic Prophets, considered to be a prophet by a number of Muslim scholars based on tradition.",

        "paragraph": "Gender or jetina are a series of characteristics that are bound to and distinguish masculinity and feminineity. That characteristic can include gender (male, female, or intersexual), which is defined by gender (social structure as gender), or gender identity. People who don't identify themselves as men or women are generally grouped into nonbiner societies or genderqueers. Some cultures have a specific gender role that differs from \"man\" and \"woman\" collectively referred to as a third gender such as the Bissu in Bugis society in Sulawesi and the Hijra in South Asia. New Zealand's sexologist John Money raised a difference in the use of biological gender and gender as a role in 1955. Before that, the word \"gender\" was rarely used to mention anything other than grammatical gender in language science. Money's definition was not immediately recognized long before the late 1970s when feminist theory raised the concept of the difference between biological gender and gender as social construction. The definition is still used in such contexts as in social science and in some documents published by the World Health Organization. Other contexts use the term \"gender\" that includes or instead of \"sex.\" For example, in a study of nonhuman animals, gender is commonly used to call the gender of animals. The change in meaning from the word \"gender\" can be traced back to the 1980s. In 1993, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) began using gender as a substitute for gender terms (English: sex). Then in 2011, the FDA started using sex/sex for biological classification and gender to \"represent itself as a male or female or how it responds to social institutions based on one's gender presentation.\"",

Gender studies generally discuss gender as a social construct while science in nature deals with biological differences between men and women that can affect the development of gender in humans. Both approaches contribute to examining how far biological differences affect the formation of gender identity in a person. The trickotomy between biological gender, psychological gender, and social gender first appeared in a journal article on transsexualism in 1978. The word gender comes from the French Middle gendre which originally was a hint derived from the Latin word genus meaning \"type\" or \"type\" The modern French word associated with genre (as in genre sexuel). Oxford English Dictionary of the first edition of 1900 mentions that the early meaning of gender as \"kind\" is not commonly used. The word gender is still widely used mainly in linguistics to call gender grammatical (gentlemen, feminine, and neutral). The academic significance of the word \"gender\" in the context of the social roles of men and women is more or less dated to 1945. The 1970s feminist movement then developed and popularized the word. The word gender is also widely used in place of the word sex or gender (as a biological category), although there are some who are trying to maintain differences between the two. American Heritage Dictionary (2000) uses the following two sentences to describe the differences between the two terms while stating that the differences between the two in principle are useful but not used widely and have variations in various contexts.",

Venice has a similar barrier, but it is no longer capable of handling high tides; the new dike system is under construction. The floods of London and Venice can be considered useless if sea level continues to rise.

Service is a standard non-traditional variable and is very varied. That is, because of the service of a work offering, there is no equal service for one person. This is because of human interactions with all the different expectations and perceptions that accompany those interactions.

Polyethylene is a polymer composed of long chains of ethylene monomer (IUPAC: etena). In the polymer industry, polyethylene was written with a shorthand of PE, the same treatment done by Politirena (PS) and Polipropilene (PP). Molecular etena C2H4 is CH2=CH2. Two CH2 groups united with a double bond. Polyethylene is formed through the polymerization process of ethena. Polietilena can be produced through the process of radical polymerization, anionic addition, polymerization ion coordination, or polymerization of the Cationic addition. Each method produces a different type of polyethylene. Polietilena was first synthesized by a German chemist named Hans von Pechmann who did so by accident in 1898 while heating diazometana. When his colleagues, Eugen Bamberger and Friedrich Tschirner found out about the white substance, waxing, they learned that what he made contained a long chain -CH2- and named it polymethylene. The industrial synthesis of polyethylene was first performed, again, by Eric Fawcett and Reginald Gibson in 1933 at the ICI facility in Northwich, England. When treating a mixture of ethylene and benzaldide at very high pressure, they get the same substance that Pechmann got. The reaction was initialized by the existence of oxygen in the reaction so it was difficult to reproduce at the time. However, Michael Perrin, another ICI chemist, successfully synthesized it in 1935, and in 1939 the LDPE industry first began. Polietilena is made up of different kinds based on density and branching of molecules. The mechanical properties of polyethylene depend on the type of branching, crystal structure, and molecular weight.",

UHMWPE can be made with Catalyst technology, and Ziegler's catalyst is the most common. Because of its resistance to netization and dismemberment and chemicals, this type of plastic has a broad application. UHMWPE is used as an inderdill of a can and bottle machine, a moving part of a player engine, a gear, a connector, an outer side shield, an implant that replaces the waist and knee in surgery. HDPE is characterized by extra density or equals 0.941 g/cm3. HDPE has a low degree of branching and has very high molecular strength and tensil strength. HDPE can be produced with a chromium/silica catalyst, Ziegler-Natta, or a metallocane catalyst. HDPE is used as a milk bottle maker, a powder bottle, a margarine pack, a water pipe, and a trash can. PEX is a polyethylene with medium-to-high density that has cross-link connections to its polymer structure.

In this mass extinction, many groups are commonly known as non-unggas dinosaurs, Plesiosaurs and mosasaurus, as well as many other less - known groups, extinct. The causes of this extinction are most often associated with asteroids at a width of about 10 to 15 kilometers (6.2 to 9.3 miles) that collides with the Earth, ending the Chalk. Maastrichtium was introduced into the scientific literature by Belgian geologist Andr\u00e9 Hubert Dumont in 1849, after studying rock strata from the Kapur Group close to the Dutch city of Maastricht.

This Cendol as a traditional Indonesian beverage was originally made of hunkwe flour, but now cendol is made of rice flour, served with scar ice and liquid red sugar and coconut milk. This drink has a sweet and juicy flavor. In West Java it is known as cendol, whereas in Central Java it is known as es dawet, especially in Banjar county districts for its typical es dawet \"day\". A popular belief in Indonesian society that the term \"cendol\" may very well come from the word \"jendol\", which is found in Sundanese and Javanese, is referring to the sensations of idoliles that are felt when the bendol is used through the mouth to drink ice cendol. At the time of making cendols, rice flour is treated with green dyes and printed through special tools, resulting in the shape of grains. The dye used originally was a natural dye of pandant, but today it has been used for artificial food dyes. The cendol has broken through Malaysia's seams, which are made by sifting through rice flour that is dyed with suji leaves and resulting in the tasteful spherical shape of ovals at the end.

In Supplement op het Maleisch-Nederduitsch Woordenboek (1869) by Jan Pijnapel (Gz. ), Tjendol is described as a drink or a diluted pasta made of sagu, coconut, sugar and salt. Cendol came from the western part of the island of Java (Tana Sundan; now part of the province of West Java, Banten, and Jakarta province), while dawet belonged to part of the Javan region of Banjar. The other difference is that on the basis of the cendol ice, it used to be made of sagu arenn, rice flour, hunkwe. It was generally made by hunkwe and rice flour alone. It was then dyeed in green food or by suji leaf; but some wore pandants. Once it has the right color, it will be printed using a special tool. Generally, it's a long glass with a hole under it. From there the typical form of ovals from cendol comes. While dawet's base material used to be made of rice flour or sticky rice flour, it was painted with a green dye of suji leaves. The process makes it simpler than the marker. By the way dawet dough is printed using a simple filter. Adonan dawet is poured into a hollow sieve, and then it is shaken to make the dough fall.

In general, older brothers who hunt fish have longer, thicker beaks, than sisters who hunt prey on the ground. The largest and most typical beak is the kookaburra. They generally have short four - finger legs, three of which lead forward. Sisters have binocular vision and are specially thought to have good color vision. They limit the movement of their eyes inside the eye cavity, instead of using head movements to track prey. Moreover, they were able to compensate for water refraction and reflection while hunting prey underwater, and accurately assessing underwater depth. They also have nictitating membranes that cover their eyes to protect them when they hit the water. Sisters are scattered throughout the tropics and are in the world. They don't exist in the polar regions and some of the driest deserts in the world. A number of species have reached the island group, mainly in the south and east of the Pacific Ocean. Tropical and Australasia are central areas for this group. Europe and North America in northern Mexico are very rare, each one having only one kingfisher (common kingfisher and belf kingfisher).

        "paragraph": "Traditional groups: flowering plants, Angiosperma, or Anthhophyta (\"flower plants\") or Magnoliophyta (\"secret plants with magnolia\") are the largest group of plants that live on land. Its name is derived from its most distinctive feature, producing reproductive organs in the form of flowers. Flowers are actually modifications of leaves and stems to support a closed fertilization system. This closed fertilization system is another characteristic, so this group is also known as Angiospermae. The latter distinguishes them from other seed - bearing plant groups: open - grained plants (Gymnospermae). The name Angiospermae is derived from the merge of two ancient Greek words: \u25aaO\u03bd (aggeion, \"proper\" or \"protector\") and the spruce (sperma, plural form for \"biji\") introduced by Paul Hermann in 1690. In most modern taxonomy systems, this group now occupys taxon as division. However, APG II classification System and continued, the APG III classification system, which is based on APG version filogeny classification, flowering plants are placed in a clid that does not occupy a tax and is named Angiospermae. Montsechia vidalii, a water plant found in Spain, has been identified as the oldest flowering plant, which grew about 130 million years ago, with fossils from the Cretaceous period. In a review of more than 1,000 fossils, scientists have concluded that the plant has been able to produce simple fruit, a basic trait that defines angiosperma, and it is likely to produce male and female flowers in separate plants. In view of its habitat in the waters, this discovery indicates that water pollination may be more important in flower evolution than was previously predicted. The flowering plant is distinguished from other groups based on apomorphic traits typically developed by this group.",

        "paragraph": "Most of these traits are located in the reproductive part. Here's a description: a flower becomes the most vivid of all and distinguishes it from other seed-based plants. Flowers help this group of plants to expand its ecological evolutionary and lunar abilities to make it very suitable for life on land. Stamen or stamen are much lighter than organs with similar functions on open seed plants (which are strobilus). The stamen has evolved to adapt to pollinators and to prevent its own conception. The adaptation in this direction also extends the scope of his living space. The most induced male gametophyth (in pollen and only three cells) has helped to reduce time between pollination, when pollen reaches the female's organs, and fertilization. Normal intervals between these two stages are usually 12 - 24 hours. At Gymnospermae the time it takes for it can reach a year. Carpella or close fruit leaves wrap up a potential seed or ovulum, thus preventing unwanted conception. The sperm cells will be controlled by the injection to fertilize the egg (ovum) cells. After conception, carpella and some surrounding tissue will also develop into fruit. The fruit is adaptive by protecting the seeds from unwanted threats and helping the process of spreading to larger areas. As in the male gametophyth, the size of the female gametophyth is also greatly reduced to just seven cells and is protected in the future of seeds. This dwindling size helps to accelerate the development of plants. Only the Angiospermae group has a season of behavior in the process of their lives. This behavior makes it very easy to explore the vastr lunauts. The formation of endosperma on a seed is typical of Angiospermae that strongly supports adaptation because it complements embryos or sprouts with food reserves in its development.",

The case was discovered in several newts. It's called a neotoni. In everyday languages, the shape of the larvae is known in various names.

His other work revolved around everyday life in Rome, politics, oratories and life history of a number of writers, including literature, historian and interpreter. Suetonius was a close friend of Pliny the Younger, a senator and author of historical letters. Pliny described it as \"a silent and diligent study, a dedicated writer.\" Pliny helped him buy a piece of land in the Roman province of Italy and asked Emperor Trajan to grant the right to Suetonius as was commonly given to a father with three children (us trium liberorum), since Suetonius had no children. Through Pliny, Suetonius was known by Emperor Trajan and Hadrian. Under Trajan, he became a secretary for the study and director of Imperial archives. Under Hadrian, he became the Emperor's secretary. But in 119, Hadrian fired Suetonius for having an affair with Vibia Sabina.

Gendericides often resort to violence against women or men and this becomes a problem handled by human rights. Gendercide has something in common with the term 'genocide' in the case of mass murder. But the difference is, gendericides only target one sex, male or female. Genderside is reported to be a growing problem in some countries. The census statistics report that in countries like China and India, the ratio of men to women is 120 men to 100 women. Abortion because it dislikes the gender of a baby that's about to be born (usually for a girl) is a form of gendericide. The same is true of infant murder and deadly violence toward certain genders at every stage of life. The term gendericide was first created by the American feminist Mary Anne Warren in 1985 in her book Gendercide: The Implications of Sex Selection. It refers to the gender-specific mass murder. This refers to gender selective mass murder. Warren drew an analogy between \"conceptions of genocide\" and what he called \"gendersida.\" In his book, Warren wrote: With that analogy, gendericides will be a deliberate annihilation of people of certain genders. Another term, such as \"genocide\" and \"femica\", has been used to refer to the murder of wrong girls and women. But \"gendericide\" is a term for sex-neutral, because the victim may be male or female. It requires that kind of sex-neutral terms, because the sexual discriminating murders are the same when the victim becomes a male.

Some late sauropterygians, such as pliosauroidea, developed similar mechanisms in their mopvis. Which makes it unique to other reptiles, the sauropterygia moves its tail vertically like modern cetacea and syrenia. The earliest Sauroperygia appeared some 245 million years ago (Ma), at the beginning of the Trias period: the very first sauropterygia must have been the first with the right stratigraphic datum located in the Olenekian Olenekian division in South China. The early small example (about 60 cm), animals similar to semiacautic lizards with long legs (pachypleurosaurs), but they grow up to a few feet and spread to shallow waters (nothosaurs). The extinction of the Trias-Jura wiped them all out except the Plesiosauria. During the early Jura, these water reptiles were quickly diversified into the long-headed Plesiosauria of a small neck, and the pliosauria of a short-headed neck. In fact, people used to think that Plesiosaurs and pliosaurs were two different superfamily following separate evolutionary lines. Now it seems that this is merely a morphine because both kinds evolved several times, with some pliosauria evolved from the ancestors of Plesiosauria, and vice versa. The sauropterygia classification seems difficult. Acautic environmental requirements cause the same features to evolve several times among reptiles, an example of converging evolution. Sauroperygia is diapsida, and since the late 1900s, scientists have thought that they might be related to turtles.

The degree of caliph is limited only as a symbolic leader of the Islamic world after 1258 and it remains unchanged in the days of Utsmani.

Three different settlements have existed near that site for over 11,000 years (about 9000 B.C.), almost at the beginning of the Holocene era in the history of the world. That position is about the northern route of the Dead Sea. Jerome is described in the Hebrew Bible as \"The City of the Palem Tree. \" Many water sources inside and around this city attract people to inhabit them for thousands of years. Known in the Judeo-Kristen tradition as the place where the Battle of Jericho was fought that ensured Israel's settlement in the land of Canaan when it came out of Egypt, under the leadership of Joshua bin Nun, Moses ' successor. The Hebrew name Jericho, Jerome, is believed to be derived in the Canaanite language Reaur, because it was the center of the worship of the gods of the moon. The name Jericho in Arabic, \u25aaAr \u25aa\u0101, means \"funs\" and is derived from the same Canaanite word Rea Tirzah, with the same meaning as Hebrew.

In the Standard Model of particle physics, matter is not a basic concept because the basic constituent of atoms is a quantum entity that has no \"size\" or \"volume\" inherent in the sense of the word. Because of the principle of exception and other fundamental interactions, some \"particles of the dot\" are known as phermions, and many composites and atoms, effectively being forced to distance themselves from other particles in everyday conditions; it creates the properties of matter that appear to us as matter occupying space.",

So, in physics to this day, matter has no universal or no fundamentil concepts. Matter is also used freely as a common term for the substance that complements the non-observable physical matter. The everyday objects that are often encountered are made up of atoms. The atomic material is formed because of the interaction of subatomic particles the atomic nucleus of some protons and neutrons, as well as the cloud from the electron-electron edar line. Specifically, science considers the combination of these particles material because they have mass and volume silence. On the other hand, massless particles, such as photons, are not viewed as material because they have neither a silent mass nor a volume. After all, not every particle with a mass of silence has a classic volume, since such fundamental particles as quarts and leptons (sometimes compared to matter) are considered to be an ineffectual fraction of particles' size and volume. Even so, quartks and leptons set up \"regular matter,\" and their interactions contributed to the effective volume of the compound of the particles that make up \"usual matter.\" Matters composed of molecules and molecules are made up of atoms.

In other words, gasoline is made up of molecules consisting of only hydrogen and carbon bound between one and the other, forming chains. If gasoline is burned to ideal conditions with oxygen abundance, it will produce CO2, H2O, and heat energy. Every kilogram of gasoline contains 42.4 MJ. Gasoline is made from crude oil, a black liquid pumped from the earth's stomach and commonly called oil. This liquid contains hydrocarbons; the carbon atoms in this crude oil relate to one another by forming a different length of chain. The molecules of different lengths of hydrocarbons will have different properties as well. CH4 (methana) is the most \u25aaringan molecule; the increased C atoms in the chain will make it even more heavy. The first four molecules of hydrocarbons were methane, ethana, propane, and butane.

But a close associate named Justus von Liebig named Benzol, according to him, reminded him of Strychnin and Chinin's drug, which had nothing to do with it. Since then, Benzin's name has been used in German for an undetermined mixture of mild hydrocarbons, made of coal tar or oil, while Benzol (or \"pure benzin\") consists of benzenes. The word was then absorbed into Dutch and many other languages, including English. Because it's a mixture of different ingredients, gasoline fuel is different according to its composition. The size of this fuel can be seen from the number of octanes per mixture. The octane number is a measure of the fuel's ability to cope with a knock while burning in gasoline. The number 0 is set for the burnable n-heptana, and the value is 100 for non-burnable isookana. A mixture of 30 n-heptana and 70 isotakna will have octan numbers: The gas octan number can be determined through the burning test of gasoline samples to acquire the characteristics of the burning. These characteristics are then compared to the burning characteristics of various n-heptana and isookana mixtures. If there are matching characteristics, then the isotakna levels in the mixture of n-heptana and isookana are used to express the value of the octan number of the tested gasoline.",

In Singapore, tomans are kept in pools and fishing channels. The fish is favored by fishermen because of the strong rapture when it grabs bait at the tip of the hook. Young toman fish are beautifully colored and preferred as aquarium fish. Hence, it is often exported as an ornamental fish to the country, including the United States. These fish have been causing problems there lately. In 2002 and 2003, four tomans were found in the waters of Maryland and Wisconsin. Allegedly, these fish have been released or released from the aquarium. The presence of these fish has disturbed the authorities in the country because it is feared that they will breed, invade and disrupt the balance of natural communities in local waters. This concern has also begun to be felt in Indonesia, precisely on the jawa island. A lot of fishing communities or individuals who spread out in the waters of the jawa island for conservation reasons or as a hobby for fishing. This is, of course, very alarming, considering that a very aggressive predator is concerned about disrupting the biodiversity on the jawa island, because it's not native fish in Java.",

It can be produced in various forms like sheets and 3D forms, the polyester as thermoplasmic can change form once heated. Although flammable at high temperatures, polyesters tend to wrinkle away from fire and extinguish themselves when burning. The polyester fiber has high strength and E-modulus and low water absorption and minimal wrinkles compared with other industrial fibers. Polyester cloths are woven in consumer clothing and such household furnishings as bed sheets, bed coverings, curtains and curtains. Industrial polyester is used in tire ironing, ropes, fabrics for delivery belt (conveyor), seat belts, coated cloths and plastic amplifications with high levels of energy absorption. Fiber fills of polyester are also used to fill pillows and blanket warmers. The polyester fabric is called a natural taste of \u25efnot in comparison with the same woven fabric of natural fibers (e. g. cotton in textile use). But polyester cloths have some advantages such as the increase in endurance of wrinkles. As a result, polyester fibers are sometimes spun together with natural fibers to produce clothes with combined properties. Polyesters are also used to make bottles, movies, tarpaulins, canoes, liquid crystals, holograms, filters, brooms (filts) electrically for condensation, defibrillators for wires and fuses.

The hydrogen attached to this carbon is called hydrogen-like. With the existence of catholic acid, ketons experience keto-enol tautomerism. A strong base reaction produces a follicle. In general, ketons are named after the IUPAC layout by replacing the sufis -a in the parent alkana with -on.

And when he had made an end of hiding it, he laid it in the midst of the river, and put it in the middle of the river, and Miriam, the sister of Moses, to see what was its end. And Pharaoh's daughter came to take her bath in the river, and her ladies walked by the river, and she saw the ark which was in the midst of her. And when he opened it, he saw it, and, behold, the child wept, so that he had compassion on him, and said: Surely this is a Hebrew baby.",

The majority of the people are Inuit. Their ancestors moved from Canada in the 13th century and slowly spread throughout the island. Greenland is the largest island in the world (Australia and Antarctica, equally larger than Greenland, commonly considered continent). Three fourths of Greenland is covered by the only eternal ice plate other than Antarctica. With a population of 56,480 (2013), Greenland is the world's most populated area. About a third of the population lived in Nuuk, the capital and the largest city. The Arctic Umiaq Line ferry connects cities and settlements to major transportation in western Greenland. Greenland was seasonalally inhabited for the past 4,500 years or so by Arctic tribes whose ancestors came from Canada. The Vikings began to settle in southern Greenland in the 10th century after previously inhabiting Iceland to avoid persession of the Norwegian King and his rule. They later sailed from Greenland and Iceland to the Americas. Leif Erikson became a European on record for the first time in North America, nearly 500 years before Columbus landed on the Caribbean.

Three key compounds that bring about chalk are calcium carbonate, calcium oxide, and calcium hydroxide (that dominates dead chalk). Chalks found in nature can also be mixed with magnesium minerals. Such chalks are called dolomits. In many instances, the formation of chalk occurs in the sea, when ancient marine organisms that have calcium shells die and remains (the shell or outer skeleton) pile up and slowly form a layer of silt. After millions of years, these layers become rocks through the geological process. Chalk is a very useful material in various human activities and is relatively inexpensive. Most utilization is in the fields of buildings and agriculture. The chalk becomes part of the cement mixture because it has its glue properties and changes its appearance.

This image is a combination of the appearances of pagan deities, including Pan, Poseidon, and Bes. Satan also appears in Christian literature, especially in Dante Alighieri's book Inferno. Satan himself still appears in movies, television programs, and music. At first the term \"devil\" in the Jewish Scriptures was only used as a word that would mean \"against\" or \"accustom,\" some of which can be seen in verse (1 Samuel 29:4) where the Chief of the Philistine feared that David would be their \"Satan.\" In the Book of 22:22, God sent an angel to be the \"Satan\" of Balaam who went with the Moabites who intended to attack Israel.",

The fat is specifically called animal oil at the temperature of space, free from its dense and liquid form, which is found in the body tissue called adiposa. In adiposa tissue, fat cells emit leptin and resistin hormones that play a role in the immune system, cytoxin hormones that play a role in intercellal communication. The cytokina hormones produced by the adiposal tissue are specifically called the adipokin hormones, including the adypokin, the interleukin-6, the plasmogen activator inhibitor-1, the retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4), the necrosis factor-alpha tumor, the visphine, and the metabolacteric hormones like the adiponicine hormone and the adiconic hormone (Ach). Because its molecular structure is rich in carbon-particle chains, it has a hydrophob properties. This is an excuse that explains how hard fat is to dissolve in water. Fats can dissolve only in non polar or organic solution such as: ether, Chloroform, or benzol can generally be said that fat meets the basic functions of humans, namely: fat is also a means of circulatory energy in the body and the primary components that form membranes of all kinds of cells. Eukaryotic cells are rounded up into organelles of bonds that perform different biological functions. Gliserofosfolipid is a major structural component of a biological membrane, such as a cellular plasma membrane and an intracellular organel membrane; inside animal cells plasma membranes physically separate intracellular components from extracellular environments. Glissophospholipid is an amphipathic molecule (containing hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions) that contains the glycerol core associated with two \"tails\" derivatives of fatty acids by ester bonds and to one group of \"heads\" by a phosphate ester.",

In plants and algas, galactosylsylglycerol, and sulfocinovosylsylglycerol, which lacks a phosphate group, is an important component of chloroplast membranes and related organs and is the most abundant lipid in the photosynthesis network, including high plants, alga, and certain bacteria. Dwilayers have been found to show off the high levels of the double habit that can be used to check levels of sequencing (or chaos) in dwi-layers using techniques such as dual polarization interferometry. Triasalglycerol, stored in adiposal tissue, is the main form of energy reserves in the animal body. Adiposit, or fat cell, is designed for synthesis and the synthesis of triasalglycerol, with a solution primarily controlled by the chormon-sensitive enzyme activation, lipase. The complete oxidation of fatty acid provides high-calor matter, approximately 9 kcal/g, compared with 4 kcal/g for solving carbohydrates and proteins. Hijing birds that had to fly at long distances without eating use triasalglycerol energy reserves to burn their journeys. In recent years, evidence has revealed that lipid content is an important part of the cell's splicing. The lipid content can appear through the activation of a pair of G protein receptors or nuclear receptors, and members of several different lipid categories have been identified as the saturated molecules and the second courier system. All of this includes sphingosina-1-phosphate, sfingolipid which is derived from the grimides of the potential courier molecules involved in the arrangement of calcium, cell growth, and apoptosis; diasylglycerol (DAG) and phosphoid phosphoryol phosphate (PIPs), which is involved in the activation of calcium C proteins, prostagininized proteins; prostagin, which is one type of acid that is derived from the anticonaoidsoidsities involved in the field and resistance; hormones such as estrogengen, and cortol, which modulates, and metabolisms, and blood, and pressure, and oxysterical, like 25-osterial acidity, the Xesteric formula.",

And S. alaibum Thom, over there used his leaves as slaps. S. Ratiatum also contains oil, but it has a bitter flavor because it is mixed with a spousal sapin that is also poisonous. Presently, sesames are grown mainly in India, China, Egypt, Turkey, Sudan, and Mexico and Venezuela. Sesames grow in the tropics at an altitude of 1200 feet [1200 m] above sea level. This plant requires a pretty high air temperature in its lifetime, which is 25 to 35 \u25aaC and is quite resistant to dry conditions. The value of a good land pH is 5.5-8.0. It cannot be grown on sand or salt. It also cannot grow in a constant state of water and rain. This plant should be planted on fields lined up at a distance between three inches [30 cm]. Sesame can be harvested after 120-150 days. The roots of this plant have a type of tufting root with many branches that are often symbiotic with the VA micoriza (vesicular-arbuscular). Plants benefit from this symbiosis in obtaining water and nutrients from the soil. His morphological appearance is easily influenced by the environment.

Sesame culture can be an alternative to farmers in rainfields, both on moors and on fields after rice, including farmers with narrow land. Farmers in Sumoharjo and Rembang overcome drought by planting sesame in fields after rice. The results that were obtained were very encouraging because sesame quality was better than in the rainy season. Sweet - and - Fiber Plant Research Hall has produced several varieties of superior sesames with high productivity levels. Dryland farmers can use a variety of Sourcerejo (Sbr) 1, Sbr 2, or Sbr 3.

With his cousin Duryodana, his father often planned the murder of five Pandawa, the nephew of King Dretarastra. In Mahabharata it is told that the Sangkuni managed to defeat the Pandava in a game of dice with an exile penalty bet. When the Pandava returned from their exile, Ukauk went to pick up his father who lived in Hastinapura to return to Gandhara. However, Sangkuni refused because he and Duryodana planned to destroy the Pandava in a great war. In Udyogaparwa (the 5th of Mahabharata), before the war began, Duryodana sent scares to the Pandawa camp, to deliver verbal messages and insults to the Pandas (Yudistira, Bima, Arjuna, Nakula, and Sadullah) along with their allies (Wirata, Drudadi, Srikandi, Drestedyna, and Kresna) as psychological tactics. The Milky Way is furious after hearing the message from the Injury. Kresna interrupted and immediately sent the wound back in peace, as was only a messenger, but the wound refused to leave until the whole message was delivered. Everyone who was given a message gave a reply to Duryodana with a middleman. He came back after delivering all the messages to Pandawa's fort. Shortly thereafter, both theura and Pandawa will prepare for each other's strengths. When the prepared war began, the wounds sided with Korawa, just as his father did. He was involved in a fierce battle with his cousin Yuyutsu, who was thought to have been turned for turning from Korawa's fort to Pandawa. In the end, he was killed by the Sadive, the youngest among the Pandawa. This Mahabharata topic is a groan.",

In a capambexa there are organisms such as Coccidia, Gregarine, pilopollast, haemogregarine, and malaria; some diseases caused by a firecombexa organism are: Firecopllast organelles, which are non-colored plastids. Aapcoplast comes from red algae through the endombiotic process that occurred at the beginning of eukaryotic evolution. Most of the aposplexes are unicellular endoparocytes in animals that cause some tropical diseases. Except for Nephromyce, which is a mutualism symbiosis between a firecomplexa and marine animals, which was originally classified as cythrid fungus. A firecombexa which is an endoparasit raises hope where a fireclast can be a drug target for two reasons. The first reason is, apicoplasmoplasmodium and Toxoplasm defense. The second reason is that effective drugs to procariatic organism are likely to be effective against firecoplasm, since plastid originally evolved from endosymbiotic cynotic cynobacteria procariots. The apicomplexa is highly dependent on the apicoplasm, which leads to speculation that this organelle is a parasitic protensitivity of heels like Plasmodium. The name taxon Apicomplex is derived from two Latin words called apex (top) and complex (infold), which refers to a set of organelles in sporozoite. Complex is made up of a large number of what is commonly called Sporozoa, a parasitic protozoan group, usually without flagella, silia, or pseudopods.

BMW started his business after restructuring of aircraft-making company Rapp Motorenwerke in 1917. The end of World War I in 1918, BMW was forced to stop producing aircraft engines because of the Treaty of Versailles. The company switched to produce a motorcycle in 1923 after the treaty began to loosen, and began producing a 1928/29 car. In 1992, BMW acquired an industrial design studio company in California DesignsUSA, and acquired it fully in 1995. In 1994, BMW bought the British automotive company Rover Group (where there were then Rovers, Land Rovers and MGs and also rights to brands that were no longer produced by Austin and Morris) and had them for six years. In 2000, Rover suffered a huge loss and BMW sold it. The MG and Rover were sold to Phoenix Consortium to form an MG Rover, while the Land Rover was taken over by Ford.

When Paul first came to the city (about 51-52 C.E.), Galio was governor of Achaia (51-53 C.E.). According to Acts of the apostles 18, Paul stayed 18 months in Corinth. This was where he first met Aquila and Priscilla. Krispus, the head of the synagogue in Corinth, became a believer in the Lord with the rest of his house, after listening to Paul's preaching, and giving himself up for baptism. Besides Krispus and his family, Paul baptized Gaius and Stephen and his family. A year and a half later the head of the synagogue was occupied by Sosthenes who was also a Christian and was persecuted by Jews in front of the courthouse.

The period that got his name from one of the tribes in Wales, Ordovices, this was defined by Charles Lapworth in 1879 to complete the percentage between Adam Sedgwick and Roderick Murchison's followers who grouped the same rock layers in northern Wales into the Cambrian and Silang. Lapworth observed that animal fossils in this disputed strata differ from animals during both the Cambrian and the Silar period so that they should have their own periods. This period is divided into 3 times, the early Ordovicium, the central Ordovium, and the final Ordovium. During this period the sea level was very high. The shallow epeics are the locations where the rocks of this period are highly guarded. During the Ordovium period, the southern continents fused into Gondwana supercontinents. Gondwana first formed around the equator, but, as time went by, it moved toward the south pole. In the Early Ordovium, Laurentia's continent (the present - day North American), Siberia, and the Baltic (Today's Europe) remains an indenpendent continent. During this period, life continued to flourish, but, at the end of the period, a mass extinction event called Mass Extinction Ordovium-Silang took place. Animals of the type of plankton, such as conodanta, gruptolite, some types of trilobites, Brachiopods, Byrozoa, and enchinodermata are affected greatly by this event. And even worse, the entire types of cone-shaped neutyloids disappeared completely. This extinction may have occurred because of the ice age that occurred at the end of the period. The first plant was believed to ascend to land at about this period. The plant, however, is very simple. They have no roots, no trunks, no leaves.",

Kentucky is also famous for its thoroughbred horses, horse racing, whiskey distilling bourbon, bluegrass music and high school basketball. In 1776 the Virginia district outside the Appalachia Mountains was known by European-Americans as Kentucky County, named for the Kentucky River. The correct etymology of the name is uncertain, but it's probably based on the Iroquoian name meaning \"the meadow\" or \"the meadow\" (reply). Mohawk kenht\u00e0:ke, Seneca g\u00ebd\u00e1'geh (fonemis /k Others recommend the term Kenta Aki, which is probably from the Algonquian language and probably from Shawnee.

By about the 10th century, Kentucky's native variety of corn became very productive, replaced Eastern Farm complex, and replaced it with a corn-based farm in the Mississippi era. French explorers in the 17th century documented many tribes that lived in Kentucky until the Beaver War in the 1670s; but when European explorers and colonial settlers began to enter greater numbers in the middle of the 18th century, there were no large native American settlements in the region.

The discovery of inscriptions on a number of archaeological sites marks the end of prehistoric times, a chapter in the ancient history of Indonesia whose people are not familiar with writing, leading to historical times, where people are familiar with writing. The study of inscriptions is called Epigraphy. Among the sources of ancient Indonesia's history, such as foreign texts and news, inscriptions are considered the most important source of being able to give chronological events. There are many things that make an inscription very profitable to the world of ancient research. In addition to the date element, inscriptions also reveal a number of names and reasons why the inscription was released. In a modern sense in Indonesia, inscriptions are often associated with inscriptions on headstones or in buildings, especially at the time of the laying of the first stone or the unveiling of a construction project. In mass media news, for example, we often hear presidents, vice presidents, ministers, or regional heads inaugurating building A, building B, and so on with ribbon editing and signing inscriptions.

Flowers (also) appear directly from the stem (cauliflorous) or the old branches at the base (proximal), grouped together with 3-10 kontums in the shape of paakal or flat. The blossoms are round, about two centimeters in diameter, long range. The flower petals form tubes along lk. 3 centimeters, extra petal leaves split into 2-3 egg - shaped lobes. The maki-shaped crown, approximately two\u00d7-length petals, numbering five strands, whiteness. The strains are many, divided into five files; the putik head forms a bowl, with hairy stalks. Flowers emerge from the buds of dorman, blossoming in the afternoon and lasting up to a few days. At noon flowers close. The flower spreads a scent derived from the nectar gland at its base to draw the bats ' attention as its main pollinators. Studies in Malaysia in the 1970s showed that the durian pollinator was an Eonycteris spelaea bat. Further research in 1996 has shown that other animals, such as the Nectariniidae honeybird and the bees contribute to the pollination of three other durian relatives.",

There are some other terrestrial artropods that, though not insects, such as centipedes, thousand feet, scorpions, spiders, wood bugs, mites, and ticks, are often considered to be insects because they seem somewhat similar to having exoskeletons. But most of them are not hexpods. Insects are highly adaptive animals. Fossils can be traced back to the time of Ordovicius. Fossil cockroaches and primitive giant dragonflies have been found. A number of diptera members such as flies and mosquitoes trapped in sap were also found. This animal is also a classic example of metamorphosis. Each insect undergoes a change in shape from the egg to an adult form that is ready to reproduce. These changes in body shape are often very dramatic. Inside each stage is also a process of \"skin change\" commonly referred to as the suspension process. These stages are called instars. The insect order is often characterized by its metamorphosis type. The metamorphosis in insects is 2, which is perfect metamosphosis and metamorphosis is imperfect. A striking difference in perfect metamorphosis is the formation stage of cocoons, whereas in imperfect metamorphosis there is no stage of cocoon formation. Morphologically, the adult insect's body can be distinguished into three main parts, while preevolved forms usually resemble its ancestors, soft animals age like worms. The three parts of the adult insect's body are the head, the chest, and the abdomen.

They had to leave their virginity for 13 years. Knowing this, Rewati (the Balarama wife) said that a prince who had lost his kingdom was no longer a prince, so it could be likened to a commoner. Hence, their daughter did not deserve to marry Abhimanyu, who now has the status of a commoner. Balarama accepted his wife's advice, and then she broke the engagement between Abhimanyu and her daughter. Instead of Abhimanyu, he set up his daughter with Lakshman, prince Duryodana's son. Abhimanyu was very disappointed by Balarama's decision. Then he called for help from his uncle Kresna.

There are two versions of the story in Tulungagung County naming. The first version is the name \"Pregnant\" believed to be derived from the word \"Grand Hall.\" This name comes from the time a young man from Mount Wilis named Joko recently dried up the water source in Ngrowo (the former Tulungagunga tempo) by clogging all the water sources with lidi from an enau or aren tree. New joko was described as a young man who was cursed to be a snake by his father, people around him often refer to him as New Klinthing. His father said that to return to being a real man, New Joko should be able to wrap her body around Wilis Mountain. But, unfortunately, it struck him because his body was just a little less narrow in order to be completely circular. As a result, New Joko puts out her tongue. At the same time, Yoko's father just cut out his tongue. Miraculously, the tongue turns into a spear of magic which, until recently, is believed to be a man or a weapon of power. These spears are still kept and cared for until now by the surrounding people. On the other hand, the second version of Tulungagong is two words, tungung and grand, tungung means a great source, and it is great. In that sense of Javanese, Tulungagung is a large water source.

According to medieval Armenian sources, the city was first mentioned as Vararatak (which means \"a swift spring\"), which was then transformed into Khankendi in 1847. Azerbaijan sources say that this city was founded at the end of the 18th abaad by a Khan of Karabakh, and since then this city has been called Khankendi (the Turkish word for \"Desa Khan\"). In 1923, Khankendi was renamed Stepanakert by the Soviet government in honor of Stepan Shahumyan, a leader of 26 Armenian Baku Commissioners.

Only in Daniel did Michael appear as \"one of the chief princes\" who Daniel saw come to the aid of the angel Gabriel in his battle against the Persian angel. He was also described as the defender of Israel (10:21, 12:1). The Talmud tradition explains that he is \"like El (God)\" (but literally means \"Such as El\") (similar to Micah, one of the later prophets), but according to Rabbi Simeon ben Tuish (230-270 C.E.), all the specific names of the angels were brought back by the Jews of Babylon. Many modern interpreters agree with this statement. Michael is one of the principal angels of Abrahamic tradition. His name is said to be a battle cry for the angels in the battle they fought in heaven against Satan and his followers. In late Middle Ages Christianity, Michael together with St. George became protector of the knights, and protector of the first warrior order of France, the Order of Saint Mikael in 1469. In the honor system of Britain, a warrior class was formed in 1818 and was also named after these saints, the Order of St. Michael and St. George. The Orthodox Catholics and Christians refer to it as St. Mikael the Archangel, or the Great Angel Mikael, as well as in a shorter form as Saint Mikael.

The rabbis claim that Michael began to be a defender from the time of the ancients in the Bible.

Their story is related in the Hebrew Bible and the Old Testament in the Christian Bible, which is in Genesis chapter 4 and in the Qur'an in Surah 5:27-32. In both versions Cain committed the first murder by killing his brother after God rejected his sacrifice, but he accepted Abel's sacrifice. The Genesis account puts pressure on the work of these two brothers; Abel shepherds cattle, while Cain is a farmer. Cain and Abel are transliterated by names in Hebrew: in the Qur'an, Abel is called H\u0101bl; Cain is not mentioned in the Qur'an, although the Muslim tradition records his name Q\u0101b. Cain is called Qayen in the Ethiopian version of Genesis, although in other places such as Judas's Letter (Yudas 1:11), he is referred to as Qayel's variant, and by this name he is more commonly referred to in sermons. Some have proposed that Abel's name should be identified by the word in Ashur aplu, which simply means \"son.\" A largely held English folk etymology says that Abel was made up of ab and el, so it practically means that he was God's source.

This story continues with God who approached Cain and asked him where Abel was. Cain's answer to what came to be a very well - known saying was: \"Am I my brother's keeper?\" And God saw that Cain was trying to escape, because he said unto Cain, Thy brother's blood cried unto me from the ground. God condemned Cain to wander the earth. Cain was afraid that he would be killed by others on earth and in fear of God, and God gave him a mark on his face so that he would not be killed, saying, \"Whoever kills Cain will be repaid to him seven times over.\" And Cain went, \"To a land of wanderings.\" Other translations say that he went \"to Nod Land,\" which is generally thought to be a translation error from the Hebrew word Nod, meaning ody.",

Antraks most frequently attack herbivore-herbivores wild and tamed. The disease is zoonosis that means it can be transmitted from animal to human, but it cannot be transmitted between fellow humans. Anthrax comes from anthrax, a Greek word for charcoal. This term is used because of the emergence of black lesions caused by anthrax infections in the form of kutaneus. The presence of a black eskar surrounded by bright - red skin has long been known as the characteristic of the disease. Anthrax is thought to have existed since the Bronze Age, when it became a problem on sheep farms that produce wool. Historically, anthrax is known by various names showing symptoms, locations, and groups that are considered most vulnerable to infection. These names include charcoal disease, malignant carburec, spleen fever or spleenitis, Bradford's disease, Cumberland disease, wool control disorder, and plant disease. Anthrax Kutaneus occurs when a B. anthracic spore enters the skin; generally through a cut or cut skin. It's the most discovered, least harmless form of anthrax. A person acquires testaneus anthrax after contact with an animal or animal product contaminated with bacterial spores, such as moths, hair, or wool. Nevertheless, the spore can also be carried away by insects that then bite off the skin and cause testaneous anthrax. Primary skin lesions generally appear within three to five days of exposure to an itchy papula that causes no pain. Within 24 to 36 hours, a vesicula developed necrosis in its center and then dried up until it formed a black eskar (characterical of this disease) surrounded by edema and a number of vesicula purpids.",

Local infections will subside within seven to ten days after giving antibiotics. The skin will recover within a few weeks, depending on the size, location, severity of the lesions. The healing process can't be accelerated by drug delivery. Complications can occur in a number of cases. The fever and eskar that are pained and festering are a feature of secondary infections, while the widespread edema and ethrema are signs of heavy anthrax Kutaneus. In December 2009, the anthrax case occurred in 14 heroin users in Scotland, killing seven of them. Heroin injected into their bodies, both intravenously and intracularly, is contaminated with spore B. anthrax. These injections reflect serious tissue infections, arthritis and abscess in the injection area, necrotic fasciitis, edema - accompanied cellulitis, and systemic sepsis that lead to death within hours. The virulence factor of this disease is caused by B. anthracic from capsules and toxins. The pod of B. anthracis consists of harmless poly D-glutamic acid itself. This capsule is produced by pX02 plasmid and works to protect cells from phagocytes and lysis. The toxin produced by B. anthracis comes from pX01 plasmid which has AB models (activating and binding). The toxin of B. anthracis consists of three types, which are protective antigens that are derived from poly D- glutamic acid capsules, edema factor (EF), and lethal factor (LF).

It is related in the book of Bhagawatapurana and Vishnupurana in the case of the gem of Shamantaka. It is told that he died wearing shamantaka. A relative of Prasena's accused Kresna of murder in order to seize the gem, so Kresna sought to possess Prasena's death to clear her good name. In the book of Bhagawatapurana it is told that the jewel of Shinamtaka is the precious jewel of the Surya God given to Satrajit, brother Prasena. Kresna suggested that Satrajit give the gem to Ugrasena, king of the Yadavs, but she refused. Instead, he left the gem with Prasena. While hunting, Prasena put the gem around her neck. In the middle of the forest, he encountered a fierce lion. The lion killed Prasena and the horse she was riding. Finally, the lion snatched the jewel of Shamanataka. But the lion was killed by a bear named Jembawan. The gem of Shamanataka fell into the hands of the master. The unrelenting Prasena from hunting activities caused anxiety among the Yamawa. Satrajit accused Kresna of being the killer for the reason that Kresna wanted the Shimantaka gem. To end the rumors, Kresna followed Prasena's footsteps. After tracing his tracks into the woods, he found Prasena lifeless. When the body was found, the Shomantaka gem was gone, but there was another trace on the scene, followed by Kresna. The trail leads to the carcass of a lion, apparently killed by a bear because there was a bear trail around the scene. The bear's trail was followed by a Kresna that led to a cave in Jembawan's home. Upon discovering that Symantaka was in the hands of Jembawan, Kresna was going to take it back, but Jembabar refused to hand it over so that the battle was fought.",

The main ingredient of this dish is the frog's foot (generally from the green coot) or the ijo spoon (Jw.) With garlic, ginger, and tauco, salt, and pepper. Served with fried garlic and celery leaves on it, swike is usually served with white rice. Some argue that the taste and texture of the swike are a mixture between the chicken and the fish. Only parts of the frog's thigh are used for swike, but the skin can be dried and fried into frog skin chips. Another way to cook swipe is \"toadpes,\" boneless toads are cooked in clusters of banana leaves as pepes.

This project was intended to fight a supersonic plane that was nimble and low-flying. British Aircraft Corporation at the time had a self-sustaining Sightline program that was the basis of ET.316. The cancellation of Mauler means ET.316 will be developed. Going into surgery at the British military in 1971, because of accuracy, these missiles rely on live collision warheads, not large proximity fuse warheads like any other missile. Initial versions rely on optical tracers, the next version added Blindfire radar trace (DN181) and optronic tracers (electronics). A cheaper export version with a laser tracer known as Laserfire. The rapier originally shaped a four - wheeled launcher with four missiles, a unit of FSB2 optical tracking and a trailer for pumping, the whole package and crew were transported by three Land Rover vehicles. Usually for the air field defense. With added radar tracking units, enemy aircraft can be identified early so that the operator can select whether the launch takes place automatically or manually. The version Tracked Rapid uses the American M548 tracked carriers designed on the order of the Iranian Shah government, but it was canceled following the Islamic revolution in Iran. Tracked Rapider is ready to operate in 30 seconds, compare it to a drag version that takes 30 minutes.

In addition, sefalotox is also a pair of antennas, upper jaws, and lower jaws. While the abdomen had five pairs of swimming feet and at the end was a tail. In female shrimps, feet in the abdomen also serve to store eggs. The digestive system of crustaceans begins with mouth, esophagus, stomachs, intestines, and anus. The rest of the metabolism will be secreted through the fire cells. The crustacean nervous system is referred to as the rope ladder's nervous system, where the ganglion head (brain) is connected to the antenna (Indra touch), the eyes (indra sight), and the statosista (in balance).

His close relationship with Indra made him a brother. In Weda, Vishnu appeared not as one of Aditya's eight, but as their leader. Being able to step in three realms, Vishnu is known as Tri-wikram or Uru-krama for his wide stride. His first step on earth, his second step in the sky, and his third step in a world that humans cannot see, that is, in heaven. In the book of Purana, Vishnu often appears and materializes as an Awatara, such as Rama and Kresna, who appears in Itihasa (wiracita Hindu). In his poem, Vishnu played the role of superior man. In the book of Bhagawadgita, Vishnu described religious teachings by taking on the figure as Sri Kresna, the coachman Arjuna, toward the war in Kurukshetra took place. At that time Sri Kresna appeared to be the spiritual figure of Vishnu, and then she appeared to Arjuna. In Purana, and as a general representation, the Lord Vishnu is described as a black-and-blue god or a dark blue god; four arms, each holding: gada, lotus, prejudicer, and chakra. The most identical to Vishnu is the chakra gun and its dark blue skin. In Waisnawa's philosophy, Vishnu is mentioned as having different forms or having certain aspects.

According to classical rabbinic literature, Judah was born on the 15th of the month Siwan; classical sources differ in time of death. The book of Jubilee mentions it as dying at the age of 119, 18 years before the death of Levi, but the book of Jaser (midesh) supports the claim that Judah died at the age of 129. The Torah text notes that the name Judah referred to Leah's intention to praise Yahweh, having succeeded in having four children. The name of Judah is of an adh, which means I will lift up my praise. In classical rabbinic literature, this name is interpreted as a combination of the name of God and a dalett (letter d in Hebrew alphabet); in Gematria (letter number), the dateet has a 4. According to rabbinic sources, this figure refers to Judah as Jacob's fourth son. Some Bible critics believe that Judah's name appeared later on, an eponim metaphor to give an ethyology about this tribe's connection to other tribes in the Israeli confederation. With Leah as a matriarch, Bible scholars consider this tribe to be believed by the authors of the text to be part of the original Israeli confederation.

In the early days of the revelations, Weda was passed down with a oral learning system from mouth to mouth, which in those days the writings had not yet been found from teacher to student. Once the writings were discovered, the Resi poured the teachings of Weda into the form of writing. Weda is of what sort, because it is of revelation, not man-made, and permanence. The Fey Maharesi, reassembled Weda and divided Weda into four main parts: Regweda, Yajurweda, Samadida and Atharwaweda. It was all arranged in the early Kaliyuga. Ethymologically, the word Weda is rooted in the word vid, which in Sanskrit means \"know\" in the language of Indo-Eropa is rooted in the word weid, which means \"see\" or \"know.\" Weid is also the root word of wit in English, as Latin vision says. Upaweda is a descendant of Weda which is a more specific science major in life applications. Upaweda is classified in a number of majors, among other things: Some fields of science such as Jyotisha (Astrology), Tantra, Shiksha and Vyakara (The Language of the Language) are also based on Weda. The Book of Weda contains the primitive concept of creation and its existence. One concept of creation is presented with an example of plants. In Weda, the stage of plant creation is referred to as a network of Indras.",

Oxidation is a chemical reaction that can produce free radicals, thus triggering a chain reaction that can damage cells. Antioxidants such as tiol or askorbat acid (vitamin C) end this chain reaction. To keep balance in oxidation levels, plants and animals have a complex system of carrying antioxidants, such as glutation and enzymes (e.g.: catalase and superoxide dysmase) that are produced internally or can be obtained from vitamin C, vitamin A and vitamin E. Antioxidants can actually slow or inhibit oxidation of substances that are easily oxidized even in low concentrations. Antioxidants are also appropriately defined as compounds that protect the cell from the harmful effects of reactive radical oxygen free when it comes to disease, these free radicals can come from body metabolism as well as other external factors. Free radicals are unstable species because they have electrons that don't pair up and look for electrons in biological macromolecules. Lipida proteins and DNA from healthy human cells are a good source of electron pairs. oxidation conditions can cause protein and DNA damage, cancer, aging, and other diseases. Chemical components that act as antioxidants are phenolic and polyphenolic compounds. These clusters are abundant in nature, especially in vegetation, and have the ability to capture free radicals. Antioxidants found largely in food products include vitamin E, vitamin C, and carotenoid. Antioxidants are widely used in food supplements and have been studied for the prevention of diseases such as cancer or coronary heart disease.

The Muslim tradition usually mentions that Jonah preached first, then he went and boarded the ship because his call was rejected, then thrown into the sea and swallowed fish. The Bible records that Jonah was directed to Nineveh, but he fled to the ship and was swallowed up by fish. After regurgitating, Jonah went to Nineveh and called its inhabitants. Jonah was a prophet of the kingdom of Israel (Samaria) in the 8th century B.C.E., living during the reign of Samaria's king Jeroboam son of Jehoash. He lived after the time of the Prophet Ilyas (Elia) and Ilysa (Elisa). In the Jews, Jonah was one of the twelve little prophets whose Book became part of the Tanakhs.

In distillation, a mixture of substances is boiled so that it evaporates, and this steam is then cooled back into liquid form. The substance that has a lower boiling point will evaporate first. This method includes a chemical operation unit of the kind of mass displacement. The application of this process is based on the theory that in a solution, each component will evaporate at its boiling point. The ideal model of distillation was based on Raoult's Law and Dalton's Law. The first distillation was discovered by Greek chemists about the first century a mere development triggered primarily by the high demand for spiritus. Hypathia from Alexandria was believed to have found a series of tools for distillation and Zosimos of Panopolis that have been accurately describing the process of distillation in about the third century. Modern forms were first stimulated by Islamic chemists at the time of Abbasiates, especially by Al-Razi on the separation of alcohol into relatively pure compounds through alembic devices, even this design became a kind of inspiration that allowed microscale design, The Hickman Stillhead to be realized. Written by Jabir Ibn Hayyan (721-815) better known as Ibn Jabir mentions burning wine vapor. He has also discovered a lot of equipment and chemical processes that are still widely used to this day. Then the distillation technique was clearly described by Al-Kindi (801-873).

There are also extractive distillations and azeotropic dystilation homogeneous, distilled using beron salt, distillation pressure-swing, and reactive dystilation. In a simple distillation, the basis of separation is the difference between the boiling point and one of the volatile components. If the mixture is heated then the components with the lower boiling point will evaporate first. Besides the difference in boiling points, it's also the difference in volatity, which is the tendency of a substance to become a gas. This distillation is done on atmospheric pressure. Simple distillation applications are used to separate mixtures of water and alcohol. The function of distillation fractionation is to separate liquid components, two or more, from a solution based on the difference in the boiling point.

And in this column, there's a gradual warming of different temperatures on each plate. These different warmings are aimed at purifying the distilates that are more than the plates below.

        "paragraph": "The symbol comes from the Greek symbalo which means throwing together, throwing or putting together in one idea or the idea of an object that is visible, so the object represents the idea. Symbols can lead a person into ideas of both the future and the past. Symbols manifest in images, shapes, movements, or objects that represent an idea. Although symbols are not the value themselves, but symbols are necessary in the interest of fantasizing the values represented by them. Symbols can be used for anything, as much as science, social life, as well as religion. The shape of the symbol is not only an invisible object but also through motion and speech. The symbol is also designated as one of the language infrastructures, known as the symbol language. The most common symbol is writing, which is a symbol of words and sounds. A symbol can be a real object, like a cross and a staff. Symbols can be color or pattern. Symbols are often used in poetry and other types of literature, mostly used as metaphors or illustrations. The national emblem is a symbol for certain countries. The biggest human mistake in understanding the symbol is to assume that the symbol is substance. So they are often caught up in justification of all things that are only visible as truth. The estuary of that error is bigotry. Case example: Religion X refers to God as X1, whereas Y is called Y1. Each religion claims that the true one is in their own way. And they say, \"We hear and we obey.\" The same is true of the language spoken. A religion uses the A1 language both in its scriptures, as well as in its manner of worship. On the other hand, religion B chose to use the B1 language.",

In fascist mindsets, the enemy is everywhere, both on the battlefield and in the nation itself as an element that doesn't conform to fascist ideology. In fascist ideology, individuality is lost and followers become a uniform mass where individuals simply become a tool to achieve the purpose of the fascist movement. Fascist movements include radical movements of political authoritarian national ideology. In fascist ideologies, mass cannot have a variety of identities and a duty to uniform. Individuality is lost because blinity is forbidden, the collapse of individual identity impacts floating masses led by charismatic leaders with absolute power. In fascist countries it's usually a capitalist economic structure running by placing humans as tools for the development of the country. Political and economic elites working together and ultra-nationalistic ideology keep ordinary citizens unconscious or unconcerned economic hierarchies-political. They advocated the formation of a single totalitarian party that attempted to mobilize the mass of a nation and the creation of the ideal \"new man\" to form an elite government through indoctrination, physical education, and including eugenic family policy. Fascist believed that the nation needed strong leadership, a single collective identity, and the ability to do violence and fight to protect a strong nation. The Fascist government prohibits and suppresses opposition against the country.

Fascist violence sees war as an act that creates regenerating spirit, nationalism and vitality. Fascism is anticommunism, anti-demoncratic, antiinvidualist, antiliberal, antiparlement, anticonservative, anti-borjutic, antiindividualist, anti-liberal, anti-parlementist. In many cases Fascism rejects the concepts of egalitarianism, materialism, and rationalism that promote action, discipline, hierarchy, passion, and desire. In economic science, fascists oppose liberalism and Marxism (as a proletar movement) to become an exclusive class-based economy of this Fascist movement. Their ideologies are like those performed by trans-class economic movements that promote the resolution of economic class conflicts to secure national solidarity. They support an integrated, multi-class national economic system. Fascismo is a term derived from the Latin word \"fassess.\" Fassess, consisting of the serum of stems tied to axes, was a symbol of the authority of ancient Roman civil judges, as well as glory. They were brought in by littors and could be used for his physical and capital punishment by His command. The word fascismo is also associated with political organizations in Italy known as fasci, groups similar to unions or syndicates. The phaseal symbolism suggests strength through unity: a single rod is easily broken, while a grove will be difficult to break. Similar symbols were developed by different fascist movements.

The name \"Hebron\" comes from the Hebrew name for this city, originally derived from the word \"habar 598,\" meaning \"united, combined, intertwined.\" The name \"Hebron\" can be traced to the same root as \"Heber.\" In Arabic, \"The Friend\" shows that, according to the original Islamic teaching, God chose the Prophet Abraham as His chosen servant. Hebron is 30 km south of Jerusalem. The city is famous for wine, limestone, ceramic workshops and blow glass factories. Hebron is also the site of a large dairy plant, Al-Juneidi.

The Sabbath was celebrated from Saturday night until Saturday evening. This celebration was carried out by many Jews with various levels of involvement in Judaism. From this Sabbath came the English word Sabbath, Sabt in Arabic, and Saturday in English. This word also comes up with the concept of \"sabatical,\" which is to stop working on the Sabbath. The Jews viewed the Sabbath observance, as the seventh day of each week, uninterrupted from the date God created the universe, in which man was created on the sixth day. The Hebrew word shabbat comes from the verb shabat, in the same language, which literally means \"stop,\" or shev which means \"sit.\" Although Shabbat is almost universally translated \"break\" or a \"break time,\" a more literal translation is \"stop,\" with the implications of \"stopping from doing the job.\" So the Sabbath is a day for people to stop working, with its implications rested. The Hebrew word for \"mogok\", for example, comes from the same Hebrew root as Shabbat, and it has the same implications, which is that workers who actively break down stop doing work, and not passively \"rest\" This happens to explain the theological question often posed about why God needs to \"rest \" on the seventh day of the creation of the universe, as described in Genesis chapter 1.

Other examples are Exodus 31:12-17, Exodus 35:2-3, Leviticus 19:3, Leviticus 19:30, Leviticus 23:3 and Numbers 28:9-10 (Corban).

Cold atoms with spin-orbit-coupling, contact interactions and long-range interactions can provide the system for the research phase supersidified.

Very little interest because of lack of experimental evidence, has attracted a powerful experimental theoreticity in the last year's span since Kim and Chan (Penn State, USA) which reports evidence for the nonclassic inertia effect, a typical sign of superfluidity, in a Helium-4 solid sample.

After the number of cases dropped dramatically since the worldwide supply of immunoficiency in the 1940s, the rate of infections again increased since the millennium change in many countries, sometimes appearing along with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This number is caused in part by unsafe sex practices and a decrease in the use of protection during sex.",

This phase is referred to as a \"great copycat\" by Sir William Osler due to its varied appearance. Primary syphilis is generally obtained from direct sexual contact with people infected to others. About 3 to 90 days after the initial infection (e.g. 21 days) the skin wound called Chancre began to appear. These lesions are usually (40 % of time) single, sturdy, painless, itchless skin with a clean base and sharp border between the sizes of 0.3 and 3.0 cm. Though wounds can be removed almost in any form. In its common form, baer's wounds develop from macule to papule and eventually into erosion or ulcer. Sometimes, double lesions may appear (~40%). Double lesions are more common when co-infected with HIV. Less pain or pain (30%), and it can happen out of gender (210:7%). The most common place in women is in cervix (44%), male penis is heterosexual (99%), and anal and rectal are generally relative (men who have sex with men) (34%). The dilation of lymphatic nodes; disobeying 80%) often occurs around the area of infection, taking place for 10 days after the hatch formation. The lesions can last three to six weeks without treatment. Secondary syphilis often occurs four to ten weeks after primary infection. While secondary diseases can be known in a variety of real ways, the most common symptoms are associated with skin, mucus membranes, and lymph nodes. There may be similarities, pinkish-pink, a rash that doesn't itch on stems and extremes, including palms and soles.",

She was a mother to Irawan, one of Arjuna's sons. Not much is known about Ulpui in the Mahabharata Scriptures. He was especially mentioned in the first part of the book, Adiparwa (the part about Arjuna's wandering), then Aswamedhikawawawawawawawawa (the part about Arjuna's natural son's battle between Arjuna and Citr\u0101gad\u0101). He was the one who brought Arjuna back from being killed by Babruwahana. After bringing Arjuna back to life, Ulpui lived with the Kuru family in Hastinapura. When the Pandava and Dropadi decided to make their final journey, Ulpui returned to his original place in the Ganges River. In Sanskrit, Ulupi literally means \"a charming face.\" Urupi is also known by a number of names in the Mahabharata book: Budasatmaja, Bujagendrakaka, Bujagotama, Korawi, Korawyaduhita, Korawyalanandini, Panagandini, Panagasutaka, Panagamaja, Panageswaraka, Panagi, and Uagatmaja. Ulupi was told to be his Nagaka, half a woman and half a snake. Michael Mott in the book Caverns, Cauldrons, and Concealed Creatures relates again that Urupi has half a reptile; its body parts from the lower waist shaped like snakes or crocodiles. In Mahabharata it is stated that Ulupi is the daughter of Korawya, a descendant of a dragon with half a human half a serpent. His father ruled the dragon kingdom in the depths of the Ganges. Ulpui is a capable fighter. In the book of Bhismaparwa, Ulpui is a widow. Her husband was killed by Garuda. He met Arjuna while Arjuna was exploring Northeast India in a year's exile. At that time, Arjuna took a bath in the Ganges that was considered sacred, and then the current dragged her into the middle of the river.",

There Arjuna discovered that there was a ritual fire for prayer, and then she performed a ceremony to the Agni God. The god is satisfied with Arjuna's offerings. Ulpui persuaded Arjuna to marry him. Although Arjuna liked Ulpi, but she refused to marry again for marrying Dropadi. Arjuna stated that she promised not to have sexual relations during her exile. However, Ulpui stated that the promise applies only to Dropadi, not to other women. After being convinced by Ulpi, Arjuna is willing to marry him. From her marriage to Arjuna, Ulupi gave birth to a son named Irawan. The Irawan was raised by his mother in the Dragon Country, and grew up to be a strong and valiant young man like his father. Arjuna stayed with Urupi for a short time, after which she left Korawya's palace. Before leaving, Ulpui gave him the strength to be immune when he was in the water, and all the water creatures would bow to him. On returning to the mainland, Arjuna related her experience to those who lived by the river. The Basu cursed Arjuna after he defeated Bisma through a ruse while fighting in Kurukshetra. When Ulpui learned of the curse, she asked for the help of her father, Korawya. Ayanya faces Goddess Ganga, the mother of Bisma to relieve the curse.

According to Hindu mythology, there are two often hostile races, Adityas (the Aditi descendants, the gods, especially the sun - god groups, the Diti descendants of some kind of demon or giant creature. Whenever a giant falls in battle against the gods, Sukracarya always comes to bring him back to life. The gods also want to gain immortality. On Vishnu's advice, the gods sought to find a sacred drink called amerta. Vishnu also suggested that the gods take the giants to search for the amerta together. The gods and giants seek Amerta in the middle of the milky ocean. They stirred the ocean with a mountain called Mount Mandara. The Basuki Dragon was used as a rope around a mountain, while a giant turtle named Kurma held Mount Mandara from drowning. The gods held the dragon's tail, while the giants held his head. Simultaneously, they turned Mount Mandara by pulling Basuki's dragon body. After stirring after a long time, various treasures emerged from the sea. All of it was taken by the gods. When Tirta amerta appeared, the giants asked that it be theirs because the gods had already acquired too much treasure. To show you a sense of justice, the gods gave the thyta amerta to the giants.

Giants who were aware of cheating the gods immediately took up arms and declared war against the gods. To end the war quickly, Vishnu took the Kakra Sudarsana and released it to the army of giants. They snatched away the giants, and they fled. War is won by the gods. When the gods divided the Amerta, a giant named Rahu came undercover as a god with the intention of enjoying the amerta. Surya and Candra realized this, so they immediately reported it before the Mohini Vishnu. Vishnu immediately released the Kakra Sudarsana. That gun cut off Rahu's throat. Since Rahu drank the Amerta, his head isn't dead, only his body isn't moving. His head is called \"Rahu\" while his body is called \"City.\" Both names are now part of Nawagraha (nine planets) in Hindu astrology.

Shiva's saturated Batara marveled at Bhasmasura's efforts and came to ask him what gift he wanted. Bhasmasura wanted immortality, but Shiva told him that he didn't have the power to give immortality to the living.

This fertile land had grown many ancient civilizations that were magnificent and collectively known as Mesopotamian civilizations. This is the earliest civilization in West Asia and one of the oldest in the world.

In Genesis 11:31, it is said that at one time Abraham's family moved from Ur Ka Tirzahdim to Haran before moving to Canaan (the land of Israel and present - day Palestine). The location of Ur Ka entreatym is usually referred to Tell El-Muqayar, the site of the ruins of ancient Ur from the Sumerian period.

The Mesopotamian term was then more commonly applied to all land between the Euphrates and the Tigris, thus combining not only parts of Syria but also almost all Iraq and Turkey southeast. The steppes west of the Euphrates and west of the Zagros are also often included in Mesopotamia's broader terms. Further differences were usually made between the top or North of Mesopotamia and the low or southern plains of Mesopotamia. northern Mesopotamia was also known as the Jezirah, an area between the Euphrates and the Tigris as far as Baghdad. Southern Mesopotamia consists of southern Iraq, Kuwait, and western Iran. In modern academic use, Mesopotamian terms also have chronological connotations. It is often used to refer this area to the time of Muslim conquest. Names such as Syria, Switzerland, and Iraq are used to describe the region after this time. This term has been debated that this euphemism is a Eurosentris term that was pinned to this area during the time of the 19th century Western addition. Mesopotamia covers the region between the Euphrates and the Tigris as well as the Armenian Highlands.
