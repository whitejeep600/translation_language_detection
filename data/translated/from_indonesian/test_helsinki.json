This Asas stated that legal sanctions can be executed in two ways: first, because the perpetrator carried out his or her actions; second, because he was forced to.

In this case there is a prolonged conflict that has begun since the entry of Dutch colonization in Indonesia and continues to this day. After Indonesia's independence, in 1945, the resolution of conflicts between three legal systems was ongoing, although to this day it has not been complete. This conflict was deliberately created by the invaders to suppress Muslims and at the same time hindered the broader, or even more formal, conduct of Islamic law among our most Muslim societies. Nevertheless, after the era of the occupation of Muslims no longer got the pressure when applying the rules of Islamic law. Even in its development the Muslims managed to modify Islam's laws and make it a part that was not separate from the tax laws. But it's unfortunate, because it's only limited to the formalization of the legal nature of Islamic law, such as the law of marriage, the laws of inheritance, and the law of causation, and it hasn't yet touched criminal law. Until now the clear efforts of Muslims or countries have not been seen to speed up criminal conduct in our country. It seems that Indonesian Muslims themselves have not agreed in that direction, let alone other people who clearly have different rules of religion than Islamic law. One reason why these rules of Islamic criminal law are difficult to apply in Indonesia is that the material does not fit our society and is too cruel and against human rights.

Although it does not have solid surfaces, Saturn is thought to have solid cores. Saturn's shape resembles the speroid of the pincer, a depressed ball that runs along the polar axis to the poles so that there are bumps around the equator. This form appears because of Saturn's rotation, which causes the equatorial radius of 60,268 kilometers to be almost 10% larger than a radius of 54,364 miles from the poles to the poles. Other giant planets, Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune also have this kind of shape, but not too hot like Saturn. The combination between the rotation rate with the bumps around the Saturn equator causes the gravity of the surface of the 8.96 m/s2 on the equator 74% higher than the gravitational surface at the poles and lower than the gravity of the Earth's surface. However, Saturn's escape speed is almost at 36 km/s, much higher than Earth's off speed. Saturn is the only planet in the Solar System whose type mass is lower than the mass of water (about 30% lower).

Saturn's core has a composition similar to the composition of the Earth's nucleus, but Saturn's core composition has greater mass. Saturn's potential gravitational testing using its interior physical model has enabled the creation of the mass restrictions of Saturn's core. In 2004, scientists estimated that the mass of Saturn's core was approximately 9-22 times the mass of the Earth, according to its diameter of about 25,000 kilometers.

Jupiter's thermal energy generated by the mechanism Kelvin Helmholtz from slow gravitational compression is not enough to explain Saturn's heat production because Saturn's mass is smaller than Jupiter's mass. It is estimated that there are alternative or other additional mechanisms that allow Saturn to generate heat through the \"rain\" of helium drips that occur deep within the interior of Saturn.

Most scientists estimate that this cloud pattern is a stationary wave pattern in the atmosphere.

The Hubble image in Saturn's southern polar region shows the existence of jet currents, but no sign of strong polar vortexes or hexagonal stationary waves such as in the North Pole. In November 2006, NASA reported that Cassini's rides had discovered that hurricanes were locked up in the South Pole, showing the existence of clear eye walls.

Saturn has a simple, symmetrical pattern magnetic field. The magnetic force of its equatorial field reaches 0.2 gauss (20 \u25aaT), roughly 1/20 of the power of the magnetic field around Jupiter and is slightly weaker than the Earth's magnetic field. As a result, Saturn's magnetosphere is much smaller than Jupiter's magnetosphere; the size of Saturn's magnetosphere is also determined by solar wind pressure. When Voyager 2 enters Saturn's magnetosphere, its solar wind pressure is high and its magnetosphere extends only 1.1 million kilometers (712,000 mi) or 19 times the radius of Saturn. Nevertheless, the magnetosphere continues to expand in a few hours and remains so for about three days. It is likely that similar to Jupiter, the magnetic field of Saturn is produced by flow in a layer of molten hydrogen metalic called a metallic hydrogen dynamo. This magnetosphere turns out to be efficient to protect Saturn from solar-wind particles from the Sun. One of Saturn's natural satellites, Titan orbits the planet on the outside of its magnetosphere, resulting in the emergence of plasma from ionized particles in Titan's outer atmosphere. Saturn's magnetosphere also produces auroras like the Earth's magnetosphere. Saturn orbits the Sun at an average distance of over 1.4 million kilometers (9).

There is a minor planet orbiting the Sun at a stable Lagrangian point, named L4 and L5, located at a 60\u00b0 angle of Saturn along its orbit. Troya asteroids have also been found circling the planet Mars, Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune. Orbital resonance mechanisms, including secular resonance, are believed to be the cause Saturn has no troya asteroids. Saturn is known to have 82 natural satellites, 53 of which are given an official naming. In addition, there is evidence of tens of up to hundreds of minor satellites in diameter ranging from 40 to 500 meters in the rings of Saturn. Titan, its largest natural satellite, covers 90% of the total mass of all objects surrounding Saturn, including its ring system. Saturn's second largest natural satellite, Rhea, also has a thin atmosphere and ring system. Other satellites are largely small in size: 34 of which have a diameter of less than ten kilometers, whereas 14 other satellites have diameters ranging from 10 and 50 kilometers. Almost all Saturn's satellites are named after Titan gods in Greek mythology. Saturn's largest satellite, Titan, is also the only natural satellite in the solar system that has a thick atmosphere. Titan's atmosphere also contains complex organic chemicals. Titan is also the only natural satellite known to have hydrocarbon lakes. On June 6, 2013, scientists from IAA-CSIC reported the discovery of polycyclic hydrocarbons, a chemical thought to be a precursor for life, in Titan's upper atmosphere. On June 23, 2014, NASA claimed to have solid evidence that Titan's nitrogen in the atmosphere came from material in the Oort cloud associated with comets, and not from the material that formed Saturn in the past.",

This may be proven by the presence of salt-rich particles with ocean-like compositions, thus indicating that most of the ice enceladus is derived from liquid salt water evaporation. In 2015, when Cassini flew through the furs of Enceladus, it discovered that the feathers were made up of materials that could sustain life-forms with methane. In April 2014, NASA scientists reported the possibility of a new natural satellite formation on Ring A enshrined by Cassini on April 15, 2013. Saturn is known to have a planetary ring system that makes it look unique. This ring system stretches from 6,630 km to 120,700 km (4,120 to 75,000 mi) above the equator with an average thickness of approximately 20 meters (60 feet). These rings are dominated by the ice content of water and very few tholin compounds and layers that are showered with about 7% of the intangible carbon. The particles that make up this ring vary in size from as small as dust to 10 meters, although other gas giants also have their own ring system, Saturn's ring system is the largest and most visible. There are two hypotheses about the origin of this ring system. One hypothesis states that this ring system represents the remains of Saturn's natural satellite collapse. The second hypothesis states that this ring system is the remains of a nebula that forms Saturn. Some of the ice particles in the Ring E come from geyser Enceladus. The abundance of water in this ring system is scattered radially, with the outer ring A which has the purest ice content.",

Far outside Saturn's main ring at a distance of 12 million kilometers from the planet lies Phoebe's stretching ring, which tilts at a 27\u00b0 angle against other rings and surrounds Saturn in its retrograde orbit (orbits in opposite direction to its mother planet's rotation) like Phoebe's satellite. Some of Saturn's natural satellites, including Pandora and Prometheus, act as shepherd satellites that hold Saturn's ring system from spreading out. The weak lines of linear fragility in the rings of Saturn caused by Pan and Atlas can produce more religious calculations about the mass of these two satellites. Saturn's observations and exploration are divided into three stages. The first stage was ancient observation (for example with the naked eye) before the discovery of modern telescopes. The second stage began in the 17th century with observations through telescopes from the Earth, which grew as time went on. The third stage is a space ride visit, either that orbits Saturn or that just flies across Saturn alone. In the 21st century, observations used telescopes continued to be made from Earth (including observatorys orbiting the Earth like the Hubble Space Telescope) as well as by orbiters Saturn Cassini before retiring in 2017. Saturn has been known since prehistoric times, and it is a major character in various mythology. Babylonian astronomers have observed and recorded Saturn's movements regularly since ancient times. In ancient Greek, this planet was known as the \"star of Saturn \" and was known in the time of the Roman Empire as the planet's\" star. \" In ancient Roman mythology, the planet Phalanon was considered sacred by a power god called Saturn, whose name was used as the modern name of the planet.

In ancient Japanese and Chinese culture, Saturn is called \"the stars of the earth.\" It's based on the philosophy of the Five Elements that are traditionally used to classify natural elements. In ancient Hebrew, Saturn was called Shabbathai. In Turkish Utsmaniyah and Malay, the name of the planet is Zuhal, which comes from Arabic (Arabic: Essence, translits. Zuhal ). Saturn's ring system can be observed only through a telescope of 15 mm in diameter. Hence, the existence of this ring system was unknown until Christiaan Huygens saw this ring system in 1659. On the other hand, when Galileo made an observation through his telescope in 1610, he thought that the ring system was two satellites trapped on the side of Saturn. This idea was then disputed when Huygens used a higher scale of telescope lenses to observe it and at that point Saturn's ring system was actually seen for the first time. Huygens also discovered Titan's natural satellite; Giovanni Domenico Cassini then discovered four other natural satellites: Lapetus, Rhea, Tethys and Dione. In 1675, Cassini discovered what is currently known as the Cassini Division. There was no other significant discovery until 1789 when William Herschel managed to locate two other satellites, Mimas and Enceladus.

In addition, Pioneer 11 also measures temperature on Titan. In November 1980, Voyager 1 visited the Saturn system. It transmits the image of Saturn and its ring system and its satellite in high resolution. The surface appearance of the satellites can be seen for the first time.

It took at least 29.5 years for Saturn to complete a whole series of ecliptics with the background of the zodiac constellations. Most people would need optical help (such as huge binoculars or small telescopes) which could expand objects at least 30 times their original size to get the image of Saturn's ring system with a clear resolution. When the Earth crosses the field of Saturn rings, which occurs twice every year Saturn (about every 15 years of Earth), it disappears instantly from sight because the ring is very thin. A phenomenon like this will happen again in 2025, but Saturn is too close to the Sun to observe. Saturn and its ring system are best observed when the planet is at or close to opposition, a condition when a planet reaches a 180\u00b0 angle, so the planet will be visible on opposite sides of the Sun in the sky. Saturn's opposition will occur every year (about every 378 days) and by this time Saturn will look very bright. Because the Earth and Saturn orbit the Sun in an eccentric orbit, the distance between these two planets from the Sun varies over time, as well as the distance of these two planets to each other, so Saturn's brightness also varies in each opposition.

In valence bonds theory, azidas can be explained by some resonance structures and most important is N-=N+=N-. Azida is also a functional group in organic chemistry, RN3. The main use of azida is as a thrusters in the air sac. The main source of the zida functional group is sodium azida. Industrially, sodium azida is produced through nitrogen oxide reaction, N2O, with sodium amida, NaNH2 in liquid ammonia that acts as a solvent. The above reaction's stiometry is: Most organic or inorganic azidas are directly or indirectly produced by sodium azidas. For example, the lead azida used in explosives can be preparated from a metathesic reaction between lead nitrate and sodium azida. As a pseudohalogen compound, sodium azida generally replaces the appropriate group (for example, Br, I, OTs) to provide the azida compound. Azida salt can be unraveled with the release of nitrogen gas as discussed in the Application. The decomposition temperature of the alkali metal azida is: NaN3 (275 \u00b0C), KN3 (355 \u00b0C), RbN3 (395 \u00b0C), and CsN3 (390 \u00b0C). This method is used to produce pure ultra alkaline metals. Azida salt protonation produces toxic hydrazoic acid in strong acid presence: Many azidas of anorganic covalents (for example, chlorine, brominic, and iodine azida) have been explained. Organic azida is involved in useful organic reactions. Nitrogen terminal is rather nuclei. Ashida can easily exorcise diatomic nitrogen, a tendency to be exploited in a variety of reactions such as Staudinger ligaries or Curtius reorganizations or for example in the synthesis of the ester-imino-mbino-sixino.

This format came from a previous videocassette format, U-matic, 3/4-inch width (19.05 millimeters). Like video tapes like VHS produced by JVC in 1976, Betamax didn't have a safety tape, and used azimuth record to reduce scratches. The Betamax word comes from two words, Beta is the word for a signal line recorded on a tape, because the tape rotates through a transport that is shaped like the Greek alphabet \"Beta\" (Beta). The word -max comes from \"maximum\" which means incredible. Two cut cameras/systems of a fast VCR super refugee 8 mm film as the media of choice to shoot home movies and amateur movies.

The superior image Beta is essential to home movies, while the longer recording time VHS is viewed as excessive. However, consumers want a one-piece solution. The first part of the camcorder consumer Betamovie came from Sony. A primary requirement for a one-piece camcorder is the miniaturization of drum head, and Sony's solution to this involves an unstandard video signal that will be standard only when restarted on a full-size VCR.

And if the rental movies aren't available at Beta, they can hire them in VHS and use their camcorder to play them. The owner of VCR VHS can also select a variant camcorder format called VHS-C.

This movement was named after the French reformer John Calvin. Sometimes the variant of Protestant Christianity is called Reformed theology. Others refer to it as Hervormd theology, Hervormd's faith, or traditionalist Hervormd. Reformed theology was developed by theologys such as Martin Bucer, Heinrich Bulllinger, Peter Martyr Vermigli, and Huldrych Zwingli and also influenced by British reformers such as Thomas Cranmer and John Jewel. But because of the great influence of John Calvin and his role in confessional and ecclesiastical debates throughout the 17th century, this tradition came to be known generally as Calvinism. Now, this term also refers to the doctrine and practice of the Reformed Church, with Calvin as one of its first leaders, and this system was best known for predestination doctrines and total destruction.-45. The international influence of John Calvin in the development of Protestant Reformation doctrines began when he was 25 years old, when he began to write his first edition of the Instituteio: Christian teaching in 1534 (bited in 1536). This work experienced a number of revisions in its lifetime, including impressive translations into everyday French. Through the Institute of Institution along with the polymics and Calvin shepherding work, its contributions to confederate documents to be used in churches, and its vast contributions in the form of Biblical interpretations, Calvin had a great personal influence on Protestantism. He was just one of many others who influenced the doctrines of Reformed churches, although he eventually became the foremost.

From the beginning it was clear that the doctrines of Reformed churches developed in a free direction from Luther, under a number of authors and reformers, including Calvin who would become very prominent. Far later, when its fame is linked to the Churches Reformed, the whole collection of teachings is then referred to as \"Calvinism.\" Although much of Calvin's practice was done in Geneva, it spread its ideas about reformed churches to many parts of Europe. Calvinism became a theological system of the majority of Scotland (see John Knox), Holland, and parts of Germany (specially Dutch neighbors) as well as France, Hungary, Transylvania who were then independent, and Poland. Calvinism was popular in Scandinavia, especially Sweden, but was then rejected after the Uppsala synod in 1593 preferred Lutheranism. Most settlers in the Central Atlantic and New England, U.S.A., were Calvinists, including Puritans and French Huguenots and Dutch settlers in New Amsterdam (New York). Dutch Calvinists were also the first successful European colonists in South Africa, starting in the 17th century. They came to be known as either Boer or African people. Most of Sierra Leone is inhabited by Calvinists from Nova Scotia, which is mainly black loyalists, black people who fought for Britain during the American War of Independence.

In higher organisms, the eye is a complex optical system that collects light from its environment, regulates its intensity through diaphragm, focuses through the calibration of the lens to form an image, converts the image into one array of electrical signals, and transmits signals to the brain through complex neural pathways that connect the eye through the optic nerve to the visual cortex and other areas of the brain. The eye with its resolution powers has ten fundamentally different forms, and 96% of animal species have complex optic systems. These complex eyes are capable of forming images, such as in molluscs, cordatas, and artropods. The simplest \"eyes\", as in microorganisms, do nothing, but can detect whether the environment around it is bright or dark, which is enough for a circdian rhyming. From a more complex eye, the retinal photosensitive ganglion cell sends signals along the retinohipotalamic channel to the suprakiasmatic core for the effect of circdian adjustments and to the pretectal region to control the pulmonary rays reflex. The complex eye can distinguish shapes and colors. The field of vision in many organisms, particularly predators, binocular vision involves vast areas of area to increase depth perception. In other organisms, the eye lies in such a way that it maximizes the field of view, as in rabbits and horses, which have a monocular vision. The first prototype among animals evolved 600 million years ago around the Cambrian explosion. The last ancestors of animals had the biochemical devices necessary for vision, and the more advanced eyes developed at 96% of animal species on the six of the ~35a] main filum.

The eye is usually shaped like a ball, filled with a transparent gel called a clear body, with a focused lens and often with a rainbow membrane; a relaxation or contraction of the muscles around the rainbow membrane changes the size of the pupil, so it regulates the amount of light that goes into the eye, and reduces the aberration when there is sufficient light. The eyes on most of the sefolopods, fish, amphibians, and snakes have a fixed lens shape, and focus on the vision obtained by the telescope's lens is similar to the way the camera focuses. The compound eye is found on the artropode and consists of many simple facets that, depending on the details of anatomy, can give both a single and a few images per eye. Each sensor has its own lens and photosensitive cell. Some eyes have up to 28,000 sensors, which are hexagonally regulated, and can provide a full 360\u00b0 vision field. Compound eyes are very sensitive to movement. Some artropodes, including many strepsipteras, have compound eyes of just a few phases, each with retinas capable of making images, creating visions. With each eye seeing something different, the image merges from all eyes and produces a very different and high resolution image inside the brain. Having hyperspectral vision detail, centadules have been reported to have the most complex color vision system in the world. Trilobytes, now extinct, have unique compound eyes.

Some insect larvae, such as caterpillars, have a variety of simple eyes that give rough pictures. Some simple eyes, called osselus, can be found in animals like some species of snails, which are not really \"seeing\" in a normal sense. This snail has photosensitive cells, but it doesn't have lenses and there's no other way to project images into these cells. Snails can distinguish between light and darkness, but nothing more.

There are ten types of eye arrays, even every technology method to capture images of optics commonly used by humans, with the exception of variable lenses and Fresnel lenses, found in nature. The types of eyes can be categorized into a \"simple eye,\" with one photoreceptive concave surface, and a \"gamic eye,\" which consists of a number of individual lenses placed on a convex surface. Notice that \"simple\" doesn't mean a decline in complexity or acuity. Granted, any type of eye can be adjusted to virtually any behavior or environment.

These two groups are not monofiletic; cnidarias also have cylia cells, and some annelides have both. The existence of simple eyes is quite widespread and the bearings of eye lenses have evolved at least seven times on vertebrates, seflopods, annelides, crustaceans, and cubozoa. The niche eye, also known as the stemma, is an eyespot set into the hole to reduce the angles of light that enter and affect eye spots, enabling organisms to conclude the angles of light that enter.

Mura has developed a hole that acts as an eye by indrading infrared thermal radiation, besides its optical wavelengths like other vertebrates. The resolution of the niche can be greatly improved by combining materials that have a higher bias index to form a lens, which may greatly reduce the escape radius that he faced because it increased the resolution that was obtained. The most basic form, seen in some species of gastropods and annelides, consists of a lens with one bias index. A much sharper image can be obtained by using a high - bias index that drops around the edges, aims to reduce the length of focus and thus allow sharp images to form on the retina.",

Heterogen eyes have evolved at least nine times, four times or more in gastropods, once in copepods, once in annelide, once in squids, and once in kitons, which have aragonite lenses. No water organism still has a homogeneous lens, perhaps the evolutionary pressure for a heterogenous lens is large enough so that this stage becomes rapid \"talatation.\" These eyes create a fairly sharp image, but eye movements can cause significant blurs. To minimize the effect of eye movements when animals move, most of the eyes have stabilized the muscles of their eyes. The insect oselus has a simple lens, but its focal point always lies behind the retina; the result is that the eye can never form a sharp image. The osselus obscures images throughout the retina, and therefore responds to rapid changes in the intensity of light in the whole field. This rapid response is even more accelerated by large neural files, which transmit information to the brain. Focusing on images will also cause the sun's image to focus on some receptors, with possible damage under intense light exposure; protecting receptors will block the light and thereby reduce sensitivity. This rapid response has led to indications that insect osselus is used primarily in flight, since osselus can be used to detect sudden light changes (because light, especially ultraviolet light absorbed by vegetation, usually coming from above).",

Some lenses are visible in some hunting animals like eagles and jumper spiders, having reflective corneas (next talk): this structure has a negative lens, zooming in on the 50 percent observed image on the receptor cell, thus increasing optical resolution. In most mammals' eyes, birds, reptiles, and most other land vertebrates (together with spiders and some insect larvae), clear fluid has an index of bias higher than the air. In general, lenses aren't spherical. The spherical lens produces aferic aberration. In a reflective cornea, the lens tissue is corrected with a nonhomogen lens material (see the Luneburg lens), or in a nonsferic form. The flat lens has a weakness, which is that the quality of vision decreases on the main axis of focus. Thus, animals that have evolved with a broad field of sight often have eyes that use a gahomogen lens. As noted above, the cornea reflective is only useful outside the water. In water, there is a slight difference in the bias index between the clear fluid and the water around it. Hence, animals that have returned into the water the penguin and the walruses lose a very curved cornea and return to a vision - based lens. The alternative solution that some divers have is to have a cornea that is able to focus very strongly.

Some larger organisms, such as capis, also use reflective eyes. The Pecten capis has 100 reflective eyes per millimeter down the edge of its shell. This structure can detect moving objects through successive lenses. There is at least one vertebrata, Dolichopteryx longipes, whose eyes include reflective optics to focus light. Each of the two eyes on a Dolichopteryx longipes collects light from above and below. The light coming from above is focused on the lens, while the light coming from below is focused on a curved mirror consisting of many layers of reflective little plates made of guarnin crystals. A compound eye can consist of thousands of individual photoreceptors or omaticia (omaticium, single). The perceived image is a combination of various omatidia (the individual eye unit) which is located on the convex surface, so each omaticium points in a slightly different direction. Compared with simple eyes, the compound eye has a very large point of view, can detect fast movements, and in some cases it can detect polarization of light. Because individual lenses are very small, the effects of diffraction impose limits on possible accessable resolutions (in the assumption that compound eyes do not function as a phased arrangement). It can only be overcome by increasing the size and number of lenses.

Compound eyes, at least on the artropods, grow with new omatic additions to the edge. The apository eye is the most common form of the eye, and it may also be the form of the compound eye's ancestor. These eyes were found throughout the group, although the eye may have evolved more than once in this filum. Some annelides and bivalves also have eye dispositions. These eyes are also owned by Limulus, horseshoe crabs, and there are indications that another chelicerata develops a simple eye by reducing the compound starting point (some caterpillars seem to have developed a compound eye from a simple eye in the opposite way). The apository eye works by gathering a number of images, one from each eye, and combining them in the brain, with each eye usually contributes one point of information. The uniqueity that the apositary eye has is the lens that concentrates light from one direction in rabdom, while light from another is absorbed by the dark wall of the omaticium. Superposition eyes are divided into three types, which is: superpositional eyes refraction, reflective, and parabolic. The superposition of the eye has a gap between the lens and the rabdom, and it has no sidewall. Each lens takes a light at a certain angle to the lens axis and reflects it with the same size angle on the other side. The result is an image at half an eye radius, that's where the tip of Rabdom is.

This type of eye works by refracting light, then using parabola mirrors to focus the image, combining the properties of the eye in position and superposition. Another kind of compound eye, found in the male order Strepsiptera, uses a simple set of eyes with one crack gives light to the retina's overall image. Some of these holes together form a compound-eyed strepsipteran, similar to the compound eye of the 'skizokroal' of some trilobytes. Since each eye is a simple eye, these eyes will produce an upside-down image. It's combined in the brain to form a unified image. Because openings are larger than compound eyes, they allow for vision at a low level of light. Flyers are either like flies or honeybees, or prey-eating insects such as Sendadu or dragonfly locusts, having omatidia with specialized zones arranged into a fovea region that gives sharp vision. In this keen region of vision, the eyes are flattened and the facet is larger. The alignment allows more omaticia to receive light from somewhere and therefore has a higher resolution.

This structure projectes a perpendicular image on a specialized retina. The resulting eye is a simple combination of eyes in the compound eye. Another version is the pseudophaset eye, just like the Scutigera. This type of eye consists of an osselous group on each side of the head, set in such a way that it resembles a true compound eye. The body of Ophiocoma wendtii, a type of Ophiuroidea, covered in omaticia, turned its whole skin into a compound eye. The same applies to a lot of kilotons. The foot of the pig's fur tube contains a photoreceptor protein, which together acts as a compound eye. This structure has very little pigment filtering, but it can detect the light direction of the shadow given by the body. Photoreceptors are filogenetically old, with a variety of filogenesis theories. The common origin of all animal eyes is now widely accepted as a fact. It's based on the collective genetic characteristics of all eyes. That is, all modern eyes, varied as they used to be, their origins came from a protomy that was believed to have evolved some 540 million years ago, and the PAX6 gene was considered a key factor in this.

The eyes on various animals indicate adaptation to their needs. For example, a predator's eye has a sharper eyesight than that of a human eye, and in some cases it can detect ultraviolet radiation. Different eye shapes, for example, are examples of parallel evolution, regardless of their distant ancestors. The phenotipic convergence of the sefalopod geometry and most of the vertebrates' eyes create the impression that the vertebrates' eyes evolved from seflopod imaging, but unlike that, the cylary role and the rabdomeric class of the two upside-down animals, and they had a different crystal lens. The earliest \"eyes,\" called eye spots, are a simple set of photoreceptors proteins in uniseluler animals. In multicellular organisms, multicellular eye spots evolved, physically similar to a collection of tasters and embers. These eyes can only sense the brightness around them, distinguish light and darkness, but not the direction of the source of light. Through gradual changes, the eyespots of the species that live in the bright environment are depressed to form a concave that is not deep, thus having little ability to distinguish directional brightness from what is gained by using the angle of light that hits certain cells to identify the source. The hole that is deepened from time to time, the size of the opening is reduced, and the number of photoreceptors is increasing, forming an effective pinhole camera capable of faintly distinguishing a form.

This transparent protective cell eventually divides into two layers, with fluid circulation between which allows for a wider perspective and greater imaging resolution, and the thickness of the transparent layer increases gradually, in most species with transparent crystalline proteins. The gap between the network layers naturally formed biconvex, the ideal structure to optimally obtain the normal bias index. Independently, a transparent layer and a separate nontransparent layer of the lens form corneas and irises. Then, the resurgence of the layer forms humor, front porch. This humor is able to increase reflective power and reduce blood circulation problems. The formation of nontransparent rings enables more blood vessels, more circulation, and greater eye sizes. The eyes generally adapt to the necessities of life of the organism and the environment it bears. For example, the distribution of photoreceptors tends to match areas that require high sharpness, with horizontal scanner organisms, such as living organisms in the African plains, with horizontal ganglia lines with high density, whereas living organisms in need of good vision tend to have symmetrical ganglia distribution, with sharpness decreasing as they get farther away from the center.

The eye of the horizontal scanner organism has a stalk so that it can easily be synced with the horizon when it is on its side, for example, if it is on the slopes. The extension of the concept is that predator's eyes usually have very sharp vision zones at the center, to help identify prey. In deep water organisms, it may not be the center of the eye that expands. The amphipod hyperidea are deep - water animals that feed on the organisms above them. Their eyes were almost split in two, with the upper part thought to be involved in detecting a syllie of potential prey or predatory among the faint skylights above it. Thus, hyperidea in deeper waters, by comparison between light and the shadow of the syllautes is difficult to distinguish, it has a larger \"upside eye,\" and it may lose its lower eye. Perception of depth can be enhanced by having an eye that expands in one direction, slightly distorting the eye allowing the distance of an object to be estimated with a high degree of accuracy. Higher sharpness is owned by male organisms that mate in the air, since these male organisms must be able to recognize and assess prospective mates in a very large background.

Acuity of vision, or separation, is \"the ability to distinguish fine detail\" and is the nature of the cone cell. Visibility is often measured in cycles per degree, measuring angle resolution, or how far the eye can distinguish one object from another from the angle of vision. Resolution in cycles per degree can be measured using a bar chart with a difference in the number of cycles of white/black lines. For example, if each pattern had a width of 1.75 centimeters and placed at a distance of 1 m from the eye, it would form an angle of 1 degree, so the number of white/blackline pairs in the pattern would be the size of the cycle per degree of that pattern. The highest numbers that the eye can see as separate lines, or what distinguishes from the gray block, are the measurements of vision sharpness. For the human eye with excellent sharpness, the maximum theoretic resolution is 50 cycles per degree (1.2 minutes of bow per line, or 0.35 mm line at 1 m). A rat can only separate about 1 to 2 cycles per degree. A horse has a higher sharpness through most of its field of sight than humans do, but it is not similar to the sharpness of the fovea area at the center of the human eye. Spherical accuracy limits the resolution of the pupil's 7 mm diameter to about 3 minutes per line bow.",

        "paragraph": "In a 3 mm diameter pupil, spherical aberrations are greatly reduced, increasing resolution by about 1.7 minutes per line bow. The 2-minute resolution of a bow per pair of lines is equal to a one-minute arc in an optotype, which corresponds to 20/20 (normal view) in a human. However, the resolution to the compound eye is related to the size of a single omaticia and the distance between adjacent omaticia. Physically the size of omaticia cannot be reduced to achieve the sharpness of what is seen with a single-lensed eye in mammals. The compound eye has a much lower sharpness than the vertebrate eye. Color vision is the organism's ability to distinguish light from different spectral qualities. All organisms are limited to a narrow range of electromagnetic spectrums, varied between living things, but most are able to see wavelengths between 400 and 700 nm. This range is a small part of the electromagnetic spectrum, perhaps reflecting the evolutionary organs of underwater organisms: the water is blocking all but two small windows of electromagnetic spectrum, and there is no evolutionary pressure on land animals to expand this range. The most sensitive Pygment, the rodopsin, has a peak response at 500 nm. A little change in the genes that encode this protein can change the peak response of some nm. The pigments on the lens can also filter in light and change the peak response. Many organisms cannot distinguish color, see gray, which suggests color vision requires a variety of pigment cells that are especially sensitive to a smaller spectrum span. In primates, Geckos, and other organisms, these pigment cells form cones, which are then more sensitive stem cells evolved from this cell. In fact, if organisms are physically able to distinguish different colors, this does not mean that they can sense different colors, just by testing behavior can be concluded.",

With a few exceptions (ulars and pigmented mammals), most organisms avoid this effect by having a drip of absorbing oil around their cones. Alternatively, the organism that has lost its droplets in its evolutionary journey makes a lens that is resistant to ultraviolet light, preventing the possibility of a detected ultraviolet light from reaching the retina. The retina has two types of light - sensitive major photoreceptors and is used for vision: stem cells and cones. The stem cells cannot distinguish colors, but they are responsible for seeing a low light (scotopic) monochrome (white black). Stem cells work well on dim light because they contain pigment, rodopsin, which is sensitive to low light intensity, but are saturated with higher intensity. Stem cells spread throughout the retina except fovea and blind spots. The density of stem cells is greater in the peripheral retina than in the central retina. Conical cells are responsible for color vision. It needs a brighter light to function compared with the light that stem cells need. In humans, there are three kinds of cones, which are: cones that are very sensitive to long wavelengths, medium wavelengths, and short wavelengths (frequently referred to as red, green and blue in sequence, although their sensitivity peaks are not really in this color). The visible color is the combined stimulus effect and the response of these three kinds of cones. Conical cells are mostly concentrated on and near the fovea. Few are found on the side of the retina. The object looks sharpest in focus when the image falls on the fovea, like when one sees an object directly.",

When rods and cones are stimulated by light, they're both connected through adjacent cells inside the retina to send electrical signals to the optic nerve fibers. Optic nerves transmit impulses through these nerve fibers to the brain. The pigment molecules used by the eye vary, but these differences can be used to determine the evolutionary distance between the different groups, and they can also be a aid in determining which groups are closely linked to the possibility of convergence. Options are pigments involved in photoreception. Other pigmen, such as melanin, are used to protect photoreceptors from light that escapes from the side. An optional protein group evolved long before the last ancestor of animals, and has continued to be diversified ever since. There are two types of options involved in vision, which is c-opsion associated with cylian photoreceptors cells and r-options associated with photoreceptors rabdomer cells. Vertebrata eyes usually contain ciliates with c-options and invertebrate eyes (whenterial) cells have r-optone rabdomer cells. However, some ganglion vertebrates express r-options, indicating that the ancestors of the vertebrates used these pigments in vision, and the remains survived in the eye. Likewise, it has been discovered that c-options are expressed in the brain of some invertebrates. This C-option may have been expressed by cell silias in the larval eye, which was then absorbed into the brain in metamorphosis into adult form. C-opsions are also found in some invertebrate eyes when the event is passed down, such as the palium eye of the bivalve mollus, but the lateral eye (which may be the ancestral type for this group, if the eye evolves once) always uses r-option. Cnidaria, which is an outside group of the planets mentioned above, expresses c-options but r-options have not yet been found within this group.",

During World War II, these sources were used to fill the empty supply of rubber from the para. Today, the perca sap is used in medicine (gultapercha), while the sawo manila latex is used for chewing gum (chicles). The industrial rubber can now be produced synthetically and competed in the drag industry. Rubber is a polymer of polyprena units arranged from 5000 to 10,000 units in a branchless chain. Allegedly, the first three ties are trans and the next cis. This compound is contained in the latex of its tree. At normal temperatures, rubbers are not shaped. At low temperatures he will crystallize. With temperatures rising, the rubber will expand, in the direction of its long axis. The drop in temperature will bring back this inflated state.

The smallest is an undan chocolate (Pelecanus occidentalis) with a mass of just 2.75 kg, 680 inches [1.83 m] and the maximum wing width of 1.83 m.. The largest of these is un and valestia (Pelecanus crispus) with a mass of 15 kg and 183 cm long, with a wingspan of up to 3.5 m. Un and australia have the longest beaks among the other birds. Pelicans are good swimmers, with their short, strong webbed legs. Microbial food is usually fish, but they also eat amphibians, crustaceans, and in some cases, small birds. They catch their prey by zooming in on their beak sacs. Then they have to dry the pockets before they swallow. This takes one minute, and other seabirds can steal the fish at that critical time. Pelicans sometimes steal prey from other seabirds. White Pelicans catch fish in groups. They form a line to chase a bunch of small fish into shallow waters, sweeping the fish with their beaks. The big fish are caught with the tip of the beak, then thrown into the air to be recaptured and into their beak sacs with their heads first. North American Chocolate Pelicans usually dive in to catch their prey. And in rare cases, other species such as Pelican Peru and Pelican Australia perform that method of hunting.",

Research in nutrition studies the relationship between food and drink to health and disease, especially in determining the optimal diet. In the past, research on nutrition was limited to the prevention of malnourished disease and determined the basic necessities of nutrients in living things. The number of basic nutrition needs is known in the international world as Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA). Along with scientific developments in medical and molecular biology, medical evidence shows that RDA is not enough to maintain the body's optimum function and prevent or help with chronic illness. Medical evidence suggests that the root of many chronic diseases is the oxidative stress caused by the excess of free radicals in the body. The optimal use of nutrients, known as Optimal Daily Allowance (ODA), has proved to prevent and treat oxidative stress and thus help prevent chronic disease. This optimal level can be achieved when the amount and composition of nutrients are used precisely. In treatment of disease, the use of nutrition as a complementary treatment can help the effectiveness of treatment and at the same time cope with side effects of treatment. Hence, nutrition / nutrition is closely linked to optimal health and improved quality of life. The measurements can be done by means of anthropometry. And Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise.

That is how Allah explains His Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.). DNA replication processes can also be performed in vitro in a process called polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Replication forks or replication branches (replication forks) are structures that form when DNA replicates. This replication fork is formed by the helicase enzyme that severs the hydrogen bonds that unite the two strands of DNA, opening the strands into two branches that each consist of a single strand of DNA. Each of these branches becomes a \"print\" for the formation of two new strands of DNA based on its complementary sequence of nucleotides. The polymerase DNA forms a new strand of DNA by extending the oligonucleotide formed by a prime enzyme called primary. The polymerase DNA forms a new strand of DNA by adding nucleotides to this, deoxyribonucleotides to the end of 3'-hrorksil' free nucleotide chains of DNA that are growing. In other words, the new DNA chain is synthesized from the direction of 5'\u21923', while the polymerase DNA moves on the DNA \"induction\" in 3'\u21925'. Nevertheless, one of the mother DNA strands on the 3'\u21925-oriented replication fork, while the other strands are 5' \u21923', and the helicase is moving to open the strand of the DNA frame at 5'\u21923'. Therefore, replications must take place in both opposing directions. In DNA replication, early strands (leading strains) are strands of DNA synthesized in the direction of 5'\u21923' continuously. In this strand, the polymerase DNA is able to form the DNA using the 3'-OH edges free from a primary RNA and DNA synthesis continuing, in the direction of the replication fork movement.",

These strands are synthesized in segments called Okazaki fragments. In this strand, primase forms a primary RNA. The polymerase DNA could thus use OH 3' free on the primary RNA to synthesize DNA at 5'\u21923'. The primary fragments of RNA were then removed (e.g. with RNase H and Polymerase I) and new deoxyribonucleotide were added to fill the gaps formerly occupied by RNA. The ligature DNA then connects the Okazaki fragments so that the synthesis lagging strain becomes complete. The evidence found recently suggests that the enzymes and proteins involved in DNA replication remain on the replication fork while DNA forms a dune to maintain the formation of DNA in both directions. This is a result of interaction between polymerase DNA, sliding clamp, and clamp loader. Sliding clamp on all types of living things has a similar structure and is able to interact with the different processes and non-processive DNA found in the cells. In addition, the sliding clamp serves as a factor in the processes. C-end-sliding clamp forms a surge capable of interacting with other protein-proteins that are involved in DNA replication (such as polymerase DNA and clamp loader). The inside of the sliding clamp allows the DNA to move through it. Sliding clamp doesn't form specific interactions with DNA. There's a huge 35A hole in the middle of this clamp. The hole is the right size for DNA to pass through and water to occupy the rest so that the clamp can shift along DNA. Once the polymerase reaches the edge of the template or detects multiple strands of DNA (see below), the sliding clamp undergoes a change of conformation that releases polymerase DNA.",

With ATP hydrolysis, the clamp loader is released from the sliding clamp so the polymerase DNA attaches to the sliding clamp. Sliding clamp can only bond to polymerase during the synthesis of a single strand of DNA. If the single chain DNA is exhausted, the polymerase is able to bond with the subunit on the clamp loader and move into a new position on lagging strain. On leading strain, the DNA polymerase III joins the clamp loader and binds with the sliding clamp. The replication of the DNA of procariota chromosomes, especially bacteria, is closely related to its growth cycle. The ori region of E. coli, for example, contains four binders of the DNAA proteins, each of which are nine pbs long. This DNA protein synthesis is compatible with the rate of bacteria growth so that replication initiation is also consistent with the rate of bacteria growth. At a very high rate of cell growth; the DNA of the procariota chromosome can reinitiate replication on two newly formed ori before the first round of replication ends. As a result, cells of division will receive chromosomes that have partially replicated. DNAA proteins form complex structures made up of 30 to 40 molecules, each of which will bind to ATP molecules. The ori area will surround the DNAA-ATP complex. This process requires the condition of the DNA's supercoiling negative. The negative supercoiling will cause the opening of 13 pb-rich 13 pb-lengths of the AT so that it allows the binder of the DnaB protein, which is the helicase enzyme, the enzyme that will use the ATP energy hydrolysis to move along the two strands of DNA and separate them. A single strand of DNA resulting from helicase is then covered by a single strand or single-stranded protein binding (Ssb) protein to protect a single strand of DNA from physical damage and prevent reorganization.",

In order for replication to continue running away from ori, the helicase enzyme is needed besides DNA. This is because the opening of the helix will be followed by the formation of a new round of positive supercoiling. The negative supercoiling that occurs naturally turns out not enough to compensate for it so it needs another enzyme, which is a topoisomerase type II called girase DNA. This fluid DNA enzyme is the target of an antibiotic attack so that antibiotics can prevent the continued replication of bacteria DNA. As noted above, DNA replication occurs both on the driver's strand and on the left strand. In the trailing strand of a complex called primosome will synthesize a number of primary RNAs at an interval of 1,000 to 2,000 bases. Primosom is made up of DNAB helicase and primase DNA. Primary of both the driver's strand and the strand left behind will be exposed with the help of holoenzim DNA polymerase III. The multisubunit complex is a dime, and half will work on the driver's strand, and the other half will work on the strands left behind. Thus, the synthesis on both strands will travel at the same speed. Each part of the dime in the two strands consists of a subunit, which has an actual polymerase function, and an e subunit, which has editing functions of 3 exonucleases. In addition, there is a B subunit that attaches polymerase to DNA. Once the primary strands are longered by the polymerase III DNA, they will soon be removed and the gap caused by the primary loss is filled by the polymerase I DNA, which has a polymerase activity of 5 JUNI3, exonuclease 5 JULI 3, and exonucleage editing 3 JUNE 5 JUNE.",

With a replication DNA synthesis going at 900 pb every second. Both replication forks will meet roughly at the position of 180 \u00b0C of the ori. Around this area are a number of Terminators that will stop the prong movements of replication forks. The Terminator includes the product of the gene tus, an inhibitor for the DNAB helicase. When replication is complete, both circles of replication still merge. Separation is carried out by the topoisomerase IV enzyme. Each of these circles is replication and then segregated into both cells of cleavage. In eukaryota, DNA replication occurs only in S phases in interphase. To enter S phase requires regulation by a complex protein system called cyclone and cyclin-dependent protein (CDKs), which will be activated in a row by a growth signal that reaches the surface of the cell. Some CDKs will do phosphorylation and activate the proteins necessary for initiation on each ori. In relation to the complexity of the chromatin structure, the replication fork on the eukaryota moves at only 50 pbs per second. Before copying, DNA must be released from nucleosom on a replication fork so that the replication fork movement will be slowed down to about 50 pbs per second.

Next, three different polymerase DNAs are involved in elongasi. The strand of the driver and each of the strand fragments left behind is initialized by the primary RNA with the help of prime activity which is an integral part of a polymerase DNA enzyme. This enzyme will continue to replicate but then immediately be replaced by polymerase d DNA on the directorial strand and DNA polymerase e on the camel left behind. Both the DNA of polymerase d and e have editing functions. The capacity for polymerase d DNA to synthesize long DNA is due to the presence of an antigen prologue of cells or proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), which functions equivalent to the subunit b holoenzim DNA polymerase III on E. coli.

Bacteria are one of the first life-forms to emerge and currently inhabit most of the habitats on Earth. Bacteria can live on soil, water, acidic hot springs, radioactive waste, up to the Earth's crust. Bacteria also form a symbiotic relationship with plants and animals. Most bacteria are not known for their character, and only about 27 percent of bacteria filum have species that can be grown in labs.

Almost all animals depend on bacteria so they can survive because only bacteria and a number of archea have the genes and enzymes necessary to synthesize vitamin B12. This vitamin is obtained by animals through the food chain or is produced by microorganisms that live in their digestive system. There are about 40 million bacterial cells in one gram of soil and one million bacterial cells in a milliliter of fresh water.

The most common source of deadly bacterial diseases are respiratory infections. Tuberculosis kills about two million people a year, most of which occur in sub-Saharan Africa. Antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections and are also used in agriculture, which makes antibiotic resistance an ongoing problem.

Cohn also initializes bacteria by form (rounds, rods, filaments, and spirals) and develops some methods to prevent contamination of bacterial culture, such as the use of cotton as a cover on test tubes. Louis Pasteur, a French chemist, discovered that warming can kill or disable bacteria and other microorganisms in wine so that the wine is not easily damaged and has a longer life savings. This method is then called pasteurization. In 1859 to 1864, Pasteur denied the concept of spontaneous formation through his experiments that were then widely accepted. With his contemporary Robert Koch, Pasteur was an early supporter of the germ theory of disease. At the time, microorganisms were known to cause infectious diseases. Yet, there was no definitive evidence to support this theory until Robert Koch, a German doctor, managed to isolate and reproduce pure bacteria, and grow them in the laboratory. Bacllus anthropes and Mycobacterium tuberculosis were bacteria used by Koch to prove the germ theory of disease until he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1905.

A major development in bacterology occurred in 1977 when Carl Woese published that the archea had an evolutionary line separated from the bacteria. This filogentic taxonomy depends on the sort of RNA ribosomal 16S and divides procariota into two domains, as part of the three domain system. The ancestors of today's bacteria are the unicellular microorganisms that were the first life forms on Earth about 4 billion years ago. For some 3 billion years, the majority of organisms of microscopic size, dominated by bacteria and archea. Although fossil bacteria are found, for example, in the form of stromatolit, their less typical morphological form causes them to be unable to be used to determine the history of bacterial evolution or the timing of certain species of bacteria. Nevertheless, gene sequences can be used to reconstruct bacteria filogeny, indicating that bacteria first formed a branch and came out of an archea/eukariot bloodline. The most recent common ancestor of bacteria and archeaics may have been hyperthermophyils that lived about 2.5 to 3.2 billion years ago. The earliest life-forms on land may have been bacteria that lived some 3.22 billion years ago. Bacteria are also involved in a second large evolutionary divergence that creates a branch of archea and eukaryota. At that time, eukariota was formed from the entry of ancient bacteria into the ancestors of eukaryota cells (which may still be closely related to the archea) through the endosymbiotic association. More specifically, proto-eukariot cells \u25aarespond the Alphaprotobacteria as symbiones so as to form one of the mitochondria or hydrogenosom, which is still found in all known eukaryota cells (sometimes in very induced forms, for example, in ancient protozoa without mitochondria).",

This is known as primary endombiosis. One group of bacteria, phenobacterial or \"blue green algae,\" has left the fossils far away from the Prakambrium period. The oldest known fossil cyanobacteria to date is nearly 3.5 billion years old. Saanobacterial is larger than bacteria in general, and it can remove thick cell walls. In addition, it can also form a large layered structure, called the stromatolit (the shape of a dome) or an onkolit (when round). This structure is formed as a phenobacterial base growing in the acumatic environment, forming sediments and sometimes releasing calcium carbonates. When cut so thin, phanobacterial and well - preserved fossil algae can be found in fossil stromatolits. Apart from the phanobacterial, there aren't many fossils of bacteria published. Under certain conditions, bacterial cells can be misunderstood by minerals, especially with pirites or siderits, minerals that can form replicas of living cells or pseudomorphs. Some bacteria also remove iron - coated sheaths that sometimes fossilize. There are also bacteria that enter the shell or rock and form microscopic channels inside the shell; the bacteria are referred to as endolitics. Bacteria have also been found in tree resins, fossils, and in mummy tissues. Bacteria have various shapes and sizes. Bacteria cells are about a tenth of the eukaryota cells and are usually between 0.5 and 5 micrometers. However, some species can be seen with the naked eye, such as the .7 - mm Thiomargarita namibiensis. The smallest sample bacteria are members of the Mycoplasma genus of 0.3 micrometers, roughly the size of the largest virus.",

Most species of bacteria are round (called cocus; from the Greek k\u00f3kkos meaning grain or seed) or stem (called basilus, from the Latin baculus meaning stick). Some types of bacteria are shaped like stems that are somewhat curved or comma (called vibrio); other bacteria can be spiraled (called spirilllum) or circled tightly (called sprinklers). An unusual form has also been found, such as star - shaped bacteria. Various forms are determined by the walls of bacteria cells and cytoskeletons, which play an important role because they can influence the ability of bacteria to acquire nutrients, stick to the surface, swim in liquids, and escape predators. Many species of bacteria are only single cells, while other bacteria are grouped in a typical pattern: Neisseria is diploid, Streptococcus forms chains, while Staphyloccus clusters together resembles a bunch of grapes. Bacteria can also group together into larger multicellular structures, such as Actinobacteria with long filaments, micsobacterials that form agregats, and Streptomyces that have complex hifas. These multicellular structures are often seen only in certain conditions. For example, when the lack of amino acids, the microsobacterials detect the surrounding cells through a process known as the quarem sense to migrate toward each other and assemble to form fruit bodies for up to 500 micrometers and contain about 100,000 bacterial cells. In this fruit body, bacteria perform separate tasks; for example, about one out of ten cells migrate to the upper part of the fruit and vary into a special form of dorman called the mixospora that is more resistant to dry conditions and harmful environments.",

The thickness of the biofilm and mat is about a few micrometers while the depth can be up to half a meter, and may contain many species of bacteria, protistas, and archea. The bacteria that live in biomovies feature complex stem cells and extracellular components and form secondary structures, such as microcolonies, in which channel networks allow for better nutrition diffusion. In natural environments, such as soil or plant surfaces, most bacteria are bound in biofilm forms. Biomovies are important in medicine because these structures often appear when bacterial infections take place chronically or when infections occur in medical equipment implants. The bacteria protected in biofilm are far more difficult to kill than the bacteria that live alone. Bacteria cells are surrounded by cell membranes, which are mainly made of phospholipid. This membrane wraps up the contents of the cell and sets up a barrier for nutrients, proteins, and other important components in the cytoplasm to keep them inside the cell. Unlike eukaryota, bacterial cells usually don't have large membrane-wrapped structures inside their cytoplasm, such as nucleus, mitochondria, chloroplasts, and other organelles. Nevertheless, a number of bacteria have organelles that bond with proteins, for example carboxsisomes, which create compartments to separate aspects of bacteria metabolism. In addition, bacteria have multicomponent cytoskeletons to regulate the localization of proteins and nucleic acids inside the cell, as well as to manage the process of cell division. Many essential biochemical reactions, such as energy generation, occur because of a membrane cross concentration gradient. As a result, there is a potential difference similar to that of the battery. Generally speaking, the lack of internal membranes in bacteria causes these reactions, such as the electron transport chain, to cross the cell membrane, either between the cytoplasm (in the inside of the cell) with the outside of the cell or with the periplasm.",

This light - collecting complex can form a structure covered with lipid called chlorosome in green sulfur bacteria. Bacteria don't have a nucleus wrapped in membranes. Its genetic material is usually nucleoid, which is DNA located in the cytoplasm in irguler terms that form a single circular chromosome. Nukleoids contain chromosomes complete with protein structure and RNA. Like all other organisms, bacteria have ribosomes to produce proteins, but bacteria' ribosome structures differ from ribosomes in eukaryota and archea. A number of bacteria produce nutrient grains in their cells, such as glycogen, polyphosphate, sulfur, or alcanotic polydroction. Some bacteria, like phenobacterial photosynthetics, have internal gas vacuums that they use to regulate buoyancy so that they can move up or down in water laps that have different light intensity and different nutrients levels. The layer surrounding the outer membrane of the cell is the cell wall. The bacterial cell walls are made of peptidoglic (called murein), which are composed by polysacride chains that are cross-connected with peptides containing amino-D acids. The walls of bacterial cells are also different from archea that contain no peptidoglicans. For many bacteria, cell walls are essential to their survival because some substances, such as penicillin (antibiotic produced by Penicillium mold), are able to kill bacteria by blocking one step in the reaction synthesis of peptidoglition. Largely, there are two types of cell walls in bacteria, which group bacteria into Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria.",

Gram-positive bacteria have thick cell walls that contain many layers of peptidogligic and teikoic acid. Gram-negative bacteria, on the other hand, have a relatively thin cell wall made up of several layers of peptidoglis surrounded by lipida dwilayer membranes containing lipopoliskaraida and lipopolisrotein. Most bacteria have grum-negative cell walls, and only Firmicuses and Actinobacteria (previously known as Gram-positive bacteria with low G+C and high G+C) which have an alternative Gram-positive configuration. The difference between these structures can result in vulnerabilities to antibiotics; for example, vancomisin can only kill Gram-positive bacteria and not be effective against Gram-negative pathogens, such as Haemophilus influenzae or Pseudomonas aeposinosa. Some bacteria have a wall structure of cells that don't belong to Gram-positive or Gram-negative, including clinically important bacteria like Mycobacterium that have walls of cells with thick peptidoglis like Gram-postive bacteria, but also have a second layer of lipid on the outside. In many bacteria, the S-layer is a protein molecule that is rigidly arranged to cover the outer part of the cell. This layer protects the cell's surface physically and chemically and can act as a barrier to the diffusion of macromoleculum. The S-layer has different functions, but most of its functions are not understood. So far, the S-lay is known to act as a virulence factor in Campylobacter and contain surface enzymes on the Bacellus stearothphilus. Many bacteria have other extracelles such as flagella, fibbria, and pili that are used to move, stick, and conjugate. Flagella is a rigid protein structure used for motility. The flagella diameter is about 20 nanometers long and 20 micrometers long. Flagella is driven by energy released by ion transfers, which occur because of electrochemical gradients across cell membranes.",

They're scattered across the surface of the cell and they look like fine hair when observed through an electron microscope. Phymbria is believed to be involved in bacteria attaching themselves to solid surfaces or other cells, and it plays a role in some pathogenic virulence. In the meantime, pili is a complementary structure slightly larger than fibria. This structure is referred to as a conjugation pill or genital pill when it becomes a means of transferring genetic matter between bacteria in a process called conjugation (see the genetic bacteria below). They can also produce a movement called pili type IV. Many bacteria produce glycocalyx to surround their cells. The complexity of glycocalyx structures varies, ranging from an irregular mucus layer made from extracellular polymers to highly structured capsules. These structures can protect bacterial cells from eukaryota cells, such as macrophages, which are about to swallow them up. Glycocalyx also has several other roles: act as an antigen, engage in cell recognition, and help attach to a surface and form biofilms. Equipment of extracellular structures depends on the bacterial secretion system, which transfers proteins from cytoplasm to periplasm or to the environment around the cell. Scientists have discovered various bacterial secretion systems and have discovered that the extracellular structures it produces often play an important role in determining pathogenal virulence. Therefore, they are studied intensively. Some Gram-positive genus bacteria, such as Bacillus, Clostridium, Sporohalabacter, Anaerobacter, and Heliobaacterium, can form a very sustainable structure called endospora. Endospora thrives in cytoplasm and generally one endospora develops in each cell.",

Endospora shows no signs of metabolism and can survive physical and chemical stress, such as ultraviolet rays, pea radiation, germination, disinfectant, heat, clotting, pressure, and drying, at an extreme rate. In these inactive conditions, an organism can survive for millions of years, and the endospora even allow bacteria to survive in vacuum conditions and radiation in space so that bacteria may be distributed to the entire universe through cosmic dust, meteoroids, asteroids, comets, planetoids, or through directional panspermia. Endospora - forming bacteria can also cause disease. For example, anthrax can be transmitted by inhaling the endospora Baclus anthrax, while internal stabs contaminated with endospora Clostridium tetanis can cause tetanus. In addition, the endospora Clostridium botulinum provides protection from temperature and high pressure in the processing of canned foods that can result in poisoning when consumed. Bacteria indicate a very diverse type of metabolism. The difference in metabolic properties in a group of bacteria was originally used to determine their taxonomy, but these traits often don't harmonize with modern genetic-based classifications. The bacterial metabolism is divided into several nutrition groups based on three main criteria: energy sources, used electron donors, and carbon sources used for growth. Bacteria get energy in one of two ways: photosynthesis to convert energy from light (they're called phototrophs) or by breaking up chemical compounds using oxidation (called chemotrophs). The chemotroph bacteria use chemical compounds as an energy source by transferring electrons from donors to terminal acceptors in redox reactions. This reaction releases energy that can be used to metabolize.",

Bacteria that use inorganic compounds such as hydrogen, carbon monoxide, or ammonia as a source of electrons are called lithof, whereas organic compounds are called organotrophs. Compounds used to receive electrons are also used to classify bacteria: aerob organisms use oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor, while anaerob organisms use other compounds such as nitrate, sulfate, or carbon dioxide. Many bacteria get carbon for their cells from other organic carbons; they're called heterophrophs. Other bacteria are like phenobacterial and some purple bacteria are autotrophs, which means they get carbon by fixating carbon dioxide. In certain situations methane gas can be used by metinotroph bacteria as a source of electrons and as a substrate for carbon anabolism. In many ways, bacterial metabolism benefits ecological stability and human life. For example, some bacteria are able to fix nitrogen gas using nitrogenase enzymes. This quality is important for the environment and can be found in most of the types of bacteria metabolism mentioned above, which leads to the denitrification process, sulfate reduction, and acetogenesis, all of which are ecologically important. The process of bacterial metabolism also plays an important role in pollution; for example, sulfate reduction bacteria are responsible for the production of highly toxic forms of mercury (methylmercury) in the environment. Anaerobs nonrespiratory bacteria use fermentation to generate energy and reduce power, and emit metabolic by - product (such as ethanol in the making of beer) as waste. The facultative anaerob bacteria can switch between fermentation and some form of different terminal electron acceptor, depending on the environmental conditions in which they are. Bacteria live everywhere with an abundance of numbers. Ecosystems where bacteria live include terrestrial ecosystems, acumatic ecosystems, inside other living things, and in man - made structures.",

About 3.5 x 1030 procaritates live in deep biospheres in the ocean and between 0.25:02.5 x 1030 in the interior of the terrastrial. The lower number is found in the testrial habitats, which is 2.6 x 1029 cells, and in the acute habitats, which is 1.2 x 1029 cells. A much smaller proportion is found in the bodies of animals (including humans), in leaves and other parts of plants, as well as in the air.

In the soil, which is an important habitat for various organisms, different numbers and density of bacteria depending on the type of ecosystem. In general, the number of soil bacteria in forest ecosystems is lower than that of other ecosystems, such as bushy deserts, savannas, and farmland. To a depth of one meter, the number of procariota is estimated to be 40 million cells per gram of forest soil, while in other terrestrial ecosystems up to 2 billion cells per gram of soil. In the acumatic environment, the highest bacteria density is found in sediments at 0 to 10 centimeters thick at the bottom of the ocean, which is 460 million cells per ml. In this ocean floor sediment, bacteria play an important role in the biogeochemical cycle, such as the sulfuric cycle played by Desulfobulbaceae. Around hydrothermal vents and cold vents, extremist bacteria provide the nutrients needed to sustain life by converting soluble compounds, such as hydrogen sulfide and methane, into energy through chemosynthesis. The concentration of procaritata is found in the ecosystem of rivers, lakes of fresh water, and salt lakes of 10 million cells per ml, whereas the density of 5 million cells per ml is in the waters of the continent and in the open sea to the depths of 200m.",

On the other hand, a study published in 2016 found that the ratio is about 1.3 bacterial cells for every human cell. The number of bacteria in the human digestive tract is quite varied. They are most commonly found in the colon, which is about 1,11 cells per gram of intestinal content, while in the small intestines there are 108 cells per gram, and in the acidic stomach there are 104 microb cells per gram. In a variety of ways, only two major filums inhabit the human body, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. In addition to them, the Actinobacteria, Protoobacteria, Fusobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia are recorded. The typical example is lactic lactobacillus acedophilus acid bacteria. It is a probiotic type, which is reportedly beneficial to the body and prevents diseases such as diarrhea and degenerative disease. Bacteria can also be found on the surface of the skin and the mouth. In the mouth, bacteria can form biofilms of plaque that result in the smell of the mouth. Environmental conditions can drive and hinder bacteria growth and reproduction. The environmental factors that really affect bacteria are temperature, pH, water supply, and oxygen. Nevertheless, similar to archea, bacteria are able to live in environments that do not allow other organisms to live, such as overheating or too cold, too acidic or basey, and too salty.

As the temperature rises, enzyme reactions will continue faster until they reach optimum temperatures that allow bacterial cells to grow at the highest speed. However, once it passes a certain temperature, proteins and other cell components will experience denaturation so that the cell will die. So if the environmental temperature is below the limits of cell tolerance, the cell membrane will lose its semical form so that it can't perform its function. Based on the range of activity temperatures, bacteria are divided into four different classes: a phyrophili living in a low temperature environment with an optimum temperature of about 4 \u00b0C, mesophili living in a medium environment with an optimum temperature of about 40 \u00b0, thermophili that lives in a high environment with an optimum temperature of about 60 \u00b0 C, and hypermophili that lives in a very high environment with an optimum temperature of 88\u00b0 and even above it. For example, Thermus aquaticus is one of the species of thermophili bacteria that live in hot springs. On Antarctica, a number of bacteria are vetrified to survive temperatures up to 20 \u00b0C. Besides temperatures, bacteria growth and reproduction are also determined by degrees of acidity (PH). Most of the natural environment has pH between 3 and 9 so almost all bacteria live in this pH range. Each kind of microorganism has its own range of pH optimums, with a range of 2103 units of pH. Hence, bacteria can also be grouped based on their pH environment. Neutrophili organisms grow in neutral pH, while asidophili grows in acidic environments and alkalyphili grow in base environments.

For example, the Escherichia coli bacteria will experience a decrease in cell wall resistance and elasticity when the RH environment is less than 84%. The positive gram bacteria tend to live on higher air moisture compared with negative grams of bacteria associated with changing the structure of the cell's membrane containing lipid kalyer. Light is one of the factors that affect bacteria growth. Generally speaking, bacteria and other microorganisms can live well on normal exposure to light. However, exposure to light with high ultraviolet light (UV) intensity can be fatal to bacteria growth. The use of UV rays, x - rays, and gamma rays to sterilize an environment of bacteria and other microorganisms is known for irradiation techniques that began to develop since the beginning of the 20th century. This method has been widely applied to various needs, especially to sterilization of food to increase the saving and endurance. Some examples of pathogens that can be inhibited or eliminated include Escherichia coli 0157:H7 and Salmonella. Radiation on a certain force can cause disorders and can even be levial to living things, especially bacteria. For example, in humans, radiation can cause acute liver disease, cataracts, hypertension, and even cancer. However, there is a particular group of bacteria capable of surviving high radiation exposure, even hundreds of times greater than radiation resistance, the Deinococcaceae group. By comparison, humans in general cannot survive radiation exposure to more than 10 Grays (Gy, 1 Gy = 100rad), while bacteria that belong to this group can survive up to 5,000 Gy.",

There are also halofili bacteria that can live in a highly salty environment, such as a salinitacter ruber growing optimal at salt concentrations between 20 and 30%. In addition, a number of other bacteria that are able to live at a high rate of sugar (the osmophyil group), low water level (the xerophil group), and a very low degree of acidity. Some bacteria communities can survive in clouds with up to 20 miles [10 km] in order to survive. A team of researchers using an old DC-8 aircraft modified as a flying lab managed to sample a number of bacteria in the clouds in storm conditions. Bacteria that live in the nucleus of ice are carried by storms and survive in cloud ionization. In unicellular organisms, an increase in cell size (cell growth) and reproduction (through cell division) are two closely related things. Bacteria grow to a fixed size and then reproduce through binary division, one form of asexual reproduction. In optimum conditions, bacteria can grow and divide very rapidly; bacteria can double every 9.8 minutes. Cell division produces two identical child cells. Although still asexual reproduction, some bacteria form more complex reproductive structures to help spread newly formed child cells. For example, the formation of fruit by micobacterial bodies, the formation of hifa by Streptomyces, and the formation of buds. It occurs when a cell forms a bulge that then separates itself from the stem cell into the child's cell.",

The dense growth media, such as the plate of order, is used to isolate the pure culture of a bacterial strain. Meanwhile, liquid growth media is used when scientists want to measure the growth of bacteria or require a large amount of the volume of bacterial cells. Liquid media can be stirred up until it forms an even cell suspension so that bacteria culture can be divided and moved to other containers. The use of selective media (medias with certain add or decreased nutrients or with adding antibiotics) can help identify specific organisms. Most of the techniques to grow bacteria in the lab use high nutrients to produce large amounts of cells cheaply and quickly. In natural environments, however, the amount of nutrients is limited. This means that bacteria cannot continue to breed forever. Nutrition limitations cause bacteria to evolve with different growth strategies (see r/K selection theory). Some organisms can grow very rapidly when there is enough nutrients, such as the explosion of the algae population (and the phenobacterial) that often occurs in lakes during the summer. Other bacteria adapt to harsh environments, such as Streptomyces that produce some antibiotics to inhibit the growth of rival microorganisms. In nature, many organisms live in communities (e.g. biofilms), which allow for increased supply of nutrients and protection from environmental pressure. These relationships become essential to the growth of certain organisms or certain groups of organisms (called syntrophis). The growth of bacteria consists of four phases. When the bacteria population first enters a high nutrient environment that allows growth, they need to adapt to its new environment. The first phase is a slow phase.

The rate of the number of cells during this phase is known as the rate of growth (k), while the time it takes for a cell to replicate itself is known as the time of formation (g). During the log phase, nutrients are metabolized at maximum speed until one of the nutrients runs out so that growth begins to be limited. The third phase is the stationary phase or silent phase caused by draining nutrients. Cells reduce metabolic activity and consume the internal proteins of nonessential cells. The silent phase is a transition from rapid growth to a condition that responds to stress. There has been an increase in gene expression involved in DNA repair, antioxidants metabolism, and nutrition transport. The last phase is the death phase when bacteria run out of nutrients and die. Most bacteria have a single circular chromosome that can range from 160,000 base pairs (bp) in endosymbiotic bacteria Carsonella ruddii, up to 12.20,000. There are many variations in the shape of bacteria chromosomes, such as some species of Streptomyces and Borrelia that have one linear chromosome, while some species of Vibrio have more than one chromosome. Bacteria can also contain plasmid, small extractosomal DNA molecules that may contain genes that develop useful functions, such as antibiotic resistance, metabolic abilities, or virulence factors. The bacteria genome usually encodes several hundred to several thousand genes.

Even so, all bacteria can evolve and experience DNA changes as a result of genetic recombination or mutation. Mutations are caused by errors that occur during replication of DNA or by exposure to mutagen. Mutation rates vary greatly among species of bacteria and even among clones from one species of bacteria. Mutations can appear randomly during replication or as a result of the stress drive, when mutation rates occur in certain genes that engage in situations that limit growth. A number of bacteria can transfer genetic material between cells through three major ways. First, bacteria can extract exogenous DNA from the surrounding environment through a process called transformation. Naturally, many bacteria have the competence to extract DNA from the environment, while other bacteria have to be chemically modified to induce them to extract DNA. This ability can be developed naturally and is usually associated with stressful environmental conditions, as a bacterial adaptation to repair damaged DNA. The second way to transfer genetic material is to transduce, when bacteria infuse foreign DNA into the bacteria chromosome. There are many types of bacteria; some of them just infect and analyze the host bacteria, while others enter into the bacteria chromosomes. Bacteria fight phag infections through restorative modification systems that degrade foreign DNA and systems that use CRISPR that enable them to block viral replication through RNA interference. The third method to transfer genes is conjugation, when DNA is transferred through contact between cells directly. In ordinary circumstances, DNA transfers through transduction, conjugation, and transformation involve individual bacteria from the same species, but sometimes DNA transfers can occur between individual bacteria whose species can have significant effects, such as the transfer of antibiotic resistance.",

The most well-learned tool is flagella, a long-like filament of a whip that attaches its base to a spinning rotor to produce movement like a propeller. The direction of the flagella round is reversible, which uses cross-melted electrochemical gradients to create power. Different species of bacteria have a different number and arrangement of flagella. Some species have a single flagella (called monotric bacteria), others have flagellas at each end (amphitric), have flagella groups in the cell pole (lophoric), or distributed flagellums all over the cell (atric) surface. Spiroket's flagellum was found in a unique place, between two membranes in the periplasmic space. This group of bacteria has a typical helix body that rotates as they move. Motil bacteria approach or avoid certain stimuli. This behavior is called Taksis, which includes chemotaxis, phototaxis, energytaxis, and magnetic brainism. In one particular group, microsobacterials, individual bacteria move together to form a wave of cells that then differentify into fruit bodies containing spores. Miksobacterials move only on solid surfaces, unlike E. coli, which move in liquid or solid media. As intracellular pathogens, some species of Lysteria and Shigella move within host cells by taking over the cytoskeleton, which is usually used to move organelles inside host cells. By pushing the polymerization of the actin at one of the poles of the cell, they can form a kind of tail in order to move inside the host cell cytoplasm. Interbacterial communication forms are found on biofilms. The bacteria cells that form the aggregate exchange molecular signals to communicate and engage in coordinated multicellular behavior. The benefits of multicellular cooperation include organizing cellular division, accessing resources that cannot be used effectively by single cells, collectively survive antagonist, and optimizing the survival of the population by differentiating into different kinds of cells.",

If the density is high enough, the bacteria are going to do the same thing together, e.g. the digestive enzyme or emit light. In the quarum sense, bacteria will produce, release, and detect molecular signals. If the molecular signals are high (as a result of the number of bacteria of the same type), they then do a coordinated gene expression, which will produce proteins and initialize similar behaviors. Taksonomi aims to define the diversity of bacteria species by naming and grouping bacteria based on their similarities. Bacteria can be classified based on cell structure, cell metabolism, or the difference in cell components, such as DNA, fatty acids, pigments, antigens, and quantums. Although this method allows for identification and classification to channel bacteria, the differences found are still unclear, whether they represent variations among different species or between strains in the same species. This uncertainty is due to a lack of distinguishing structures in most bacteria as well as horizontal gene transfers among unrelated species. As a result of horizontal gene transfers, a number of closely related bacteria can have very different morphology and metabolism. To overcome this uncertainty, the classification of modern bacteria uses molecular phylogenetics, which use genetic techniques such as cytosina-guanina ratio, hybridization of genomes, and sequences of genes that have not experienced horizontal gene transfers extensively, such as the rRNA gene.

The kinship between archea and eukariota is closer than between them and bacteria. All of them, Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukiga, formed the three domain systems that are now the most widely used classification systems. However, because molecular filogenetic applications are relatively new and the number of sequences of genomes known to increase rapidly, bacteria classification remains a changing and growing area. For example, Cavalier-Smith, evolutionary biologist, argues that archea and eukariota evolved from Gram-positive bacteria. The identification of bacteria in the lab is relevant in medical science because the proper therapy is determined by the accuracy of the bacterial identification that causes infection. As a result, the need to identify pathogens is a major incentive to develop bacterial identification techniques. Gram coloring, developed in 1884 by Hans Christian Gram, grouped bacteria based on cell wall structure. The thick layer of peptidoglis on the wall of the \"Gram-Positive\" bacterial cell shows purple, while the thin-gram-negative bacterial cell wall looks pink. By combining morphology and Gram dyeing, most bacteria can be classified as one of four groups: cocus Gram-positive, grum-positive basil, cocus grum-negative, and gram-negative basil. A number of bacteria would be better identified with a painting other than Gram dyeing, especially Mycobacterium or Nocardia, showing acid resistance to Ziehl Neelsen's dyeing or similar dyeing.",

The bacteria culture is designed to encourage growth and identify specific bacteria, as well as limit the growth of other bacteria in samples. Certain types of specimens are usually treated with a particular technique; for example, phogic specimens will be dealt with to identify pneumonia - causing organisms, while feses specimens are cultured on selective media that can identify diarrhea - causing organisms, as well as prevent the growth of nonpatogenic bacteria. Specimens that are usually sterile, such as blood, urine, or cerebrospinal fluid, are cultured in conditions designed to grow all possible microorganisms. Once pathogenic bacteria are isolated, they can be further characterized based on morphology, growth patterns (like aerobic or anaerobic growth), hemolysis patterns, and their response to pigmentation. Like classification, bacterial identification techniques have also increased by molecular methods. Diagnosis uses DNA - based methods, such as polymerase chain reactions, increasingly popular because of their speed and specificity compared with cultural methods. Molecular methods also make it possible to detect and identify cells that can \"live but not be bred\" that are metabolically active bacteria but not divide. However, even using modern methods, the number of bacteria species is unknown and cannot even be predicted. According to current classification, the number of procariota species (bacterial and archea) known to reach almost 9,300. On the other hand, studies that estimate the total diversity of bacteria range from 107 to 109 different species and even these large interval estimates may have missed. Although it looks simple, bacteria can form complex associations with other organisms. The association of symbiotics can be distinguished into parasitics, mutualism, and commensalism. Because of its small size, commensurate bacteria are everywhere, both on the surface and in the body of animals and plants, as well as on the surface of other objects.",

The predator bacteria is a species of bacteria that kills and then feeds on other microorganisms. For example, it's Myxococcus xanthus that forms a herd of cells that kill and digest the bacteria that they find. Other bacteria predators are able to attach to their prey to digest and absorb nutrients, such as vampireovibrio chlorellavorus, or invade other cells and breed in their cytosol, such as Daptobacter. The predator bacteria is thought to have evolved from saprofag, which feeds on dead microorganisms, through adaptation that enables them to trap and kill other organisms. Some types of bacteria form a close relationship with other organisms to preserve their survival. One of these mutualsis symbiosis is called hydrogen transfers between species, which occurs between groups of anaerob bacteria that consume organic acid (such as grainic acid or propionic acid) and produce hydrogens with methane arches that consume hydrogen. These bacteria can't consume a lot of organic acid because their reactions will produce hydrogens that accumulate around them. Just by having a close relationship with the hydrogen consumption archea, hydrogen concentration is preserved quite low so the bacteria can keep growing. In the soil, microorganisms in the ricosphere (zone covering the surfaces of the roots and soil attached to the roots after they are slowly shaken) perform nitrogen fixation, which converts nitrogen gas into nitrogen - containing compounds. This reaction serves to provide a nitrogen form that is easily absorbed for many plants that cannot bind their own nitrogen. Meanwhile, many other bacteria are found as symbiones in humans and other organisms. For example, there are more than 1,000 species of bacteria as normal flora in the human intestines that play a role in intestinal resistance, inject vitamins such as vitamin B7, vitamin B9, and vitamin K, turning sugar into lactic acid (called lactic acid bacteria such as Lactobacellus), and fermenting complex carbohydrates that humans cannot digest.",

The pathogenic bacteria is one of the causes of infections such as tetanus (caused by Clostridium tetham), typhoid fever (Salmonella serovar Typhi), diphterium diphtheriae), syphilis (Treponema pallidum), cholera (Vibrio cholerae), leprosy (Mycobacterium leprae), and tuberculosis (Myberculosis), up to a variety of food - based diseases. A disease may have been known to cause the pathogen after many years, such as gastric disease and pylori helicacter. Bacterial diseases are also important in agriculture and agriculture, such as bacteria that cause leaf disease, flame disease, and plant function, as well as paratuberculosis, mastitis, and anthrax on livestock. Each species of pathogen has a typical spectrum of interaction with its host. Bacteria in the genus Staphylococcus and Streptoccus can lead to massive, vasodilating, and death. Yet, they are also part of normal human flora and are usually in the skin or in the nose without causing any disease at all. Other bacteria have always caused disease in humans, like Rickettsia which is an obligatory intracellular parasite capable of growing and breeding only in other organism cells. One species of Rickettsia causes typhoids, while the other species cause typhoid fever in the Rocky Mountains. Chlamydia, another obligate intracellular pathogen, contains species that can cause pneumonia and urinary tract infection, and may be involved in coronary heart disease. Some other species, such as Pseudomonas aepunosa, Burkholderia cenocepacia, and Mycobacterium avium, are opportunistic pathogens that cause disease especially in people who suffer from cystic immunosuppression or fibrosis.",

There are many types of antibiotics that are grouped into groups. Each class of antibiotics has a different action in preventing certain chemical processes in bacterial cells found within the host. Examples of antibiotics that produce selective toxicity are chloramfenicol and puromisina. These two antibiotics inhibit bacteria ribosomes, but they are not ribosomes of different structures. Antibiotics are used to treat human diseases and to speed up animal growth at intensive farms, which may contribute to the rapid growth of antibiotic resistance in the bacterial population. A bacterial infection can be prevented by an antiseptic act, such as sterilizing the skin before stabbing it with a syringe and maintaining the sterilization of the catheter that will be inserted into the body. Surgeons and dentistry are also sterilized to prevent bacterial contamination. A disinfectant such as bleach is used to kill bacteria or other pathogens on the surface of objects to prevent contamination and reduce the risk of infection. The diversity of bacteria and their metabolic pathways cause bacteria to play a major role in the environment. For example, the saprite bacteria break down dead plants or animals and remains or dung organisms. They break proteins, carbohydrates and other organic compounds into CO2, ammonia gas, and other simpler compounds. Examples of the saphith bacteria include Proteus and Clostridium. Not only is it acting as a disassembler of organic compounds, some groups of saprofit bacteria are also opportunists.

Once the nitrification reaction is complete, there will be a recirative process performed by the denitrification bacteria. Denitrification itself is an anaerobic reduction of nitrate compounds into free nitrogen (N2) that are easier to absorb and metabolize by various living things. The example of the bacteria capable of doing this metabolism is Pseudomonas stutzeri, Pseudomonas aewonosa, and Paracoccus denitrificians. In addition, it also produces nitrogen in other forms, such as lutrogen oxide (N2O). Such compounds can not only play a vital role in life of various organisms but can also play a role in the acid rain phenomenon and the breakdown of the ozone. The N2O compound will oxidize into a NO compound and then react with ozone (O3) forming NO2 which will return to earth in the form of acid rain (HNO2). Agricultural agriculture is known as a group of bacteria capable of symbioticizing with plant roots or living freely on the ground to help grow soil.

The Eastern Orthodox Church is the only true church established by Christ. Jews who obeyed all the religious traditions and commands set forth within the Talmud were often called Orthodox Jews.

Aristotle divided philosophy into four problems: logic, physics, metaphysics and practical knowledge. An analysis of philosophy is done using sylogism. Aristotle's thinking about logic that uses deductive methods to be the basis for formal logic. Aristotle also believed that the existence of science was intended to support human life. Aristotle was born in a small town called Stagira in 384 B.C.E. This city is part of the Kalkidii peninsula. Aristotle's upbringing was carried out by his family in Atarneus, Anatolia. This condition was the result of his father's death at a young age during the trial in Pella, central Macedonia. His father's job is as a physicist. At first, Aristotle was a student of Plato. But then he rejected some of Plato's thoughts and began his own philosophy. Aristotle founded an educational center and research called Lyceum. Through this place, he conveys his thoughts that then influence the thinking of philosophers, theologians or other scientists. Aristotle lived in an environment that supported cultural and intellectual creativity. In his lifetime, Greek city states were divided by the defeat of Athena of Sparta in the Peloponesian War in 404 B.C.

Aristotle considered human thinking to be more than three types of abstractions that make up philosophy, physics, mathematics and metaphysics. Man transcends physics when he begins to think while making observations. During thinking, the human mind escapes from observation that uses the senses to feel everything that it can feel. Common knowledge is then recognized by the obvious and the real. The knowledge of physics is then formed through abstract knowledge and human intelligence. In turn, mathematical abstractions enable humans to understand invisible matter. Sense escapes from everything that can be understood. All of the material characteristics of this abstraction then produce science. Meanwhile, the abstraction of metaphysics appears after man performs the abstraction of physics. In the third abstraction, humans have been able to think about the reality of all matter along with its origins and the purpose of its formation. Aristotle considered this abstraction to be the first philosophy. Aristotle used the term \"first philosophy\" compared to metaphysics because he thinks all philosophy comes from this abstraction. The first philosophy in Aristotle's view can be interpreted as two understandings. The first is that science becomes the first foundation. And the second is as a science that discusses the existence of an object. Aristotle proposed that new methods of knowledge and truth were divided into two. First, inductive and second methods are deductive methods. Inductive methods aim to sum up specific things into a general conclusion. Meanwhile, the deductive method only concludes the truth of two things that are certain and without question. The quality of the deductive method is to conclude from something common to special.",

Aristotle became this deductive method as the best method of gaining new knowledge and truth based on conclusions. This method is known as the deductive sylogistic method. Aristotle became a pioneer in collection and classification of biological species. Aristotle's tendency toward natural science has to do with critical analysis. Such activities are done to learn about the laws of nature and the balance of nature. The existence of matter indicates that matter exists in some form. Moreover, he argued that there was one purpose to the movement of objects. Aristotle's thinking about motion led to a causal relationship that led to the thought of the first driver who didn't move. The direction of his thinking leads to understanding of God. Aristotle made rhetoricals an independent science with the same position as any other science. According to Aristotle, rhetorical speech is not mere nonsense, but effective and ethical speech in conveying the truth. Aristotle suggested that rhetoricals could not be made part of other sciences.

Aristotle considered logic to be a science that was used to do the correct summation of things. He made logic the basis for all kinds of knowledge. His thinking about logic conveys in a collection of writings called To Organon. This name means a method for gaining scientific knowledge. In his writings, Aristotle gave priority to the issue of sylogism. To Organon is divided into six chapters that each discuss one particular concept. In order, the concept discussed is category, proposition, sylogism, proof, the art of debate and error. To Organon is a work that makes logic a science.

This religion provides an obligation to be followed by all its people without regard to strata, caste, or sects such as honesty, chastity, and self - control. Western experts view Hinduism as a fusion or synthesis of various Indian traditions and cultures, with a variety of roots and no founding figures. Its bases include Brahmanism, the religions of the time civilizations of the Indus River valley, and popular local traditions. The synthesis appeared about 500 JUNE200 B.C.E., and grew side by side with the Buddhist religion until the 8th century. From North India, the \"Hindu Synthesis\" spread to the south, to parts of Southeast Asia. It's supported by Sanscritization. Since the 19th century, under the predominance of Western colonialism and Indology (when the term \"Hinduism\" began to be widely used), Hindu religion has been confirmed to be the meeting place for various coherent and independent traditions. The popular understanding of Hinduism is promoted by the \" Hindu modernism\" movement, which emphasizes the mysticism and unity of Hindu tradition. Hindutva and Hindu politics ideologies emerged in the 20th century as the political and identity of the Indian nation.",

Historians have also referred to the tribal civilization as the Indus Valley Civilization. That's why the term \"Hindu\" is a geographical term, and it doesn't refer to any religion. The Hindu word is absorbed by the European languages of the Arabic term al-Hind, and refers to the country for the people who inhabit the area around the Sindhu River. The Arabic term is derived from the Persian term Hind, which refers to all the tribes in India. In the 13th century, Hindustan came up with an alternative name called India, which means \"The Hindu country.\" Hindu religious terms are then often used in some Sanskrit texts such as the Rajatarangini of Kashmir (Hinduka, ca. 1450) and several of Gaudiya Waisnawa texts from the 16th to the 18th century who speak Bengali, such as Caitanyacaritameta and Caitanyabhagawata.

The idea of Hinduism as a single world religion was popularized in the 19th century by European Indologues who referred to the \"castes of brahmana\" as their information about the religions of India. This refers to a tendency to assert literature and belief in Weda as \"escence\" to common Hindu religious practices, as well as to the modern 'dodtrin Hindu' relationship with various Wedant colleges (specially Adwaita Wedanta). Colonialism has been a significant factor in the influence of brahmana caste and \"brahmanization\" in Hindu society. The customs of the Brahmins also influenced the understanding of Hinduism in the eyes of Europeans. The Brahmins preserved Hindu books that were then studied by Europeans. The authority of the Bible has been targeted by European research. The establishment of the textual basis of Hinduism by European orientists is based on a tendency to refer to written authority rather than on oral authority.

Some Hindu religious activities can be viewed as common in that religion, while even unusual ones can still be included in Hinduism. Based on those thoughts, Ferro-Luzzi wrote an abbreviation to Prototype Theory to define Hinduism.

Gandhi claimed that Hinduism was free of forced dogma and was able to accommodate various forms of self-expression in large scopes. In Hinduism, the difference in every tradition, even in other religions, is not to be contested, because there is a belief that everyone worships God with a different name, whether recognized or not by the people. In the book of Regweda, there is a temple often quoted by Hindus to emphasize this, as follows: \"There is only one truth, but scholars call him by many names.\" (I:CLXIV:46) Hindu religion views the world as a large family that magnifies one common truth, so that it values all forms of confidence and does not question religious differences.

As a result of Brahminism, He is God with the attributes; He is without any ascribed attribute, and/or Almighty God, according to the measure and the flow.

This Mazhab asserts that there is no prohibition against imagining God with certain qualities, but the true purpose of life is to feel that \"something real\" in all beings is no different than Brahman. Mazhab Adwaita can be said to be a monism or a panteism because it believes that the universe is not merely Brahman, but in \"his bond\" is the same as Brahman.

In the book of Samchayapravachana Sutra of the Samkhya stream it is declared that the existence of God (Ishwara) cannot be proved so that (the existence of the Lord) cannot be recognized. Samkhya thinks that an eternal God cannot be the source of a world that is constantly changing. It's said that God is a metaphysical notion made for a state. Proponents of the Ramamasa stream, which is based on rituals and orthopedics, suggest that there is not enough evidence to prove the existence of God.

Atman and soul terms are sometimes used in the same context. In a sense, atman is a spark of Brahman, whereas the soul is the drive of all living things. According to the monistic Hindu theology (such as Madhib Adwaita Wedanta), the individual spirit is nothing different from the Brahman. The individual Sukma is called the soulman, while the Brahman is called the paramatman. Therefore, this teaching is called a non-dualist stream. When an individual's body is destroyed, the soul doesn't fall apart. Rather, it moves on to a new body through reincarnation. The soul experiences it because it's cloaked by awidya or \"unconsciousness\" that it's actually the same as a paramatman. The purpose of life according to Mazhab Adwaita is to achieve the awareness that the real atman is equal to the Brahman. The Book of Upanishad states that anyone who feels that atman is the essence of each individual, then he will be aware of equality with Brahman, so that it reaches Moksa (freedom or freedom from reincarnation). Yoga of the Patanjali Resi considered in Yogasutra is different from the monism described in the philosophy of Adwaita. According to yoga, the highest spiritual achievement is not to realize that everything in the universe is virtual. The self - respect that comes when it reaches the highest religious experience is not a mere atman. It's just one of the individuals' identities. Breaking down the wall of the human consciousness to build an individual's identity with the spirit of the universe, is the goal of yoga.

There are many gods, but they are a manifestation of various aspects of a \"real reality.\" The existence of monoism and monotheism is intertwined.

The power of the god is different from that of the three eternal chief gods. Shiva and Vishnu are glorified as the Arch god for their fame in holy books and shrines. The two of them, along with Brahma, were viewed as the Trimurti the three aspects of the Almighty. These three aspects symbolize the entire Samsara cycle according to Hindu religion: Brahma as creators, Vishnu as protectors or guardians, and Shiva as converts. Two of the three gods, Vishnu and Shiva, had a large number of followers to form the two main streams (Waisnawa and Saiwa) in the body of Hinduism. In a study of Trimurit, Sir William Jones stated that Hindus \"worship God in three forms: Vishnu, Shiva, Brahma... the fundamental idea of Hinduism, that metamorphosis, or transformation, were exemplified through the concept of awatra.\" The Tridewi (\"Three Goddesss\") in Hindu religion plays an important role as a Trimurti and serves as a match for Trimaturi. Brahma is the Creator, so he needs knowledge or Goddess Saraswati. Vishnu is the Protector, so he needs prosperity, which is manifested as Goddess Laksmi (Sri).

Some well - known awataras are the manifestations of Vishnu, including Rama (the chief office of Ramayana) and Kresna (the important place in the Mahabharata). Karma is literally translated as an act, a work, a deed, and can be described as \"the moral law of cause, therefore, of effect.\" According to the laws of karma, good fortune comes from past good deeds, and bad luck comes from past bad acts, which is an action-reaction system and forms a cycle of reincarnation. These causal phenomena apply not only to the material world, but also to one's thoughts, words, actions, and actions. According to the Book of Upanishad, a soul forms a sanskara of actions, either physically or mentally. Linga-sarira (a body that is more subtle than a physical body but more violent than a soul) is attached to those impressions, and it brings them to the next life, thus creating its own way of life for everyone. Hence, the universal, neutral, and never - missed concept of karma is linked to reincarnation, as is one's personality, character, and family. Karma unites concepts of free will and fate. Because Hinduism believes that the soul is indestructible, death is not viewed as a scourge to life because it is a natural phenomenon. Hence, a person who has abandoned his ambitions and desires, has no other responsibilities in the world, or is infected with a deadly disease can attempt death in the way of Prayopavesa. The cycle of action, reaction, birth, death, and birth is an ongoing process called samsara. Understanding reincarnation and karma is a powerful premise in Hindu philosophy. In the book of Bhagawadgita (II:22), it is written: In Hindu belief, samsara gives humans the opportunity to enjoy a moment of pleasure at every birth. As long as humans continue to enjoy such pleasures, they will be reborn.",

Such realization frees one from samsara and ends the cycle of rebirth. The conceptualization of mox differs depending on the mazhab or the flow of Hinduism. For example, Mazhab Adwaita Wedanta believes that after reaching Moksa, atman no longer recognizes himself as an individual, but realizes that Brahman is identical in all things, including his similarities with the Atman. The followers of Mazhab Dwaita (twolistist) viewed individuals as part of the Brahman, and after reaching Moksa, they were sure to gain eternity in the loca along with the manifestation of Ishwara. Therefore, it's inlined that the Dwaita followers hope to enjoy sugar, while the Adwaita followers hope to \"be sugar.\" Classic Hindu philosophy acknowledges the four things that must be met as the purpose of human life as described below the so-called purusarta: Hindus fulfill their purpose in life by taking different paths.

Doing one yoga doesn't mean ignoring the other. Many Hinduism mazhabs teach that various yogas naturally blend in and support other yoga practices.

A person who studies high levels of meditation (as the yoga king suppresses) must manifest the basic principles of karmayoga, jnanouga, and bhaktiyoga, both directly and indirectly. According to Hindu Hindu figure Swami Vivekananda, Hinduism is based on a collection of spiritual guidelines found by different people in different times. For centuries, it's been handed down orally in verse so that it can be recited, until finally it's written. For centuries, the resi filtered out the teaching and expanded its postulates.

Hindu religiosity also plays an important role in the nationalist movement. Hindu society is categorized into four classes, called colors, which are the following: The Bhagawadgita connects color to one's (swadharma) obligations, causation (swabh\u0101wa), and natural tendency (gu JULIA). Based on color understanding according to Bhagawadgita, Hindu character Sri Aurobindo made the doctrine that one's work should be determined by his natural talent and capacity. In the book of Manusmerti, there are different groups of caste. Mobility and flexibility in color reject the alleged social discrimination in the caste system, as some sociologists put it, even though some experts disagree. Experts debate whether the caste system is part of Hinduism regulated by holy books, or simply the custom of the community.u] Various experts argue that the caste system was built by the British colonial regime. According to Hindu Hindu teacher Sri Ramakrishna (1836 JULI 1886): The lovers of God are not included in certain castes... a brahman without love for God is no longer brahman. And a paria without love for God is not a paria anymore. And he who is abased shall be purified by it, and he who is purified shall be exalted by God. According to Wedanta literature, people who are out of color are called \"coloritas.\" Experts like Adi Sankara assert that not only Brahmans exceed all colors, but one who can unite with Him can also transcend all differences and restrictions of caste-castes.",

The last stage is Sannyasa, which is to spend the rest of your life doing tapa brata, or trying to break free from worldly bonds. The release was in order to find God, and to find a way to leave the mortal body in peace, to achieve a condition called Moksa.

According to Herakleitos, nothing in the universe is fixed or permanent. Nothing really exists, everything is in the process of being.

The view of logos here should not simply be compared to the concept of logos on the mazhab Stoa. Logos is a ratio that becomes a law that controls everything and moves everything, including people. Logos is also understood as material, but it transcends ordinary matter at the same time. This was because in those days, no philosopher was able to separate between spiritual and material ones. According to Herakleitos, each object consists of the opposite. Nevertheless, in the resistance there is still unity. In short, it can be said that 'that one is many and many are one.'

Seismology that produces R waves with these middle frequencies is used in geophysics and geotechnical techniques. The geometric dispersion of R waves is used as a base of seismic methods. The imaging results were recorded using inversion solutions with seismic data as a database. Recording was done to both the source of active waves and the source of passive waves. Imaging can also be done using microtremors. Seismology is one of the areas in which the Earthology is combined by geology and geophysics used in human adaptation with nature. This adaptation is reviewed in terms of knowledge and technology. Seismology uses a computerized tomography scanning technique adopted from medical science to imaging subsurface structures using earthquake wave data. This imaging technique is used in codectering research for human anatomy imaging. In seismology, this adoption technique is called seismic tomography. Images using seismic tomography techniques can provide detailed information about the interior structure of the Earth. This is one of the advantages of a source of seismic information in energy carried by earthquake waves from earthquake centers to all parts of the earth through the mediums it passes. The seismograph is a tool used by seismologists to know the extent of the damage caused by the earthquake. It's capable of recording the result of an earthquake wave on the Earth's surface. The seismograph was first made by Chinese astronomer Zhang Heng. Modern seismographs use electronic systems. However, the base component remains the same as the traditional seismograph, a drum with paper on its top.",

One end of the seismograph was presented with a bar made of box - shaped metal. This cross is stuck to the ground. The other end of the bar became where the load was placed. Whereas the pen is plugged into the load. In this condition, there is a constant rotation of the drums. When the earthquake occurred, only the weight part of the seismograph was motionless. The pen will create irregular lines when the drums and paper move towards the pen. These are the lines that record the movement of land from the earthquake. This note is called a seismogram. The information that can be obtained from seismograms is the power of earthquakes and the distance from seismographs. The lack of seismogram is not to give accurate information about the center of the earthquake. The location of the center of the earthquake can be measured precisely by adding two other seismographs that are installed at different places. Building plans in areas where earthquakes are prone require more than knowledge of local soil and geological conditions. Insight on seismology and the potential for seismic disaster is also needed especially in the area prone to seismic disasters. Seismology and earthquake engineering were made to reflect on the effects of earthquakes on humans and the environment. Seismology containing constant or separate seismic structure information has become one indication of the modeling of the source of the earthquake or the manufacture of seismotectonic models. Sesemological observation is part of an anatomy imaging of the seismogenic zone. The imaging of using sesemological observations is done along with the observations of post-shaking earthquakes, modeling seismic data refracts, and imaging of reflection seismic imaging.",

Although this scientific mention also applies in general because some circles divide Santis into two areas based on his field of science, Saintis in the fields of Natural Science and Saintis in Social Science. Saintis can be distinguished into two categories that is: Saintis studies certain aspects of nature in an organized, systemic way and through various classified scientific methods. The scope of science is limited to a range of things that the senses can understand (visions, touch, hearing, touch and taste) or can be said to be knowledge acquired through concrete learning and proof. Scientists aim to produce a useful model of reality and contribute to the development of natural science. Saintis knew some of the scientific methods used in practical terms: Until the end of the 19th or early 20th century, Saintis was simply referred to as the philosopher of nature. These daily reviews were so profound about philosophy that they could finally formulate a new theory to explain the various natural phenomena that took place. To date, the mention of Saintis is so seldom used that it is widespread. A scientist is generally a scholar with a degree in S. Si., although from another field of science he can also call himself Saintis.

At a certain point in the burning reaction there will be a flame, called the ignition point. The flame is an invisible piece of fire. Fire consists mainly of carbon dioxide, water vapor, oxygen and nitrogen. If it's hot enough, the gas can be ionized to produce plasma. Depending on the burning substance, and other compounded substances, the color of flame and intensity can vary. Unbridled flames can result in heavy fires, potentially causing damage. Fire is an important process that affects ecological systems around the world. Fires have such positive effects as stimulating growth and maintaining various ecological systems. Negative effects, fires are harmful to life and possessions, causing atmospheric pollution and water contamination. If fires eliminate protective vegetation, heavy rains can cause an increase in soil erosion by water. Moreover when vegetation is burned, the nitrogen it contains is released into the atmosphere, unlike such elements as potassium and phosphorus that remains in the ashes and is quickly recycled into the soil. The loss of nitrogen caused by fire will result in a long - term reduction of soil fertility. But soil fertility may still be restored, because nitrogen molecules in the atmosphere are \"tied up\" and converted into ammonia by natural phenomena such as lightning and pod plants that are \"genid bindings\" like clovers, peas and green beans.",

The object produced other terms such as ethnoastronomi the ethnography and astronomy and astronomical anthropology with studies that were often sorted or even considered equal to archaeastronomim. Anthony F. Aveni, one of the pioneers of the development of archaeoastronomi science, states that archaeoastronomi has become a meeting of three fields of science that have a bearing on the study of ancient astronomy: Arthoastronomi Science is a relatively new branch of science. Nevertheless, studies with related topics have long been done by researchers. The birth of archeoastronomi science was originally based on the interest of archeologists in the 1960s to study the connections of ancient civilization monuments such as the Pyramid Giza, Stonehenge, and Newgrange to constellations of stars, planets, and the movements of the Sun. As time went on, the themes and problems that were studied in archeoastronomi science began to expand. Arkeoastronomi no longer merely examines the relationship of ancient monuments against the sky, but begins to pay attention to concepts related to culture, calendars, ancient navigation systems, to political events. \u25aaSyanislaw Iwanizewski, (Alignments and Orientations Again). According to its methods and language sources, archeoastronomi studies can be divided into two types of approaches of green archaeoastronomi and brown archaeoastronomi.

To reach accurate conclusions, both types of approaches do well to combine with one another. Research conducted on ancient monuments in the Old World (Asia, Africa, and Europe) in search of the connection to such monuments as planets, constellations of stars, suns, comets and moons, commonly using statistical data. This statistical data is the result of the relative position of the celestial bodies on the monument or the site of the archaeastronomi. This approach is called a green archeoastronomi approach or green archaeeoastonmy. The approach of green archaeoastronomi involves a strict selection of data and field methodology. The use of this approach, for example, in research conducted in the 1970s in Stonehenge. The study aims to find a link between the orientation or the landscape of the site to the position and angles of the Sun and the Moon. However, the lack of social data such as historical records, reliefs, or rituals found or examined to support these conclusions, resulting in the connection Stonehenge with the Moon and the Sun's movements from the study is still a debate. This is then becoming a unique criticism of the green archaeoastronomi approach that is thought to ignore the social-cultural aspects.

A broader approach by embracing these disciplines is not common in archaeoastronomi where at the time, most artaeastronomit studies in the Old World simply lean the results on math and Statsitic data. One example of the use of this method was in an archaeostronomi study of Maya culture in Mesoamerica. The Maya are known to have many ancient accounts related to astronomy. There are records that specifically explain the motions of planets such as Venus and Mars, the changes in phases of the Moon, and other astronomical events that correspond to modern observations. Instead of using statistical data related to the matching position of the heavenly bodies on certain Mayan monuments, as is the case with the green approach of archaeeoastronomy, Susan Milbrath, a researcher from the University of Florida, U.S.A., trying to synthesize these astronomical links through the stories of the people, rituals, and iconographic data of paintings, reliefs, and statues found in the ceramic and buildings of the Mayan tribe. From his research, Milbrath discovered a wide range of links between art and culture in the Mayan tradition of astronomical events, such as the solar eclipse. An analysis of the relative positions of heavenly bodies such as the Sun, the Moon, the stars, and the planets to orientation of an archaeostronomi site and ancient monuments of a culture, is a common source used in archaeostronomi studies to identify the links of sites and monuments to astronomical phenomena. This analysis then obtained statistical data related to the alignment of a celestial object to orientation from an archaeostronomi site at a given time. This data can be reanalyzed manually or used software so that its results are converted into models, diagrams, or computer images that can then give the answer to the question \"do the archaeoastronomi sites or ancient monuments have anything to do with objects and astronomical phenomena? \"That's why I'm here.",

In this cycle, there are three important positions that are usually parameters by archeoastronomi experts to determine the link between a culture and the movement of the Sun. These three positions are winter solstices, summer solstices, and the equinox point of the Sun. The winter solstice (happened in December in the northern hemisphere and in June in the southern hemisphere) occurs when the Sun has the lowest inclination angle (-23.5\u00b0). This then makes the Sun rise in the southernmost part of its position in the horizon and makes the daylight the shortest. On the other hand, the summer solstice (that occurred in June in the northern hemisphere and in December in the southern hemisphere) occurred when the Sun had the highest inclination angle (+23.5\u00b0). This then makes the Sun rise in the northernmost part of its position in the horizon and makes the daylight last the longest. The next point is called the equinox point that occurs twice a year in March and September where at this point, the Sun has no angle of inclination on the earth that makes the sunrise position right east and also the setting Sun position that is right in the west. In order for this analysis to be relevant, calculations on the link between an archaeostronomi site and the heavenly bodies must take into account the state of the sky in the past which today has changed because of the change in constellations, as well as the shift inclination of the Sun and the Moon. Moreover, the refraction of light by the Earth's atmosphere must also be taken into account so that the results obtained are ever more accurate.",

Artifacts or archaeological relics produced by a culture in the past can give evidence of how important an object in the sky is to that culture. Like archaeology, archaeastronomi also analyzes ancient relics. However, archeoastronomi limits its language by identifying, sifting, and then analyzing an artifact that is believed to have something to do with human perception and actions of objects and phenomena in the sky. Archaeostronomi science has a major role in transforming these artifacts into an astronomical fact that can provide information about past human interest in objects and phenomena in the sky. Astronomous facts that have been acquired and then transformed back into an anthropological fact that can show how human interest in phenomena and celestial bodies has a bearing on their traditions and culture. For example, one of the most famous archaeoastronomi artifacts - Antykithera's mechanisms produced by ancient Greek culture. This artifact can be said to be an ancient computer with a mechanism that can predict the movement of heavenly bodies such as the Sun, the Moon, and some planets in the solar system. Antykithera mechanism shows how ancient Greek civilizations had become very familiar with the movements of heavenly bodies in those days, and of course the ancient Greek culture was widely known as rich in mythology associated with celestial bodies.

In ancient Egyptian cultures, for example, in ancient funeral complexes this culture was discovered paintings of the constellations and dates that were then known to the Egyptian people. Meanwhile, on Maya civilizations in Central America, their date, cultural traditions, and predictions about the phenomena that take place in the sky are well written in a codex. In Cambodia, there is a relief depicting the movement of the sun found in one part of the wall of Angkor Wat. To link a practice of culture to objects and phenomena in the sky, it also requires ethnographic studies that include study of ethnic groups, identities, territorial boundaries, traditions or rituals, etc. The social facts and characteristics obtained from the study can be made the starting point to examine the connections of a culture and its practice of objects and phenomena in the sky. This can be done because a concept of cosmology, method of observation, and interpretation of an astronomical phenomenon has a direct relationship with the interest of a culture in astronomy. In this regard, these concepts, methods, and interpretations are not an individual arrangement, but are put together collectively or traditionally by society, so that they have an impact and an effect on their culture. Constructions of verbal traditions such as folk and local legends have managed to identify cultural connections in various regions of matter or phenomena that occur in the sky, such as Maya cultures in South America that use folk stories and symbols as a metaphor for astronomical events such as eclipses, the sightings of the Milky Way galaxy, and the solstice of the Sun, or in the culture of native Polynesians that use oral traditions as a clue to the development of the place of worship to have a specific orientation against the Sun.",

Usually, it refers to astronomical cycles such as the change of the lunar phase, the emergence or loss of a constellation, and the movement of the rising-up positions of the Sun each year along the horizon as a result of the tilt of the earth's position on the Sun. The diversity of cultures and social needs, as well as the uncertain astronomical cycles, create a wide variety of variations between calendars that exist in every human culture. This later became a study of researchers in the field of archaeostronomi into the specific relationship between a calendar on art, trust, and tradition, in a human culture. The term calendar has a broad understanding in the field of archaeoastronomi research. Researchers do not have limited definitions of the calendar in the arrangement of dates, days, months, and years. Some ancient texts, symbols, or tablets that record or predict events in the sky, are also considered calendars by researchers. A historical relic can be considered a calendar if it meets at least one of the following four criteria: In ancient civilizations, the sky is believed to be a source of power that can control the seasons or even govern the world. Astronomy observation is then believed by various cultures as a way to find out or acquire that power. Moreover, astronomical observations in ancient culture aim to create a cosmological concept that can explain the universe by using various mythologys. These mythologys then have a distinct influence on belief and understanding of society in a culture of the shape and origin of the universe. The Boshongo people in Central Africa, for example, believe that the universe was created out of darkness when Lord Bumpa suffered pain in his stomach and then spewed out the Sun, the Moon, the stars, and all kinds of living creatures including humans.",

Meanwhile, on one of the concepts of cosmology of ancient Mesopotamian civilizations, the Akkadians believed that the universe was originally just filled with water and was in a very chaotic state. Conflict between gods in their beliefs then made the Sun, Earth, Moon, stars, and all living things. The concept of cosmology of ancient Mesopotamian civilization also divided the universe into two parts of Earth and Heaven. The parts of the Earth are described as flat and surrounded by domes of the sky filled with the Sun and the stars. The cosmological concept of a culture in society is often influenced or influenced by their traditions and beliefs. Archaeastronomi science studies then played a role in identifying and analyzing these traditions and beliefs so that the cultural connection to the bodies and phenomena in the sky was discovered. For example, by studying the timing of the rituals of belief and then connecting them to the phenomena that occurred in the sky at the time, or by studying the orientation of buildings in a culture to know the perception of peoples in the celestial bodies. As one of the oldest sciences, the first application of astronomy is believed to be the utilization of the stars as navigational aids. Sky objects are very useful as navigational devices especially in areas with homogeneous landscapes such as deserts, oceans, or polar ice sheets. One of the most obvious phenomena that can be exploited is the rising and setting position of the Sun that directly indicates east and west. However, the estimate of a direction based on the rising of the Sun's sunset is a rough estimate and tends to be inaccurate. This is because the rising and setting position of the Sun in the horizon depends on time, for example in December the position of the rising Sun will tend to be in the north, while the June position of the rising Sun tends to be south of the horizon.",

Archeoastronomi science then played a role in identifying and analyzing the utilization of celestial bodies as navigational devices in various cultures specifically. For example, in Polynesian communities that successfully occupied many islands in the Pacific Ocean, Aboriginal tribes that crossed the landscape with relatively homogeneous landscapes in Australia, or Inuit tribes that used the Sun and stars as their guides across the Arctic region. Reviews of archaeoastronomi studies in the Americas at pre-Columbus times can be divided into three regions of North America, Central America (Mesoamerica), and South America. In the northernmost part of the Americas, Inuit culture uses astronomical phenomena as part of their traditions, navigational systems, and ritualistic beliefs. Related to this tradition, the Inuit people then gave the names of various constellations that they could observe in the northern skies.

Furthermore, celestial bodies are also believed to be the influence that archecoastronomi researchers have on the orientation of Mesoamerican culture.

Entering the Middle Ages, scientific development in general in European culture was slow before revolutionary figures such as Tycho Brahe, Copernicus, and Galileo revealed their views or observations of the heliocentric nature of the solar system, as well as the pioneer birth of modern science. Despite a slow developmental delay, astronomy still has an impact on medieval European culture, such as church development.

For example, in the manufacture of temples of worship or of agricultural activity, Mesopotamian culture had to pay attention to the shape and position of certain constellations that were thought to have good omens. Surely to mark the time and know the position of the constellations, by the 10th century B.C., Mesopotamia's bubbly had compiled a number of calendars that could even be used by civilians or common people. The Mesopotamian civil calendar was a solarcandra calendar and usually had 12 Months a year. The number of days in one month on this calendar varies from 29 to 30 days to the total number of 355 days a year. Mesopotamian culture then divided its time in one day into a time unit called b\u25aaru, in which one b\u25aaru was equal to two hours (1/12 days) in modern civilization. Beru was then divided back into smaller units of U \u25aa; one U is equal to four minutes (1/360 days) in modern civilization. This system is called the sexagesimal and then passed on to various regions, even to the basis of the timekeeping of modern civilization. Islamic civilization then contributed enormously to the development of astronomical science in this region in medieval times. Contributions of scientists in Islamic civilization at this time through the development of concepts and the accuracy of calculations and observations either through mathematical theories or through the development of celestial instruments of observation. Observation instruments or calculations used or developed in this period as widely as astrolabes, solar clocks, portable quadrants, and other mechanisms that can simulate the movements of celestial bodies.

One of the oldest evidences found in an ancient tomb thought to have been made in the 40th century B.C., in the province of Henan, China, suggests that during that period Chinese culture had known and involved constellations in their culture. During the same period, Chinese culture was also known to have made astronomical ornaments such as the Moon, the Sun, and the constellations, in the culture that they produced. In the 20th century B.C., in addition to using celestial bodies as ornaments of art or symbols in certain rituals, Chinese culture has also used the solstice as a sign of changing seasons. Further during the War Nation period until the Qin Dynasty era (488-206 B.C.), Chinese society had developed instruments to investigate astronomical phenomena more accurately to predict the seasons and other astronomical phenomena such as lunar eclipses and solar eclipses. During this period too, Chinese society has developed the sun clock, and it knows the movements of five other major planets in the solar system of Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. Entering the first millennium of the Common Era, the development and application of astronomy in Chinese culture has been vast. The Chinese astronomer of this period has been able to create a celestial map of the constellations that is highly accurate. Even in this period, Chinese culture has been able to simulate the movement of celestial bodies such as the Moon, the Sun, and some planets mechanically within a water - powered astronomical clock. Although not as much as found in China, there are historical evidences that have shown that Japan and Korea have long used astronomical phenomena to help them with their activities.",

In this period and centuries later, Koreans adopted astronomical calendars produced by Chinese culture and were able to produce their own calendars in about the 14th century A.D. Besides the calendar, the Korean culture has various other archaeostronomi sites, one of which was Champsong-dae (Star Tower) created in the 7th century A.D. Although no direct evidence has been found, some experts believe that this tower in the past served as an ancient observatory. Japan's geographical isolation by the oceans makes cultural evolution in this region relatively different from China and Korea, including the relics associated with archeoastronomi. Research in archaeoastronomi in Japan has been an obstacle as a result of at least the historical or cultural relics associated with this field. Since ancient times, however, Japanese society has taken advantage of astronomical phenomena as part of the calendar system, of the change of seasons, and of the navigation of fishermen to search for fish at sea. Also Japanese cultural connections with celestial bodies were also found in an ancient tomb in Nara prefecture thought to have been built in the 7th to 8th century A.D. In this tomb, there are paintings associated with constellations.

The characteristic of the Polynesian society known as the sailor nation also makes astronomy play an important role in their navigational needs. The Polynesian community has various religious sites that are currently part of archeoastronomi research. Through data obtained from the study of oral traditions that developed in the Polynesian region, it is estimated that since the 13th century A.D., the Polynesian community has been believed to have used the solstice of the Sun as a reference to the creation of temples. The movement of the Moon and constellations also played an important role in the social life of Polynesian society. People in this region have been able to put together a date based on the Moon's movement and determine the change of seasons based on the solstice. One of the most prominent cultural sites in the Polynesian region was a series of Moai statues located on Easter Island.

Bones also have the function of protecting internal organs, as well as the mineral storage in the body. In an ossification process that's a process of bone formation that occurs during the growth of the fetus and after the birth of the individual. The bone function is as follows. The condensation bone is a bone made up of the Harvestian or Osteon systems packed together. In the nape of the Harvestian system consists of a channel surrounded by concentric rings in the middle of a matrix. Among the lamelae are bone cells that are in utensils, which are interconnected with the Harvestian canal through a tiny channel called the Canalikuli. Spongiosa bone is a lighter bone and is not as dense as a compact bone. The spongiosa bone is compiled by the cavitas itself which are composed of trabekula plates connected by the canals with tiny spaces of the ireguler with bone marrow. Trabecules and cavitas are set loose and irregular but the structure functions to maximize the strength of the bone, which this structure can adapt to the physical pressure of the bone and is not rigid.

In 196 when he transferred his intellectual skills to Christian subjects, he changed the mindset and literature of churches in the West until as Father of the Church he was named \"The Father of Latin Theology\" or \"The Father of the Latin Church.\" He introduced the term \"Trinity\" (from the same word in Latin) in the Christian vocabulary; as well as possibly, formulating \"One God, Three Persons.\" In his Apologeticus, he was the first Latin writer to declare Christianity a vera religio (? ), and at the same time demeaning the classical religion of the Kingdom and other ways of worship as mere superstition. Earlier, Christian writers commonly used Greek \u25aa a rather flexible and subtle language, which is suitable for philosophy and debate about simple matters. Often, Christians who speak Greek use this way of philosophizing in their beliefs. Although Tertullian, the African-born lawyer, could speak Greek, he chose to write in Latin, and his works reflected the moral and practical elements of a Roman who spoke Latin. This influential lawyer has attracted many authors to his style. While the Greek Christians were still arguing about the divinity of Christ and his relationship with God the Father, Tertullian sought to unite that belief and explain the orthodox position. So he pioneered a formula that we still hold to this day: God is one substance of three individuals.

Although Tertullian questioned \"What business is Athens (filsaphate) with Jerusalem (church)?\" However, Stoa's popular philosophy of the day contributed to his influence. Some say that the idea of sin began with Stoisism, then it was taken over by Tertullian and then into the Western Church. He likely thought that the spirit (the soul) was an object: like the body was formed during conception, so the spirit did. Adam's sin was inherited like a genetic sequence. Western churches listened to this idea, but this idea was not diverted to the East (which had a more optimistic view of human nature). In about 206, Tertullian left the Church to join the moncanis sect. His involvement with Montanism, and because a number of writings near the end of his life were considered against the teachings of the Church, it is likely that Tertullian was never recognized as a saint by the Church, unlike the Fathers of the Church.

In one class, a hollow lobe is called \"epistome\" overhands the mouth.

Each wall is made of mesothelium, and it surrounds a fluid chamber, considered blood. Zooids in the colony are connected, allowing autozooids to share food with each other and with non-eating heterozooids. Connection methods vary between different classes of Briozoa, ranging from large enough gaps in the body walls to small pores where nutrients are passed by funiculi. There's a neural ring around the faring and ganglion that acts as a brain for one side of this. The nerve runs from rings and ganglions to tentacles and throughout the body. Briozoa has no special senses organs, but the silia on the tentacles acts as sensors. Members of the genus Bubble grow toward the sun, and therefore must be able to detect light. In a colony of several species, the signal is sent between zooid through the nerve through the pores on the body wall, and coordinate activities such as eating and withdrawal of the lophoforus. Solitary individuals of Monobryozoon are autozooids with pear-shaped bodies. The wider end has up to 15 short muscle projections, where animals anchor themselves to sand or pebbles and pull themselves up through sediment. Some people use the term avicularia to call the type of zoid which lophofhore is replaced by extensions that serve some protective function, while others limit that term to zooid which maintains the colony by biting attackers and small predators, killing some and biting the dregs of others. In some species the bluff zooid is found in the peduncle, their birdlike appearance is responsible for the term \u25aa Charles Darwin as \"miniature of the head and beak of the vulture, sitting at the neck and able to move.\"",

In another species of avicularia is a zoid like-box stationary placed normally to ataas, so modified operculum locks down against the body wall. In both types of modified operulum are opened by other muscles attached to it, or with internal muscles that raise fluid pressure by attracting flexible membranes. This bluff zooid act is controlled by a small polypide, very modified that lies within the \"mouth\" and bears the fringes of short-sensorial silia. These Zooids appear in various positions: some take place autozooids, some enter into tiny gaps between autozooids, and small avicularia can occur on other zooid surfaces. In the vibracula, considered by some to be some as some kind of avicularia, the operculum is transformed to form long hairs that have a wide range of movements. They can serve as a defense against predators and attackers, or as cleaners. In some species that form moving colonies, the vibracula around the edges is used as feet to dig and walk. The Kenozooid (from the Greek \u25aa\u03bdo\" empty\") consists only of walls of the body and strands of funicular across the interior, and no polypide.

Some species of sea are shaped like a bush or like-pas, supported by \"bats\" and \"prongs\" formed by knobzooids, with autozooids growing from this. This type of colony is generally unmineralized but may have exoskeletons made of kitin. More like small corals, producing heavy limestone skeletons. Many species form colonies made up of autozooid sheets. These sheets can form leaves, fringes or, in the genus Thalmoporeella, a structure that resembles an open head of lettuce.

Some of the encrusting colonies may grow more than 50 centimeters and contain about 2,000,000 zooid. This species generally has exoskeletons that are reinforced with calcium carbonate, and openings through which the lobe stands out are on the upper surface or outer surface. Appearances like the luminaries of encrusting colonies are in charge of this filum. Colonies of large encrusting species often have \"smokes\", gaps in the lofofor canopy, through which they quickly repel filtered water, and thus avoid already exhausted filters of water.

Each colony grows with a sexual bud of a single zooid known as theancestula, which is round, unlike the normal zooid. This happens at the end of a bar or a branch in the form that has this structure. The encrusting colony grows along their edges. In a species with a chalked exoskeleton, it's not mineralized until zooid is fully grown. Colony life spans range from one to about 12 years, and short - lived species pass through several generations in one season. A species that produces defensive zooid does so only when the threat has arisen, and can do so within 48 hours. The \"detainment induced\" theory shows that the production of defense is expensive and that a colony that defends itself is too early or too heavy will have a growth rate and life span reduced. The \"last minute\" approach to defense deserves due to the disappearance of zooid for a single strike may not be significant. Colonies of several encrusting species also produce heterozooids specifically to limit the expansion of other encrusting organisms, especially other brizoas. In some cases this response is more aggressive if the opposition is smaller, which suggests that zooid on the edge of the colony can somehow sense the size of the opponent. Some species are consistent with winning against certain enemies, but most conflicts do not determine and the bridge quickly switch to grow in unassailable areas. The Briozoa that competes for regions does not use the sophisticated techniques used by sponges or corals, perhaps because the short life span of Briozoa makes a major investment in conflict unprofitable.",

In the 1970s, Malaysia began to imitate the economy of the Four Asian Tigers (Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore) and committed to the transformation of economics that depended on mining and agriculture to manufacturing economics. With Japanese investments, heavy industries began to open and several years later, Malaysian exports became the country's primary growth machine for reference. Malaysia consistently received over 7% of GDP growth accompanied by low inflation in the 1980s and 1990s. Basically, Malaysia's growth depends on exporting electronics such as computer chips and so on. As a result, Malaysia felt intense pressure during the economic crisis in 1998 and a decline in the information technology sector in 2001. KDNK in 2001 only increased by 0.3% because of an 11% reduction in export numbers but large fiscal stimulant packages have reduced the impact.",

The main goal was to eliminate race ties to economic functions, and the first five-year plan began to apply the NEP as the Second Malaysia Plan. NEP's glory or failure became a matter of debate, although it officially ended in 1990 and was replaced by National Development Policy (NDP). Recently a lot of debates have arisen once again about the results and relevance of the NEP. Some argue that the NEP was obviously successful in creating the entrepreneurs and professionals of the upper middle-class Malay. Despite some improvements in the general Malay economic strength, the Malaysian government maintains discrimination policies that benefit the Malays over other tribes - including the preoccupation of employment, education, scholarships, commerce, access to cheap homes and assisted savings. This particular treatment triggered jealousy and hatred between non-Melayu and Malay. The Chinese masters of the local economic sector have been handed over a lot to benefit Earth's son/Melayu in many strategic/essential industries such as the distribution of oil derivatives, transportation, agriculture and so on. Most professionals per capita are still dominated by Indians-Malaysia. A fast economic explosion triggers all kinds of supply problems. At least labor is soon filled with the flow of millions of immigrant workers, many of whom are illegal. The PLC rich in cash capital and the consortium of banks soon benefits the increase and speeds up the development of large infrastructure projects. This ended when the financial crisis of Asia 1997 hit in the fall of 1997, sending a big surprise to the Malaysian economy. Like other countries affected by crisis, there is a brief sale of the speculative currency of Malaysia, ringgit. Foreign investments are falling at a dangerous level, as capital evaporates abroad, the value of the ringgit falls from MYR 2.50 per USD to MYR 4.80 per USD.",

After the controversial arrest of the financial minister Anwar Ibrahim, a National Economic Action Council was formed to anticipate the monetary crisis. Malaysia's State Bank determines capital control and sets Malaysia's ringgit exchange rate at 3.80 against U.S. dollars. However, Malaysia rejected economic aid packages from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, an act that shocked foreign analysts. In March, 2005, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) published a paper on Malaysian sources and recovery steps, written by Jomo K.S. From the Applied Economics Department, Malaya University, Kuala Lumpur. The paper concluded that the control determined by the Malaysian government did not exacerbate nor help recovery. The biggest factor is the rise in the number of exports of electronic components, caused by rising demand for components in the United States, caused by concern about the impact of 2000 (Y2K) on older computers and digital devices. However, the post-fading Y2K in 2001 did not affect Malaysia as many other countries. It's a much clearer proof that there are other causes and impacts that might be more compatible with recovery. One possibility is that the currency speculators suffered financial bankruptcy after falling into their assault against Hong Kong dollars in August 1998 and after Russian ruble fell. (See George Soros) Without paying attention to cause and resulting from claims, economic rejuvenation is also rolling with budget deficits and large government spending in the years after the crisis. Then, Malaysia enjoys economic recovery faster than it does its borders. At any rate, in many ways this country hasn't been compromised at a pre-crisis level.",

There are approximately 5 million red blood cells per mm3. The inside of the erythrocyte consists of hemoglobin, a biomolecular that can bind oxygen. Hemoglobin will extract oxygen from the lungs and gills, and oxygen will be released as the erytrophytes pass through the capillaries. The red color of the red blood cells themselves comes from the color hemoglobin that makes iron. In humans, red blood cells are made in the spinal cord, forming biconcaf fragments. Inside the red blood cell there is no nucleus. The red blood cells themselves were active for 120 days before they were destroyed. The red blood cells or also referred to as erythrocytes are derived from Greek, which is erythros means red and kytos meaning eerythrocytes in general consisting of hemoglobin, a complex metalloprotein containing the heme group, where in that heme group, iron atoms will connect temporaryly to oxygen molecules in the lungs and gills, and then this oxygen molecule will be released throughout the body. Oxygen can easily diffusion through the membrane of red blood cells. Hemoglobins in erythrocytes also carry some waste products like CO2 from networks all over the body. Almost the entire CO2 molecule is carried in the form of bicarbonate in the blood plasma. Myoglobin, a compound associated with hemoglobin, acts as an oxygen carrier in the muscle tissue. The color of the erythrocyte comes from the heme group found in hemoglobin. While blood plasma itself is brownish yellow, erythrocytes will change color depending on the hemoglobin condition.",

The method of pressure oxymmetry benefits from this discoloration by measuring oxygen durability in arterial blood by using cholesterol techniques. The reduction of the amount of oxygen carrying proteins in certain cells (than dissolved in body fluids) is an important step in the evolution of vertebrate organisms. This process causes red blood cells to form with low viscosity, high oxygen levels, and better oxygen diffusion from blood cells to body tissue. erythrocytes vary in different species of vertebrates. The width of the erythrocyte is about 25% larger than the diameter of the capillary and has concluded that this increases the oxygen exchange of the erythrocytes and the tissue of the body. The vertebrata known to have no erythrocytes is a Channichthyidae family fish. Fish from Channichtyidae familia live in a cool water environment where high levels of oxygen and oxygen are dissolved in their blood, although they do not use hemoglobin anymore, hemoglobin remains can be found in their genomes. In mammals, adult erythrocytes have no nucleus in them (called anucleate), except in non-specific vertebrata animals such as salamanders of the genus Batraceseps. The questionorbat acid consentranstion inside the erythrocyte cytoplasm is no different from the vitamin C concentration found in the blood plasma.

Erithrocytes also release S-nitrosothiol compounds when hemoglobin is deoxygenated, which also functions to expand blood vessels and launch blood currents in order to get blood to the oxygen-deprived areas of the body. Erithrocytes also play a role in the immune system. When red blood cells are processed by pathogens or bacteria, then the hemoglobin inside the red blood cells releases free radicals that will destroy the walls and membrane cell pathogens, and kill them. At the beginning of its formation, mammal erythrocytes have nuclei, but those nuclei will slowly disappear due to pressure when erythrocytes become mature to give space to the hemoglobin. But so, sometimes it seems crooked on the center of the erythrocyte, where it is sometimes mistaken as a nucleus. For that reason of the absence of the nucleus, blood is also referred to as erythroplastid, although the name erythrocyte is much more common. The mammal's Erithrocytes also lose other organelles such as mitochondria. Thus, erythrocytes never use the oxygen they deliver, but they tend to produce ATP energy carriers through the fermentation process conducted by glycolysis in glucose followed by lactic acid. Furthermore, erythrocytes do not have insulin receptors and glucose fetching on erythrocytes are not controlled by insulin. Because of the absence of nuclei and other organelles, adult erythrocytes don't contain DNA and cannot synthesize RNA, and this makes it impossible for erythrocytes to divide or repair themselves.

Arsenic has a chemical characteristic similar to Phosphorus, and it can often be used as a substitute for biochemical reactions as well as toxic ones. When heated, arsenic will quickly oxidize into arsenic oxide, which smells like garlic. Arsenic and some arsenic compounds can also be directly sublimated, transformed from solid to gas without becoming liquid first. The basic arsenic substance is found in two solid forms of yellow and metallic, with the weight of 1.97 and 5.73. The word arsenic is borrowed from the Persian \u25aa \u25aa \u25aa \u25aa Zarnik which means \"yellow property.\" Zarnik was borrowed in Greek as arsenicon. Arsenic has been known and used in Persia and in many other places since ancient times.

Arsenic is also rubbed in advance and in women's arms to whiten their skin. But it's not very recommended right now. Some places on earth contain a high enough arsen that can seep into ground water.

Most areas with the highest arsen content are alluvial deposits of rivers and soil rich in organic material. It is estimated that some 57 million people drink excess arsen - contaminated ground water, making it potentially toxic. The arsenic in groundwater is natural, and it is released from the sediment into groundwater because of the lack of oxygen in the subsurface layer. This groundwater began to be used after a number of Western NGOs examined a massive wellwater program at the end of the 20th century, but failed to locate arsenic in groundwater. It is estimated to be the worst mass poisoning in history and perhaps the worst environmental disaster in history. In the Banglades there was an epidemic of mass poisoning caused by arsenic.

The signature of Cnidaria is knidocyte, which is the specialized cell they use primarily to catch prey and defend themselves. Their body consists of mesoglea, a jellylike lifeless substance, located between two layers of epitelium that are usually as thick as one cell.

In some species it also has a knidocyte that is used to defeat its struggling prey. Knidocytes are a unique harpoon cell owned by Cnidaria and are made up of three types: The nematosista is made up of an organel knida or cnidosista in the form of a capsule and a scroll of poison, at the end of a thread a hook that can pierce prey. To trigger the shot, the knidocytes have silia or fine hair called knidosil, the last one is the operculum as a clanda cover.

Polip grows to adulthood and then pulls out its tentacles and cuts off its body horizontally, it's called strobilation. The cut section swims free as a young medusa.

Schypozoa can be found in oceans around the world, from surface to deep sea. Schypozoa was not found in fresh water. Schypozoa feeds on such foods as Krustasea or Fish that they hunt using nematosista organelles. Cubozoa is known as the box jellyfish, named after it because it's box-shaped. Cubozoa is faster than any other jellyfish and is also far more dangerous, its members like Chironex fleckeri, Carukia barnesi and Malo kingi are known for its potential and are known as one of the world's most dangerous marine animals, the stings of the animal are capable of causing death to humans.",

Cubozoa is a small size of about two feet [20 JUNI30 cm] but its tentacles can reach three feet [3 m]. Cubozoa can be found in the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic and Indian. Hydrozoa is a diverse group, some are single animals, some are colonies of small animals (zooids) that join to form single animals, most of them live at sea even though some live in fresh water. Colonial polyps are connected by stem - shaped hydroculus and the colony are bound to the base with rootlike stolons, which give a glimpse of the hydrozoa polyps to look like plants. For the most part, small colonies of hydrozoa, but some species such as sifonophorus reach up to a few feet, polyps and hydroculus are protected by proteins called perisarcus. Whereas medusa forms are much smaller than other jellyfish only in diameter of about 0.5 centimeters, although most hydrozoa have a medusa stage, not all of them can swim freely, in some species just act as shoots. A glimpse of hydrozoa medusa is similar to schypozoa. Anthozoa is derived from the Greek anthhoos, which means flowers, most of which resemble flowers. They are a group of members of a polyp with no medusa stage. They reproduce sexually by emitting sperm and eggs that will then become larvae that will grow into new polyps, some that reproduce asexually using shoots.

They are considered to be part of the Schypozoa, but the latest genetic research suggests that they are a separate class. They have the uniqueness of another Cnidaria with no change from the polyp stage to the medusa or otherwise, they look like medusa attached to a polyplike lifestyle, which is why they're called petrified jellyfish. They generally have a horn-like body with stalks to stick in the middle of it. Most of its members were found in the cold waters near the coast. Stauromedusa reproduces sexually by producing eggs or sperm cells that will eventually become larvae that will stick to a suitable place and grow into new staurozoa that attaches, unlike Schypozoa they don't develop strobilation, but they develop directly into mature individuals. Unlike any Cnidaria this animal is a parasite that needs a host to survive. Myxozoa used to be considered protozoa, research continued to take place and eventually they were put into the film Cnidaria. Now Myxozoa is considered to be a derivative of a jellyfish that can live on its own by a free swim that evolved into an obligate parasite that needed a host to complete a microscopic cycle of life made up of only a few cells.

Cnidaria is scattered in the waters around the world, both in fresh water and in the sea. But many of them depend on photosynthetic algae that require sunlight to make nutrients and energy, so they live in shallow waters. The coral formation of the coral is limited in tropical waters. As for staurozoa, it's confined to the cold waters like the North Pole circle. Cnidaria vary in size from microscopic ones like Myxozoa to 6 feet [2 m] in diameter like a lion's shell. Cnidaria prey vary, from plankton to animals that are larger than them like fish and arthropods, this is probably because they have knidocyte weapons. Some cnidaria are parasitic. Some are symbiotic with photosynthetic algae or absorbing nutrients that dissolve in water. Predators from cnidaria include: sea snails that can attach nematosistas to their bodies as self-defense, starfish and kepe-fish that can damage corals, and turtles that eat jellyfish. Some also engage in symbiotic relationships such as sea anemones and clown fish. Coral reefs are one of the most important ecosystems in the world. Cnidaria reef builders come from the class of Anthhozoa and Hydrozoa. Coral reefs are important to humans especially those who live on the beach, because their beaches can be protected from the waves blocked by coral reefs. Coral reefs are a source of income for the people around them, for tourism or for fishing.

He was born in Stridon, a village near Emona, a boundary between Dalmatia and Panonia. He was better known for his translation of the Bible into the Latin he was working on, and his reviews of the Gospels. In addition, he also produced numerous works of writing. Under the protection of Pope Damassus I, Hieronymus appears to be a well - known figure because of his teachings on Christian moral life, especially among cosmopolitan centers like Rome. He often highlighted the women's lives, and wrote down a saying about the proper way of life for a woman who had dedicated herself to Jesus. His great concern for women grew out of a close relationship with his aides, women who came from senators ' families. Hyeronymus was honored as a Saint and a Church poet by the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Lutheran Church, and the Anglican church. The party is celebrated every September 30th. Hieronymus was born in Stridon, about 347 C.E.; he was a citizen of Iliria, and his mother tongue was Iliria. He had just been baptized between 360:366 C.E., after leaving for Rome with his friend Bonosus (perhaps different from Bonosus mentioned by Hieronymus as his friend who became a pave on an island in the Adriatic Sea), to study the science of rhetoricalism and philosophy. He studied with Aelius Donatus, a grammarist who taught him Latin and at least a little Greek, but likely the Greek lesson of Aelius Donatus did not include a profound knowledge of Greek literature that he had accepted while sitting in school.",

Then he stayed for at least a few months, or maybe a few years, with Rufinus in Aquileia where he made friends with many Christians. Some of his friends accompanied him when he traveled about 373 through Trachea and Asia Minor to Northern Syria. In Antioch, where he stayed the longest, two of his traveling companions died and he himself became seriously ill more than once. It was during this illness (about winter of 3734) that she had a vision that told her to put aside worldly studies and dedicate herself to Illahi's things. It seems he was long ago abstained from the classical and conscientious study of the Bible, thanks to the apollinary drive from Laodicea who taught him to be really good at Greek. Because of his keen desire to live in sports, he lived for some time in the Chalcis Desert, the southwest of Antioch, known as Thebaid Syria because most of the hermits living there came from Syria. During that time he still seems to have time to study and write. For the first time he tried to learn Hebrew under the guidance of a Jew who had turned to Christianity; by then apparently he had a relationship with the Jewish Christians in Antioch, and since then he may have been interested in the Hebrew Gospel, which the Jews believe is the source of the canonical Gospel of Matthew.",

Apparently he stayed in the city for two years; the next three years (382-385) he was in Rome again, in close contact with Pope Damass and the Christian community leaders of Rome. His early presence in Rome because he was invited to attend the 382nd synod that was held in order to end the skisma in Antioch, he became very important in the eyes of the Pope and earned an honorable place in his council of advisors. One of the various tasks he was involved in was making a revision of the Latin Bible text into the Greek text - based New Testament and the Old Testament based on the Hebrew text. Before the work of hieronymous translation, the entire translation of the Old Testament was based on the Septuagint. Although opposed by other Christians including Augustine himself, he chose to use the Hebrew Scriptures rather than the Septuagint. The task of translating the Bible into Latin determines the range of years of exposure, and it is the most important achievement that it has achieved. The Bible that it translated from Greek into Latin was called the Vulgar (vulgar) because it spoke the common language, or rough language (vulgar), which was spoken by society at that time.

Shortly after the death of his protector, Pope Damass (December 10, 384), Hieronymus was forced to relinquish his post in Rome after the Roman clergy formed an inquisitor council to investigate the suspicion of an indecent relationship between himself and Paula's widow. In August 385, he returned to Antioch with his brother Paulinianus and some of his friends, and some time later followed by Paula and Eustochium, who had decided to leave the noble neighborhood and spend their life in the Holy Land.

With Bishop Paulinus of Antioch, who joined himself together, these pilgrims visited Jerusalem, Bethlehem, and the holy places of Galilee, and then set out for Egypt, the homes of the heroes of life in uniform. At the School of Katekese Alexandria, Hieronymus listened to a blind catechist, Didymus the Blind, commenting on Hosea's prophet and his memories of St. Antonius the Great, who had died 30 years earlier; he spent some time in Nitria, admiring the regular community life of the many \"city of God\", but found that even in such a place, even though the \"hiding of snakes\" was the influence of the Theology of Origen.

He finished this masterpiece in 405. Before the Vulgate version of Hieronymus, all Latin translations of the Old Testament were based on the Septuagint, not on Hebrew texts. The decision of Hieronymus used the Hebrew text instead of the Greek text of the Septuagint was contrary to the counsel of most other Christians, such as Augustinus, who thought that the Septuagint was divinely inspired. Modern scholars sometimes doubt the quality of the knowledge of Hebrew Hieronymus. Many modern scholars believe that the Greek Hexapla is the main source of the translation \"iuxta Hebraeos\" Hieronymus for the Old Testament. However, careful studies show that to some degree the Hieronymus is a competent Hebrew scholar. Over the next 15 years, until his death, Hieronymus produced a number of comments about the Bible, often explaining his choice of translations in using the Hebrew text rather than the questionable Greek translation. Comment on the Patriciae he made closely in line with Jewish tradition, and he enjoyed using allegorical and mysticism such as Philos and Alexandrian schools. Unlike his peers, he stressed the difference between the apocrypha (apocryphal) Hebrew and Hebrew Bibles and the Hebraica veritas for protocanonic books. In the prologue of the Vulgate, he described a number of parts of the Septuagint that were not found in the Hebrew Bible, for it was considered non - Canonic (he called it apocrypha); he called it the name of the book of Baruch in the part of the \"Principation of Jeremiah\" (Prologue to Jeremiah) and recorded that it was neither read nor stored among the Hebrew Scriptures, but explicitly called it apocryphal or \"not in the canon.\"",

The endoflagela that it has is found on the tip of this bacteria and can have a 2/3 cell length of footing. This bacteria moves by stretching or flexing by taking advantage of the endoflagela rotation. When both endoflageles rotate in the same direction and the protoplasma cylinder moves in the opposite direction then the spirochetes cells can move or move. According to habitats, pathogenic, philogenic, and morphological and physiological properties, the spirochetes can be distinguished into 8 genus. Spirochaeta has anaerobics and faerobative aerobatives and can live freely in academic environments such as water and river mud, lakes, oceans, and ponds.

The species of T. saccharophilum can live on a ruminansian digestive organ of anaerobic rummen. These bacteria play a role in the conversion of plant polycacidal acids into volatile fatty acids as a source of ruminansia animal energy. T.

These two genus are made up of aerobic bacteria that use long chain fat acids, such as oleic acid as a source of carbon and electron donors. Leptospira characteristics are thin, wrapped around, and usually one end bends into a hook. Rodensia, dogs, and pigs are some of the natural hosts of leptoira. The example of Leptospira is L. biflexa which is free cells and L. Interrogants that are parasitic microorganisms.

Even the use of trigonometry in mathematics is related to buildings thought to have been used in ancient Egypt in building pyramids. At first, man used only what was in nature as a means, and infrastructure and infrastructure in his life. For example, the use of caves as a home. Then human civilization evolved by utilizing what was in nature, such as rock, soil, and wood, as raw materials to create an infrastructure. In the next time, civilizations developed again with the invention of mine materials that could be used to make tools and objects that would sustain a building, like metal goods, and to process natural materials like limestone, sand, and soil.",

The first category of acid is proton donor or Br\u00f8nsted acid. In special cases in water solution, proton donors form H3O+ hydronium ions and are known as arrhenius acids. Br\u00f8nsted and Lowry formulate arrhenius theory to include solvents instead of water. Both the Br\u00f8nsted and the Arrhenius acid usually have hydrogen atoms attached to chemical structures that remain energetically active after the loss of H+. Arrhenius acid in a water solution has a characteristic that provides a practical description of acid. The acid forms a watery solution with a surly flavor, can turn the blue lactus into red, and react with bases and various metals (like calcium) into salt. The word acid comes from the Latin acidus/ac The watery solution of acid has less than 7 and this solution is also called 'asam' in everyday context (as in phrase 'soluted in acid'), while the strict definition of acid only refers to the solute. The lower pH means having higher acidity, and also having higher concentration of positive hydrogen ions in the solution. Watery acids common among them are chloride acids (solute of hydrogen chloride found in stomach acid and can activate digestive enzymes), acetic acids (cucas are a watery solution of this fluid), sulfuric acid (used in car batteries), and citric acid (discovered in the citrus fruit). According to this example, acid (in general view) can be either a solution or a pure chemical, and can be derived from solid, liquid, or gas acid (in tight view) acid.",

The second category of acid is Lewis acid, which forms covalent bonds with the electron pair. One is boron trifluoride (BF3) with an empty boron atom that can form a covalent bond through the division of the electron pairs in the atoms in the base compound, as an example of nitrogen atoms in ammonia (NH3). Lewis considers this theory as a generalized definition of Br\u00f8nsted so acid is a chemical species that accepts electron pairs both directly and through the release of protons (H+) into solution, which then accepts electron pairs. However, hydrogen chloride, acetic acid, and most of the other Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry acids cannot form covalent bonds with an electron pair so it's not Lewis acid. On the contrary, much of Lewisic acid does not include either Arrhenius and Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry acid. In modern terminology, acid is implicitly referred to Br\u00f8nsted acid instead of Lewis acid, since chemists almost always refer to Lewis acid explicitly as Lewisic acid. The term \"asam\" is a translation of the term used for the same thing in European languages such as acid (English), zuur (Dutch), or S\u00e4ure (Russian) which is literally related to the taste of sursim. In chemistry, the term acid has a more special meaning. There are three definitions of acid that are commonly accepted in chemistry, which are the definitions of Arrhenius, Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry, and Lewis. Although it is not the most extensive theory, the Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry definition is the most common definition. In this definition, the acidity of a compound is determined by the stability of hydronium ions and the conjugated conjugate base when the compound has given protons into the solution where the acid is located.",

Here is the strong acidity level of the most powerful acidicity of the most acidicity: strong acids include halidic acid \u25aa HCl, HBr, and HI. (But fluoride acid, HF, is relatively weak.) The oxo acids, which generally contain high oxidation atoms surrounded by oxygen, are also quite powerful; including HNO3, H2SO4, and HClO4. The weak acid has a small Ka value (that is, a considerable amount of HA and A-is present together in the solution; a small amount of H3O+ is in the solution; the acid only unravels in part). For example, Ka's value for acetate acid is 1.8 \u00d7 10,5. Most organic acids are weak acids. The weak acids and the salts from the conjugate base form a buffer solution. About 1800, many French chemists, including Antoine Lavoisier, mistakenly believed that all acids contained oxygen.

A number of celebrations are held such as theater shows, poetry readings, parades, and so forth. As for the broad menu, the Muslims there eat lamb mixed with traditional rice and vegetables. This is also true in Sudan, Syria, and several other Middle Eastern countries. In China, exactly in Xinjiang, the celebrations of the broads appear to be jubilant. Men wore distinctive suits and white coffers, while women wore warm clothes and half - caps. After Id's prayer, a feast and a cross - law event was performed. The width of Iran lacks splendor. This is because the majority of the Muslims there are followers of Shiah. After the Idulfitri prayer at the mosque or in the field, they simply proceed with a family syllaturahmi event and close with a feeding event from the wealthy family to the underprivileged. In Europe, the Idulfitri celebration was not done with such splendor. In Britain, for example, it is not commemorated as a national holiday. The Muslims in England had to look for information about Idulfitri day. Usually, this information is obtained from the nearest Islamic Centre or from the Islamic mailing list. Idulfitri was celebrated in a simple manner in England. The sermon was delivered by the local mosque priest, followed by embroidering. Usually in one area where there are many muslims there, offices and schools in the region will give a day off to Muslims. To determine the day of the Idulfitri itself, scholars and scholars of Islam often set accounts and cuts to determine the Idulfitri holiday. In Turkey, Idulfitri is known as Bayram (from Turkish). Usually everyone would say \"Bayram\u0131n\u0131z Kutlu Olsun,\" \"Mutlu Bayramlar,\" or \"Bayram\u0131n\u0131z M\u00fcbarek Olsun\".",

Small children also go to houses around the neighborhood to say hello, where they are usually given sweets, chocolates, traditional sweets like Baklava and Lokum, or a small amount of money. Muslims in North America in general celebrated Idulfitri in a calm and solemn way. Since the establishment of the holiday depends on a month's review, often many people do not realize that the next day is Idulfitri. People used different methods to determine the end of Ramadan and the beginning of Nawal. North Americans in the eastern region may celebrate Idulfitri on a different day than those in the western region. In general, the end of Ramadan was announced by email, website, or telephone connection. Generally, the Muslim family in the West will wake up very early to prepare a small meal. Everyone is encouraged to dress formal and new. Many families wear traditional clothes from their country, because most Muslims there are immigrants. Then they will go to the nearest assembly to pray. They can be held in local mosques, hotel meetings, arenas, or local stadiums. The Idulfitri Salat is very important, and Muslims are encouraged to pray for forgiveness and reward. After prayer, there are sermons where the priest advises the congregation and usually encourages it to end any hatred or past mistakes they may have had.",

That's why Islamicists strongly oppose secularism that calls for separation between religion and politics. Supporters of Islam can have a different interpretation of verses and letters in the Quran. The view of Islam emphasizes the importance of Sharia; Pan-Islamism's political union; as well as selectively ridding the non-Muslim influences of the Islamic world, particularly political, social, economic, and Western cultures that are considered to be incompatible with Islam. Some observers like Graham Fuller, argue that the teachings of Islamism are not as hard and tight as expected, and can be defined as a political form of identity, or support of Muslim identity, authenticity, broader regionalism, reanimation, and revitalization of Muslim communities. After the rise of the Arab world, Islamic politics was described as \"a growing interdependent\" by democratic politics. Muslimists generally oppose the use of this content, and claim that this political attitude and ideals are a form of their only Islamic expression.

One of the great divides in Islamism is that Graham E. Fuller described between \"the guardian of tradition\" and \"the founder of change and reform of Islam\" is centered on the Muslim Islamic Ikhwanul movement. Olivier Roy argued that the \"Pan-Islamism Sunni had a major shift in the second half of the 20th century\" movement when the Ikhwanul Muslimin movement focused on the Islamization of the Pan-Arabism movement was overtaken and defeated by the Salafi movement that stressed on \"saliah instead of building Islamic pranatas,\" and the rejection of Islamic Shiah.

As a nation with the largest Islamic population in the world, the development of Islamism can be traced from the history of Islamic development in Indonesia. The most widely accepted opinion is Islam's entry in the 7th century to the 11th century. Since then, Islam has been deeply accepted by Indonesian society, especially because there are some spiritual similarities between Islam and local beliefs in some places. Along with the Westerners who then embarked on a mission to spread Christian teachings, came power struggles in their own way for ideological purposes. Conflicts with religious names arose. Many of them have also raised issues of mastering economic resources, changing cultural currents, to national zeal. It replicated in the times in which the spirit of Islamism began to take root strongly in Indonesia, that is when Islamic teachings, especially Quran and Hadis, experienced political interpretations. The influence of Islamism is strong enough to be used as a resistance to the invaders, as well as to the ideologies brought on by modernism and capitalism. This long history leaves a trail that can be seen to date so that political interpretations are being made against the West and Secularism. In 1901 to 1942, political ethics was an important transition in Indonesia because it was judged to be able to fight for some of the rights of indigenous people to prosper.

Understand this focuses on free markets and free trade knocking down obstacles to international trade and investments so that all countries can benefit from increasing the standard of living society or the people of a country and modernization through increased commercial efficiency and the flow of investment. In foreign policy, neoliberalism is closely linked to the opening of foreign markets through political means, using economic pressure, diplomacy, and/or military intervention. Market openings refer to free trade. Neoliberalism is generally associated with multilateral political pressure, through commercial management cartels such as the WTO and the World Bank. This resulted in a decrease in government authority to a minimum. Neoliberalism through the free market economy has successfully suppressed government intervention (as Keynesianism knows), and has made a success of its overall economic growth. To increase corporate efficiency, neoliberalism strives to reject or reduce labor rights policies like minimum wage, and other collective bargaining rights. Neoliberalism runs counter to socialism, protechism, and environmentalism. domestically, it's not directly against principle with potexionism, but sometimes using this as a bargaining chip to persuade other countries to open the market.

Capitalism boasts of freedom like this as the very essence of its creation. And on its way, capitalism always adjusts and maintains that freedom. For example the problem of labor, according to capitalist conception, all government decisions or public demands are irrelevant. Then understand what's made for liberals is freedom, which means: there are a number of people who are going to win and a number of people are going to lose. This victory and defeat is due to competition. Whether you are of value to others, or whether others will gladly give something to you. So freedom will be defined as having rights and being able to use those rights by reducing the interference of the other side's rules. \"We have the right to run our own lives\" Right now, economists like Friedrich von Hayek and Milton Friedman are repeating the classic arguments of Adam Smith and JS Milton, stating that the market society is a free and productive society. Work capitalism results in dynamicity, opportunity, and competition. The interests and personal advantages are the motors that encourage people to move dynamically. From the time of the destruction of Wall Street (known to the Great Depression or Great Depression) to the early 1970s, the country's advanced discourses were still 'overpowered' by democratic social political discourses with welfare arguments.

This understanding is what came to be called \"Neoliberalism.\" This neoliberal economic understanding developed by the theory of neoliberal economic ideas that has been perfected by the Chicago Mazhab that was pioneered by Milton Friedman. Neoliberalism aims to restore trust to market power, with justification referring to freedom. As in the case of wages for workers, in understanding government neoliberalism has no right to interfere in the decision of labor or in the problems of full labor this is the business between the business owner and the worker. The main pusher of the power of market power is the privatization of economic activities, especially in the industrial businesses that the government has. But this privatization doesn't happen in big capitalist countries, it actually happens in South American countries and other poor developing countries. It has defeated the long process of nationalization that became the key to welfare-based countries. The nationalization that inhibits business activities must be abolished. This neoliberalism revolution meant a change in economic management based on supplies to demand based. So according to the Neoliberals, a low inflation and high unemployment economy, is still better than high inflation with low unemployment. The government's job is to create an environment so that capital can move freely.

There's no area of life that can't be a commodity of selling goods. The spirit of neoliberalism is seeing the entire life as a source of corporate profit. For example, with water resources sectors, the liberalization program of water resources whose implementation is associated with the World Bank's watsal scheme or water resources sector loan adjustment. Water has to be judged as economically manageable as it does economically. The social dimension in public resources is reduced to a mere economic commodity. The right to mastery or concession to this water source can be transferred from owner to owner, from corporation to corporation, through the mechanism of sale. The arrangement system, along with the rights of this water source, will gradually be diverted to an entity shaped like a business corporation or a corporate business owned by governments or national private companies or private companies or even multinational companies and transnational companies. One advantage of neoliberalism is offering simple political thinking, offering political simplification so that at a certain point politics no longer has any meaning other than what is defined by markets and entrepreneurs.

In 1956, Israel joined a secret alliance together with Great Britain and France, which aims to reclaim the previously nationalized Suez Canal (See the Suez Crisis). Although successfully captured the Sinai Peninsula, Israel was forced to withdraw from the pressure of the United States and the Soviet Union in exchange for the assurance of Israel's shipping rights at the Red Sea and the Suez Canal. At the beginning of the next decade, Israel was able to capture and bring Adolf Eichmann to justice, a major founder of the Final Solutions hiding in Argentina. This court had a strong influence on public concern for the Holocaust, and to this day Eichmann was the only person executed by Israel even though John Demjanjuk was also sentenced to death before the verdict was reversed by Israel's Supreme Court.

In 1967, Egypt, Syria, and Jordan closed its borders with Israel and drove the UN peace forces out of the region and blocked Israel's access to the Red Sea. Israel then launched an attack on the Egyptian air force base for fear of an invasion by Egypt. This led to the Six - Day War that Israel later won. During this war, Israel succeeded in taking the West Bank, the Gaza Line, the Sinai Peninsula, and the Golan Plateau. The Green Line marks a boundary between Israel's administration and the territory of Israel's occupation. The border of Jerusalem was also expanded by entering the region of Eastern Jerusalem. A law that passed this region's income was then set.",
