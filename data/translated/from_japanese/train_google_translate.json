        "paragraph": "Inductors (English: Inductor, induction coil) are passive elements that can store energy in magnetic fields formed by flowing current, and are generally made of coils and are often called coils, and both are both in this article.Use how to call it.The amount of magnetic energy stored is determined by its inductance, and the unit is Henry (H).Generally, the wire is wound, and by winding it many times, the magnetic field in the coil becomes stronger according to the ampel's law.In accordance with the laws of Faraday's electromagnetic induction, induced electromotive force occurs in proportion to the change in magnetic fields in the coil, and the induction current flows in the direction of the magnetic field change in accordance with the lens law.The inductor has the ability to delay and re -form the AC current, and is a basic part of the electric circuit that changes the voltage and current over time.In English, it is also called \"chalk\", but this is a word that comes from the application (chalk coil).It is shown in L in mathematical formula and circuit diagram.L is believed to be derived from the Lenz's law, Heinrich Lenz.The wire of the coil of the power equipment for using the electromagnetic induction and the magnetic force lines is called a winding line.",
