It has a population of about 1.4 million and is the fourth largest in Iran. There are various theories as to when the city was built, and its history can be traced back to the Sasanids at least in the third century. The name Tauris is derived from the name Tauris after King Tiridates III of Armenia in 297. The Arab Muslims then invaded. It was rebuilt by one of the wives of the 8th century Abbasid caliphate Harrune al-Lasede. After the late 13th century following the Mongol invasion, it was designated as the capital of the Ilhan dynasty (Il-Han Province) by Argun, and a new wall was built. Altai languages, not Persian, spread to Tabriz and Azerbaijan. Afterwards, it became the capital of the Black Lamb dynasty (Kara Koyunl dynasty) from 1375, but was attacked by Timur in 1392. In 1469, it became the capital of the White Lamb dynasty (Ak Koyunl dynasty) after the Black Lamb dynasty. In addition, Ismail I, who destroyed the White Lamb dynasty, entered Tabley's in 1501, and the Safavid dynasty remained the capital until his transfer to Gazvine in 1548. In 1514, after the Battle of Chardir\u00e1n, he experienced a temporary occupation of the Ottoman Empire. The conflict with the Ottoman Empire continued, and from 1585 to 1603 it was again ruled by the Ottoman Empire, and after it was restored to the Safavid Empire, it began to develop as a trading city. It was again occupied in 1724. In 1826, the Russians took over the city, and in 1828, the prince's palace was built. In the 20th century, it became the center of the Iranian Constitutional Revolution from 1905 to 1911. After World War II, the Soviet Union established the Azerbaijani National Government in northwestern Iran (1946) and the capital was established in Tabriz, but the Soviets soon withdrew and Tabriz returned to Iran. It is an active area of earthquake activity, and there are not many historical sites left. The Ilhanian period, the remains of the fortifications built in the early 13th century, such as the Arge Tabriz and the Maggiede Cabudo (Blue Mosque), are famous. It is about 600 km from Tehran.",

It had the highest kokudaka in the domain in Shinano Province. He lived in Matsushiro-jo Castle in Nagano City, Nagano Prefecture and owned Kawanakajima four counties. The lords of the domain were the Sakai family (Saemon no jo [third-ranked officer of the Left Division of Outer Palace Guards]), the Echizen Matsudaira family, and the Sanada family. This section also describes the Kawanakajima Domain which ruled the same territory although the castle area was different. It is said that it was unified into 'Matsushiro' (Matsushiro) in the Hoei era because there was a document that it was called 'Matsushiro' (Matsushiro) in ancient times, but in this manuscript it was unified into 'Matsushiro' (Matsushiro) for convenience. Kawanakajima Shigun refers to four counties in the northern part of Shinano Province: Takai County (present Kamitakai County, Shimotakai County and Nakano City, Suzaka City), Mizuuchi County (present Kamimizuuchi County, Shimomizuuchi County, Iiyama City, Nagano City), and Kokyu County and Oshina County (including Chikuma City). It was the place where the Takeda clan and the Uesugi clan fought in the Battle of Kawanakajima during the Sengoku period (period of warring states), and it corresponds to the present Kitanobu region. However, the center of control over the region of Kitanobu was located in Kaizu-jo Castle (Matsushiro-jo Castle) where Shingen TAKEDA ordered Kansuke YAMAMOTO to build the castle in preparation for the battle against Kenshin UESUGI. The establishment of the feudal lord's territory in the early modern period started when Tadamasa MORI entered Kawanaka-jima Island with 137,000 koku after the Battle of Sekigahara. Tadamasa worked to convert Kawanakajima's territory into a territory, and a thorough land survey called 'Ukonkenchi' resulted in a whole territory uprising, but this was completely destroyed. In 1603, he was transferred to Kazukuni, Mimasaka Province (Tsuyama Domain). It is said that Kaizu-jo Castle was renamed 'Waiting Castle' during the reign of Tadamasa. After that, Tadateru MATSUDAIRA, the sixth son of Ieyasu TOKUGAWA, held 140,000 koku (crop yields) for seven years until he moved to the Takada Domain in Echigo Province, and even after he was transferred to Takada, his former territory was included in the new territory, and he knew it until 1616, when he was deprived of his territory. The period of ownership of these two families is generally called Kawanakajima Domain. During the period during which Tadateru's territory was owned, the chief retainer Yoshinari KANOI ruled as the lord of the castle and made efforts to maintain the territory, and therefore, Kanai-jinja Shrine was built to honor his achievements.",

Poros had hoped for reinforcements from his allies, but Avisares remained in power throughout almost all of the Macedonian invasions. Poros continued to fight on elephants until the end, even after the soldiers fell one after another, so Alexander was impressed by his courage and encouraged him to surrender. According to Allianos, Alexander initially made Thaksirez an envoy, but Poros did not respond, so he sent several Recommendations, and finally succeeded in convincing Poros' old friend Meloes. Some modern Indian researchers have identified the meloes with the later Chandragupta Maurya, but the evidence is very weak. When asked about Alexander's wish to be treated, Poros replied, \"Take care of him as king.\" When Alexander asked more questions, he said, \"Everything is included in this answer.\" Alexander paid homage to his courage and pride, and treated him as a friend, resting all his lands. Poros then worked as an important ally of Alexandrus to subjugate the area to the Hypasis River (now the Beer's River) and was given the entire area after Alexander's withdrawal. Aleksandros's intermediary led to a peace treaty with Taxiles. Shortly after Alexander's delegation to the Indus region, Philip, was killed in an uprising, Alexander sent letters to Eudamos and Taxiles, local governors left in India, and ordered them to cooperate and govern the area until they were appointed as official governors. However, after Alexander's sudden death in 323 BC, Diadoquois, who fought for the rule of the Empire, turned to Asia Minor and Asia Secondary, where it was the main battlefield, and the remote Indian region was abandoned, so the rule of Eudamos and Thaksirez continued to be an established fact. In 316 BC, Governor Sind and nominally senior Eudamos and Taxiles Peyton withdrew from the east coast of Indus, making the situation of Panjab almost unknown. It is not known after Poros. According to Diodorus of Sicily, Eudamos, who left India to join Eumenes in 317 BC, killed Poros and obtained his territory and army (Diodorus of Sicily, XIX, 14).",

Poros is the title of the king of this tribe, and the name of the so-called king of Poros is not known. He was an influential ruler of the eastern part of Panjab, but was defeated by Alexander III in the Battle of the Hydaspes River in 326 BC. According to Greek sources, at the time of Alexander's invasion into the northwestern part of India in 327 BC, there were three major figures in the area. One was a new chief, Taxiles (Hindi: Ambhi Ambbi), who took over the kingdom of Taxilla upstream of the Indus River from his father, the other was King Avisares, who ruled the Kashmir region, and the other was King Poros of the eastern Panjab. At the time, Poros' territory was in a fertile area from one of the tributaries of the Indus River, the Hydaspes River (now the Jerum River) to the Aquesin\u00e9s River (now the Shenab River), and according to Greek records, it was able to mobilize 4,000 cavalry, 50,000 infantry, 300 tanks, and 200 war elephants. It is said that Poros himself was a huge warrior who exceeded 2 meters in height and was not brave. Poros had been fighting against the king of Taxilla for many years. Knowing that Taxilla's new chief, Taxiles, had soon surrendered to Alexandrus, he decided to join Kashmir's Avisares to fight against the Macedonian army and block Alexander's invasions on the Hydaspes River on the western border of the territory. Around the beginning of the summer of 326 BC, Alexander reached the Hydaspes River with Taxiles and other Indian allies. Alexander found out on the other side that a large army led by Poros was waiting for the Macedonian army, so he took his army to the riverside to explore the warplane. Because it was dangerous to force the crossing from the front, Alexander used his cavalry to carry out a clear battle every night, waiting for Poros's army to be tired of responding, leading a small number of elite cavalry upriver on a stormy night, and secretly crossing the river. Poros soon noticed this and sent one of his sons to intercept, but the platoon was crushed by Alexander.",

In English, it is referred to as the Ottoman Empire. In the 15th century, it destroyed the Eastern Roman Empire and conquered its capital, Constantinople (later Istanbul), which became its own capital. The largest version of the 17th century expanded significantly from the Middle East to Africa and Europe. East-west from Azerbaijan to Morocco, and north-south from Yemen to Ukraine and Hungary. The Ottoman Empire, an Islamic dynasty developed from the Principality in the corner of Anatolia, eventually conquered Eastern European Christian states, such as the Eastern Roman Empire, and the Mamlukian West Asian and North African Muslim countries, to become the Ottoman Empire, a world empire that overthrows the vast majority of the Mediterranean world. Its appearance was a \"osmanian shock\" for the Western Christian world, and its influence was significant from the 15th to the 16th century. It also had an indirect influence on religious reform, and was a major source of disappointment for the Western unity of the Holy Roman Empire and the dream of building a Catholic world empire. The Holy Roman Empire was threatened by the \"Turkey Threat\", and the \"Turkey Tax\" was newly established, and it was transferred from the medieval feudal system to absolute monarchy, which served as a promotional agent. When Peter I began to oppress the Ottoman Empire, the Holy Romans supported the Romanocean and brought the line south. In the mid-19th century, the British and French were able to divide their prints on a Mediterranean scale. From the end of the century when the Ottoman Debt Administration was established, the German Empire developed Anatolia, the territory that remained until the end. For this reason, the Ottoman Empire joined the First World War as a central ally, but was defeated. Since the Treaty of Sabre, a peace treaty after the defeat, was a powerful dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, the opposition forces established a republican government in Ankara, in 1922 declared the abolition of the Ottoman Sultan system, and Mehmet VI fled. In 1923, the Ankara government declared the establishment of the Republic of Turkey, and in 1924, the Ottoman caliphate system was abolished.",

After more than 20 years (as of 2004), IUPAC recommendations are often ignored, and there is confusion in the presence of two different configurations in the database of chemical thermodynamics. CODATA, which publishes recommendations for various physical constants, makes the latter SSP according to IUPAC's recommendations, but the ideal gas molecule and soccer tetroad constants that depend on the setting of the standard pressure are based on both 105 and 101 325 Pa standard pressures. The IUPAC's recommendation to change the SSP was accompanied by a change in the unit, but the standard state is a (virtual) measurement condition, a choice of the standard amount, not a choice of the unit. The physics theory does not depend on the choice of units, but, for example, the standard generation enthalpy depends on the setting of the standard state and changes its quantity (not the numerical change due to the change in units). Note that 105 Pa is not a consistent unit along the SI in the first place. The standard temperature is often 25 \u00b0C or 0 \u00b0C. Standard conditions for temperature and pressure are SATP, STP, and NTP. The conditions under which gas is used as a standard state vary from region to region. According to Atkins Physicochemistry, as of 2016, SATP of 25 \u00b0C, 105 Pa is used, but STP of 0 \u00b0C, 1 atm is still used. According to Ball Physicochemistry, the STP of 0 \u00b0C, 105 Pa is the most common set. In Japan, the standard state is usually 0 \u00b0C or 1 atm NTP.

How to set a standard state is completely artificial, and although there is no theoretical proof, historically it is based on human natural recognition. In general, it refers to the standard state of a gas, which is indicated by specifying pressure and temperature. Depending on the field of science, as well as by academic societies and international standards organizations, their definitions vary and there is confusion. For this reason, the Japan Thermal Measurement Society has been conducting enlightenment activities claiming that standard atmospheric pressure (1 atm = 101325 Pa), which is the standard pressure of the Earth's atmosphere, should be used as a unified value. The specified pressure is called standard pressure. It is often written as p\u00b0 with a symbol of \u00b0 to indicate that it is a standard pressure. Since any pressure can be specified as p\u00b0, it must be specified what pressure should be specified as p\u00b0. There are two main types of standard pressure settings. One has historically been the standard atmospheric pressure p:=1 atm=101 325 Pa{\\displaystyle p^{\\circ }:=1\\ {\\text{atm}}=101\\ 325\\ {\\text{Pa}}} and the other is the p:=105 Pa{\\displaystyle p^{\\circ }:=10^{5}\\ {\\text{Pa}}} recommended by IUPAC in 1982. The 105 Pa is a standard-state pressure (SSP). Prior to 1982, the standard atmospheric pressure 101 325 Pa was SSP. SSP is the pressure used to define the \"standard state of a substance\" described below, and does not impede the use of other standard pressures. For example, the boiling point of the substance in the database is usually the normal boiling point under the standard atmospheric pressure. After the adoption of the International System of Units (SI) in 1960, the IUPAC published the Green book in 1969 and converted it to SI.",

It is also known today as classical music, as well as practical music that has not been created purely for ornamental purposes, such as classical ceremonial music and Romantic Winnawalds. The main period categories are shown below. The term \"classical music\" was not used until at least the 19th century. At that time, the attempt by Johann Sebastian Bach to revive the music of the era of Ludwig van Beethoven led to the distinction of classical music from others. It was first mentioned in the Oxford English Dictionary in 1836 in classical music. Around the 6th century, Christian chant Gregorian chant and polyphonic music were born. This is the beginning of medieval Western music. Around the 9th century, Gregorian chant began to be written in neumas. This led to the establishment of renaissance music in the Burgundy region of France in the 15th century. In the 16th century, the development of full-fledged instrumental music and the birth of opera flourished in the court music (Baroque music). Earlier music is often referred to as early music. After that, in the mid-18th century, music spread to the public, and it developed into music that focused on 'form' and 'wagi' called classical music. Around this time, music became generally seen as art. In the 19th century, the movement shifted to romantic music with an emphasis on expression, and national music schools incorporating folk songs from various countries were born. Around the 20th century, modern music such as impressionist music expressed in \"mood\" and \"environment\" and music that eliminated the regulation of harmony and tone were born, and after World War II, it developed into free music called modern music.",

In addition, New York is the most billionaire city in the world, and their investment activities have had a tremendous impact on the global economy. In 1524, the Italian explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano, who was ordered by the King of France, arrived in the area and called it Nouvelle Angoulme. At that time, there were about 5,000 Lenape Indians residing there. European settlement began in 1614 when the Dutch built a colony at the southern end of Manhattan for the purpose of fur trade, which later became known as New Amsterdam. In 1626, the Dutch colonial governor Peter Minuit replaced Manhattan with 60 guilders (about $1,000 as of 2006) of goods from the Lenapes.",

The city has a population of over 8 million and, according to its definition, more than 20 million people. In 2015, the city's gross production was $66.25 billion, the largest in the United States. Together with London, it is the highest global city and financial center. It is also the headquarters of the United Nations, and is known as the center of the world in multiple fields because it has a great influence on the world's politics, economy, culture, fashion and entertainment. Kanji is an acronym for Tsunabu City, Tsunagi City, etc. New York City faces the Atlantic Ocean in the northeastern United States and has a large port of New York. The city is divided into five administrative districts: Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island. As of the 2010 census, the city's population was 8,175,133, with a land area of 790 km2 and a population density of 2nd among major U.S. cities. The population of the New York metropolitan area is also the largest in the country, with 1,887,109 metropolitan areas, including Newark, Jersey City, New Jersey, Yorkers, New Rochelle, and Long Island on the mainland, across the Hudson River, and 2,2085,649 urban areas, including Stanford, Bridgeport, Connecticut, Trenton, New Haven, and Poquipsy, New Jersey. Public transportation is widely used in cities in the United States, with many public transportation services operating 24 hours a day. The high density of the population and its diversity are also remarkable. According to a 2005 survey, nearly 170 languages were spoken in the city, with 36% of the population being born outside the United States. New York is also known as a sleepless city, with other nicknames such as \"Big Apple\" and \"Gotham\". New York was built in 1624 as a trading ground by the Dutch.

With the 1978 Constitution of Spain, the state of Basque gained strong autonomy in Spain. The province of Basque is based on the Gernica Charter (Basque Autonomy Charter, a basic legal document providing a framework for the development of the Basque people living in Spanish Basque), but the province of Navarra, where many Basques live, was excluded from the province of Basque and became the state of Navarra alone.

Due to the laws and regulations of samurai families, daimyo (Japanese feudal lords) were strictly controlled, and large daimyo (Japanese feudal lords) were also punished by the deprivation of their power and often lost their territory. Important offices throughout the country such as Kyoto, Osaka, and Nagasaki did not have daimyo (feudal lords) as direct control territories (tenryo), and government officials of the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) ruled them. The Imperial Court was controlled by Kinchu nami kuge shohatto and Kyoto shoshidai, and it became impossible to take independent external actions. In addition, due to the introduction of peace, a large number of soldiers (samurai) changed from non-productive military activities to administrative activities, and extensive development of new rice fields was carried out in various places, so the economy, which had continued to grow for a long time from the Sengoku period to the Azuchi-Momoyama period, developed explosively and the period of high-growth began. In the Edo period, other than exchanges with China (Ming and Qing) and the Netherlands in Dejima, Nagasaki, and exchanges with Yi Dynasty Korea through the Tsushima Domain, they took a national isolation policy that prohibited exchanges with foreign countries (however, there were actual trades between China and the Ryukyu Kingdom controlled by Satsuma and the Matsumae clan on the Toshima Peninsula). It is said that the banishment order of Bateren was already issued by Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI, but it was the Shimabara War that directly triggered the national isolation, and it is said that it was because the danger of Christianity was strongly recognized because it was difficult to suppress it due to the link between Christianity and uprisings (which had an intermediate character between the kokujin uprising in the medieval period and the peasant uprising in the early modern period). It was also influenced by the fact that the Netherlands advised the bakufu that it was intended to colonize Japan in Catholic countries such as Spain and that it was dangerous for the Dutch to monopolize Japanese trade. In China, the same policy was called maritime banning policy, but in China, the purpose was to protect against pirates including Wako (Japanese pirates) in the coastal areas and to prohibit smuggling on the sea, and the situation was different from that of Japan's isolation. However, there is a view that Japan's maritime ban is more appropriate than that of China's maritime ban.",

The period in Japanese history is considered to be 'modern times' in combination with the Azuchi and Momoyama periods (or the period of the Toyotomi government). During the Edo period, Ieyasu TOKUGAWA was appointed Seii taishogun (literally, \"great general who subdues the barbarians\") on March 24, 1603 and established the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) in Edo (present-day Tokyo); however, during the period of 265 years, it was changed from Keio to Meiji due to the promulgation of 'Ichisei Ippon' on October 23, 1868. However, there is a view that the end of the period was on November 9, 1867, when Perry came to Japan in 1853 and the Sakuradamongai Incident, and on November 14, 1867, when Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA submitted Taisei Hokan to Emperor Meiji, and on January 3, 1868, when the Meiji government was declared to be established by the Decree of the Restoration of Imperial Rule, and on May 11, 1868, when Edo was opened, or on April 11, 1871, when Haihan-chiken (abolition of feudal domains and establishment of prefectures) was enforced. (1603 - 1710) When Ieyasu TOKUGAWA became Seii Taishogun (literally, \"great general who subdues the barbarians\"), he established the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) in Edo, where the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) was born. After Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI's death, he became confused with the administration, focused on the promotion of industry and education, and other measures, as well as eradicating the power of the Toyotomi clan by the Osaka no Jin (the Siege of Osaka). After that, the Shimabara War was suppressed, and political uneasiness, which lasted almost 700 years since the Heian period, came to an end. After that, he established the foundation of a long-term stable government that lasted more than 200 years, and the state of peace called 'Genwa Kanmu' was brought to Japan. The system of operation of the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) at the time of its establishment was based on the family government of the Tokugawa family, which was described as 'the tailoring of a manor'; however, a system that continued until the end of the Edo period, such as 'Roju' and 'Wakadoshiyori,' was established around 1665. Some daimyo, who were once colleagues of Ieyasu TOKUGAWA and the Toyotomi government, were treated as tozama daimyo and had a vast territory, but they were distanced from important places such as the Kanto region and the Kinki region, and they were no longer involved in the shogunate government like the previous samurai government.",

However, with the support of the powerful aristocrats who had been sacrificed by Edward's aggressive expansion, the Duke of Gloucester abdicated Edward V and himself became King Richard III of England, ending the Gokokukyo in a short period of time. For the fourth time, Edward VI of the Tudor dynasty was a child, so his maternal uncle Edward Seymour, Earl of Hartford, took office in 1547 and was conferred the title of Duke of Somerset. The Duke of Somerset promoted the Reformation of England, established various policies, and supported the Protestantization, but failed to deal with diplomacy and the peasant revolt, which was attached to his political opponent, Count of Warwick (later Duke of Northumberland), and was deposed in 1549 and imprisoned in the Tower of London, where he was executed in 1552. After that, the Gokoku-kyo (Minister of Gokoku) was not established until the Seito Rebellion. The Charter of Governance, established in 1653 as the first written constitution in the United Kingdom after the Puritan Revolution, established the position of the head of state, which had been absent since the execution of Charles I, as \"Lord Protector\", and on 16 December appointed Oliver Cromwell, commander of the New Model Army and independent politician, as the Lord of Protector for the rest of his life. The period in which the Gokoku-kyo ruled the United Kingdom was referred to as \"the Gokoku-kyo era\" or \"the Protectorate\". The title of provincial governor was defined by the Charter of Governance, but the three countries, England, Scotland, and Ireland, were shared with the Parliament, the legislature, and the legislature, and the consent of the State Council was required during the closure of the legislature. The State Council, however, was Cromwell's advisory body, with many provisions that weakened the legislature's powers, and in fact strengthened the powers of the Gokoku-kyo. The middle class was supported by the Gokoku-kyo (Minister of Gokoku), but other factions, such as the royal faction and the equality faction, were opposed to each other. On 3 September 1654, Cromwell opened the first legislature, but the legislature continued to criticize the legislature's legitimacy, disbanding on 22 January 1655 and establishing a military government in August 1655 with the Gokoku-kyo as its de facto dictator.",

Since the pandemic, information has been intricate in unprecedented situations, and issues such as racism and ideology conflicts have emerged around the world. In order to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, countries around the world imposed restrictions on entry into the country, but COVID-19, which has high occultities such as lack of conscious symptoms, has affected more than 180 countries and regions through waterfront countermeasures in each country, and a large-scale outbreak has occurred all over the world. This led to a series of lockdowns around the world, which hindered demand and supply chains, causing a social and economic impact known as the Corona Shock.

The time from infection to onset is usually 5 days, but depending on the person, there is a width from 2 to 14 days. Symptoms include fever, coughing, shortness of breath, abnormal taste or smell, cold, cold, headache, sore throat, and muscle. However, as it is said to be a \"simple virus\", it shows characteristics that make it difficult to grasp the infection of the host, and the virus is very prone to spread, and it is also prone to sudden death.

As the whole world was at risk of infectious diseases, it fell into situations that humans have not experienced in the past, such as global lockdowns, immigration restrictions, and postponement and reduction of international events. Anti-globalization and anti-democratic policies, such as lockdowns to converge the pandemic, greatly reduced freedom of action and significantly reduced economic activity.

The epidemic led to the onlineization of life, but food, tourism, leisure, entertainment, transportation, etc. were not available online, and many businesses were confirmed to be closed.

The thirteen constellation uses the thirteen constellation rather than the twelve constellations when a new constellation is moved on the ecliptic. The age difference is similar to that of the cyderial system, but since the actual size of the constellation is used in conjunction with the eclipse, the 13 signs are inequality in various sizes. This is an unprecedented thing in ancient times, and it is a new fortune telling that is the idea of modern people. Because the spring equinox was moved due to age difference (the flow of time), the constellation was moved to Juni-gu Shrine next to one of the constellations (e.g., Yagi-gu Shrine was moved from Mabuchi-gu Shrine to Takarabi-gu Shrine). If you look at the north top of the sky (the North Pole) and look at it clockwise based on the North Pole, the tenth order (the one named in ancient Chinese astronomy on the constellation) is lined from west to east (reverse clockwise). Due to the fact that the calendar year is not constant and does not coincide with the regression year and there is a time difference, the period varies from a few hours to a day depending on the year and time zone. For a time scale of more than 100 years, the table date is approximated by a large difference in the age difference in the tropical method. The exact period of each year can be known using a Western astrology astronomical calendar or computer software. The eclipse is 0-29\u00b0 if the unit below the degree is not used.

Twelve signs are collectively called Juni-gu Shrine or Yodo Juni-gu Shrine. It is also known as the zodiac sign. In addition, depending on the school of astrology, it is different where the 0\u00b0 of Hakusangu Shrine, which is the base point of the 12 signs, is determined, but it can be roughly divided into two types: a tropical system and a biological system. In Western astrology, the tropical method is the mainstream, and in Indian astrology, the psychedelic method is the mainstream. In Western astrology, there is a concept of \"house\" that divides the eclipse into 12 segments as well as the sign, but while the house deals with more specific matters, the sign takes care of the more basic character and nature. The sign is believed to have been set in the ancient Babylonian period. However, the order and the name are slightly different from the modern one. Those from Babylonia to the west were incorporated into the system of Greek mythology, which was transmitted to India from Greece to the aftermath of the B.C. There are similar signs in ancient China, but it is not certain whether they were created by propagation. Later, a sign was sent from India to China through Buddhist scriptures, and it was also introduced to Japan. The name of the shrine in kanji is thought to have been abbreviated to astrology, which was first translated from the West. It is different from the constellations and constellations established by astronomy, but is often mixed. It is very similar to the 12 chapters that were introduced to Japan from China, but the relationship with each other is not known in detail. The actual zodiac constellations are large and small, but the sign separates the zodiac constellations from the zodiac constellations and divides the zodiac constellations into 12 zodiac constellations. In the early days, the actual constellations and signs were roughly identical, but were deviated by age differences. It was the ancient Greek Hipparchus who discovered the age difference. Due to age differences, the vernal equinox is moving at a rate of 1\u00b0 to the constellation in 72 years, and its angle has reached more than 20\u00b0, which is close to one sign from the time of Hipparcos (accurate degrees are for each school that adopts a psycherial).",

In 1952, he was awarded the FWA Player of the Year Award. He continued to play in Ulbs until his retirement in August 1959, scoring 13 goals in 490 league games. He made his England debut against Belgium on 19 January 1946 (a 2-0 win for England). He competed in the 1950 FIFA World Cup in Brazil, the 1954 FIFA World Cup in Switzerland, and the 1958 FIFA World Cup in Sweden. He was also the captain of the team from 1948 onwards, playing 90 games. The number of caps was the fifth highest in English history (as of January 2011) and the highest number of caps in English history for more than 10 years until it was repainted by Bobby Moore. He was also the first player to play 100 games in England. In addition to Bobby Moore, he has the largest number of captains in history. After his retirement, he went on to become a leader, and in 1962 was appointed director of Arsenal FC. Although he finished seventh in the first season, his grades gradually declined, and after finishing 14th in the 1965\u201366 season, he was dismissed by Arsenal's board of directors in the summer of 1966.",

In addition, the development of Nitta was prosperous, and the construction of a waterway was carried out. Typical examples of this are Ogawae and Ayae. Ogawae was opened by the county magistrate Kanbei SAWAMURA Katsusada, and was located in 31 villages, 30 km from Ogawa to Shikura. Aiyae gained 23 villages from Aiya Village to Numanouchi Village. Yoshinao NAITO was the one who became the lord of the domain after Tadaoki retired. Since he had been devoted to waka (Japanese poetry) and haikai (Japanese poetry) since he was young, he handed over the domain government to his pageboy, Namenosuke MATSUGA. This later became the basis of the Koshoku uprising in the Ibaraki-Heishi Domain. After Yoshinao, his finances were oppressed by natural disasters and fushin until the generations of Yoshitaka, Yoshitane, and Masaki. Under such circumstances, a peasant uprising occurred in September 1738 (Genbun Hyakusho uprising). Because of this, there was a punitive meaning, and in 1747, the Naito clan was transferred to Hyuga no Nobeoka. Masatsune INOUE came after the Naito clan. He ruled the Ibaraki-Heishi Domain for only about 10 years from 1747 to 1758, and there are few historical materials. After the Inoue clan, Nobunari ANDO, the lord of the Mino-Kana Domain, entered the Imperial Palace. After entering the Imperial Palace, he established the domain school Sesei-do Hall on Hachiman-koji Street and educated the children of feudal retainers. He mainly studied Chinese classics and followed the swordsmanship. He mainly taught Shishogokyo (four books and five sutras), Japanese language, elementary school, tsukan (study), and calligraphy, and later he incorporated military law and Western studies. Two spring and fall exams rewarded the best performers. It was the highest school of the Ibaraki-Heishi Domain until it was abolished in 1871. Nobumasa ANDO, the fifth lord of the domain, was the most famous of the successive lords. After the Sakuradamongai Incident, Nobumasa led the shogunate government as roju (member of shogun's council of elders), but he lost his position in the Sakashitamongai Incident in 1862 and was forced to retire and his territory was reduced to 40,000 koku.",

The domain office was Iwaki-chihei-jo Castle. The Iwaki clan had been in control of the southern part of Hama-dori Street since the end of the Heian period, but it was confiscated by the western army in the Battle of Sekigahara. The Iwaki clan later moved to Kameda DEWA (present-day Yurihonjo City, Akita Prefecture) via the Shinano-Nakamura Domain (Kawanakajima Domain). The Ibaraki-Heishi Domain was governed by the Torii, Naito, Inoue, and Ando clans, but they were close associates of the Tokugawa Shogun family. The Ibaraki-Heishi Domain is also known as the territory of Nobumasa ANDO, a roju (member of shogun's council of elders) who promoted the union of public and military forces at the end of the Edo period. Tadamasa TORII was the one who ruled the southern part of Hamadori after the Iwaki clan left. When Tadamasa entered Iinodaira, he changed the character 'iwa' of Iwaki to 'Ibarakidaira' and changed the name of the city to 'Ibarakidaira,' and was given 100,000 koku of four counties in the southeastern part of Mutsu Province. Tadamasa changed the character 'iwa' to avoid the character '\u5ca9\u57ce' because the Iwaki clan opposed the Tokugawa clan in Sekigahara. The Iwaki clan's castle was Odate-jo Castle (Iino Hei-jo Castle), but the castle was newly built on the east side of the castle, and the castle town was reorganized accordingly. The town of Kashiwaya, which was located near today's Hachiman-koji Street, was moved to the residence of the vassals, and many temples and shrines were moved to the high ground, where the castle was built. When constructing Ibaraki Heijo-jo Castle, there is a story about Tango as a pillar for the purpose of quenching water, and it still remains under the name of 'Tango-zawa.' The Torii clan was transferred to Yamagata, Dewa Province in 1622. After the Torii clan was transferred to Yamagata, the lord of the domain who entered Ibaraki-daira was Masanaga NAITO of Sakkan KAMISO. He was given 20,000 koku (crop yields) by his legitimate son Tadanaga (Tadaoki) and 10,000 koku (crop yields) by Oshige HIJIKATA, a court lady of Masanaga, and 70,000 koku (crop yields) by the Ibaraki-Heishi Domain. Tadaoki NAITO was the successor to Masanaga's death. The following year, he carried out a total land survey in his territory for about ten years, which resulted in an increase in income of 20,000 koku.",

Whaling was prosperous in this area, and it became the base of the domain's finances. However, immediately after the establishment of the territory of Totomi, fishermen in Arikawa Village, Fukue Province (present-day Shinjogoto-cho, Minamimatsuura County) and Uome Village, Totomi Province (Shinjogoto-cho) had a fisheries right problem that led to bloodshed. Due to the mediation of the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), the enrollment system was established in 1689, and the problem was resolved. After that, the domain's finances were enriched by the profit of whaling. In the latter half of the Edo period, the finances of the domain, which had been enriched by whaling, were also put to a standstill due to repeated famines. For this reason, in order to grasp and secure the working population of the sixth lord of the domain, Moriakira started a thorough personal understanding policy called 'reintroduction of personnel' in 1721, and detailed the number, age, and status of family members with the family head, origin, and status of the family members. In 1761, Morimichi, the seventh lord of the domain, started the biggest misconduct in the history of domain administration called 'Sannen hokosei.' This was similar to the slavery system in which a daughter other than the eldest daughter of the people of the domain was given to a samurai family in Fukue without paying for three years when she reached the age of 16. After three years of dedication, he returned to the village and married, but when he divorced, he was again dedicated to three years. There was a loophole that if five koku of rice or 300 monme of silver were given to the domain, it would be exempted, but it was not the amount that could be exempted if it was not a very wealthy territory, but most of the people were consecrated. This system continued until the end of the Edo period, along with the 'reintroduction of people.' In 1849, Morikan GOSHIMA, the lord of the Totomi Domain, received permission from the bakufu to build the castle, and Morinari GOSHIMA, the tenth lord of the domain, started construction. In 1863, Ishida-jo Castle was completed as the newest castle in Japan by Morinori, the 11th lord of the Goto Domain. In 1871, it became Fukue Prefecture due to Haihan-chiken (abolition of feudal domains and establishment of prefectures). It was later incorporated into Nagasaki Prefecture.

From the establishment of the domain to the return of the family register, the Goto family, a gaiyo daimyo, served as the lord of the domain. The kokudaka yielded more than 15,000 koku (for a time, the territory of Totomi was divided into 3,000 koku and became more than 12,000 koku), and the domain office was Ishida-jo Castle (originally Egawa-jo Castle, present-day Goto City, Nagasaki Prefecture) and was the lord daimyo (feudal lord). In 1187, TAIRA no Iemori (the second son of TAIRA no Tadamori and younger paternal half-brother of TAIRA no Kiyomori) landed on Ukushima Island and took the name of Uku. In 1351, Ukukaku moved from Uku to Gijuku, Fukue Island, and in 1587, Sumiharu UKU changed his family name to Goto. The establishment of the domain started in 1603 at the beginning of the Edo period when Genga GOSHIMA (a heir of Jungen GOSHIMA), the first lord of the domain, was granted a shuinjo, which allowed Ieyasu TOKUGAWA to hold more than 15,000 koku of territory. Moritoshi, the second lord of the domain, took over his position as an adopted son of Genga in 1612. In 1619, Shusui OHAMA, who was an adopted son of Genga's biological son, Kakuemon GOSHIMA, appealed directly to the bakufu to claim his successor's rights and to lose Moritoshi's government. However, the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) recognized Moritoshi's legitimacy and refused to sue Shusui. Moritoshi executed Shusui and his group. It is the so-called 'Ohama Shusui Incident.' Taking advantage of this incident, he started to strengthen the control of the lord of the domain and established the foundation of the domain government. He enforced thorough separation of soldiers and farmers and forced his vassals, who lived in each chigyo-chi, to move to Fukue-jo Castle, which was called 'Fukue-naori.' Fukue Repair was completed in 1634. In 1635, the land survey in the territory was carried out, and the chigyo-daka and the rank of the vassals who were vague were determined. In addition, instead of Egawa-jo Castle, which was burnt down in 1614, he built Ishida Jinya in 1637 and established a domain office. In 1652, 'Onnajima-bugyo' (magistrate of Onnajima Island) was newly established on a group of men's and women's islands where the number of residents was increasing at the height of its peak as a fishing ground.",

Mereagros was first mentioned in the Battle of the Getais (335 BC) in Alexander's Tracia Expedition. During the eastern expedition of Alexandrus, which began the following year, Mereagros commanded a party of Faranks, who fought in the main battles such as the Battle of the Granikos River, the Battle of Issus, and the Battle of Gaugamera. In the summer of 333 BC, together with Koinos and Ptolemy (son of Seleucus), he was allowed to return to his home country for his new marriage, and was ordered to command a soldier sent from Cadia to Macedonia. During Alexander's invasion of Sogdiana, along with Koinos, and during the invasion of Massagethai, along with Polupercon, Attalos, and Gorgias, Mereagros remained in Baktra in preparation for Spitamenes, who had continued to resist the Macedonian army. In India, he was sent with Gorgias and Claytus to the region of Peukelaotis (now Chalsada) under Perdiccas. Mereagros often fought as a detachment under Clateros in other operations in India, including the Battle of the Persian Gate and the Battle of the River Hydaspes. However, despite this work, Alexander has no sign of promoting him to a higher or more reliable position, and it cannot be seen that he will fight with important independent command. Mereagros tried to hold power at a meeting held after Alexander's death in 323 BC, and confronted Perdiccus. According to Justin, Mereagros was the first person to propose to generals to discuss whether to choose between Aridius or Hercules, the son of Balsine, as king or instead wait for Roxane's son. Kurtius at the same time described Mereagros as a person who opposed Perdiccus, who insisted that Roxane's unborn son (later Alexander IV) should be a king, and slandered against Perdicus' ambition to take power as a regent. At that time, the meeting was canceled due to the turmoil of infantry pushing Aridius. Mereagros was sent to the infantry's forgiveness to quell the soldier's fuss and dissatisfaction, but turned to the mob's side and declared support for the infantry's claims.",

The currency economy did not permeate to the general public, and, on the contrary, as with other German colonies, little infrastructure was developed, such as roads and water, or even elementary education for locals. In fact, there are many remains and remains of the Spanish and Japanese periods, but there are few remains and remains of the German period. When the First World War began in 1914, the Japanese-British Alliance, which had been concluded at the time, sent a naval force that declared war on Germany as one of the same allies as Britain and France, surrendering and occupying the few German garrison in a blink of an eye. In 1919, during the post-war peace conference in Paris, Palau became a Japanese mandate. The South Sea Agency and the South Sea Agency's western branch office (the Palau branch office) were located in Color, and Palau became the core island of the surrounding islands, and many Japanese emigrated.

Since the beginning of Japanese rule, the development of social infrastructures such as electricity and water, schools and hospitals, roads and public facilities, and the transition to the monetary economy, which had little progress under German rule, were emphasized. By the 1920s, Coroll was transformed into a modern townscape. Many Japanese settled, and they tried to treat the Palau people with no discrimination as much as possible.

Since 2/3 of Japan was affected by the disaster at the end of the early-modern times when the literacy culture was highly developed, the old record about this earthquake is very much left as a historical earthquake. During the Ansei period, descriptions of earthquakes appeared in letters and other documents in addition to diaries, and even detailed records of people's actions during the disaster were recorded. In particular, the records of temples are used to study seismicity distribution as homogeneous and reliable data. On December 23, 1854, at 9:30 p.m. in Kumano-toge Pass and Enshu-toge Pass, there was a huge earthquake that caused a tremor in Suruga Bay (34.00 degrees north latitude, 137 degrees 48 minutes north latitude, 137.0 degrees north latitude, 137.8 degrees east longitude, 34.0 degrees east longitude, 137.8 degrees ; 137.8 notes 1).

Seismic damage along the shore of Suruga Bay was particularly significant, and since it is estimated that the seismic intensity was 7 in the western part of Suruga Bay and the Kofu Basin, it is estimated that the source of the earthquake was further into the back of Suruga Bay or inland than the Hoei Earthquake. From the southern part of the Tohoku region to China and Shikoku, the seismic intensity is 4 or more, and the length of the earthquake source area is estimated to be about 300 km.

It is estimated that the Philippine Sea Plate was a huge earthquake with a plate boundary type associated with the sinking of the Philippine Sea Plate. At that time, it was also called Tora no taka. It is also considered to be one of the major Nankai Trough earthquakes, and is collectively referred to as the Ansei Earthquake or the Ansei Great Earthquake along with the Ansei Nankai Earthquake (M8.4), which occurred about 32 hours later. This earthquake occurred in the Kaei era, but this natural disaster and the arrival of the Black Ship in the previous year were changed to Ansei, and it is called Ansei because it is the year of Ansei on the historical timeline. The earthquake source area of the Ansei-Tokai Earthquake was estimated to have reached the land area from the back of Suruga Bay, and a significant earthquake area and a fault called an earthquake mountain appeared near the mouth of the Fuji-gawa River. Fault models are also assumed in Suruga Bay because of the tectonic changes around Suruga Bay and the occurrence of tsunamis on the surface of the sea in Suruga Bay. Since it has already been more than 100 years since the Ansei-Tokai Earthquake occurred, there is concern about the occurrence of the next Tokai earthquake (# refer to the warning against the next Tokai earthquake). In the Edo period, there was a record of the Hoei Earthquake in 1707 as a huge earthquake caused by the Nankai Trough. In addition, it is considered that the Ansei Earthquake may have been 'the first and last earthquake after the Hoei Earthquake,' and there is a view that the time interval for coming again after the Hoei Earthquake 147 is rather short as a huge earthquake along the Nankai Trough. The Keicho Earthquake, which occurred in 1605, was once thought to be an earthquake along the Nankai Trough because the source area of the earthquake was located on the Tokaido and Nankai Roads. There are various theories about the source area of the Keicho earthquake, and many questions remain about the large earthquake along the Nankai Trough, and there is a view that it may be not an earthquake along the Nankai Trough, for example, along the Izu and Ogasawara Trench, or a remote tsunami.",

He was born in Madrid, Spain. Since his father, Pedro, was an engineer and his workplace was near the home of Atretico Madrid, Raoul said he had been playing soccer since he was a child. He joined the club team at the age of 10. It is said that the sense of goal was noticeable from that time on. Francisco de Paula, who commanded the youth of Atretico at the time, visited the group on offer. Because his father Pedro was a fan of Atretico, he immediately agreed and became a member of the Atretico Subcommittee, which was released at the end of the club's youth management. He moved to Real Madrid in 1992. Two years later, he was promoted to the top team by Baldano, who was the director at the time, and made his top team debut at the age of 17 and 4 at the club's youngest record against Zaragoza in October 1994.

As a result, the daughters were able to have a formal marriage. The father was very pleased and watched to find out who threw the money. Then he found Nicholas, who had thrown in the money for the third time, and his father, trembling down, shed tears and thanked him. When he went to Jerusalem to pilgrimage to the tomb of his lord, he quelled the storm and deceived the dead sailor by falling off the ship. Nicholas became a monk after the pilgrimage, but by that time, the Archbishop Johannes had died in Mira, Lycia, and the people who were looking for his successor had been told by angels to make Nicholas their successor, and those who were pleased asked Nicholas to assume the title of Archbishop. Nicholas, who had declined, was unable to oppose the Lord, and Nicholas became Archbishop. Diligent Nicholas worked more and more for the people after becoming Archbishop. He chose two great priests to work with, praying for happiness for people, loving people like his father, listening to people's petitions and appeals, and defending them for those who were insulted or insulted. Nicholas, who had been pastoral in this way, suddenly suffered a major persecution for the church that maintained peace. It was a persecution by Diocletian and Galerius. Nicholas was captured and imprisoned because he did not fear the persecution and still tried to evangelize. In prison, Nicholas encouraged the prisoners who were captured together. With the enthronement of Emperor Constantine, the persecution stopped, and Nicholas returned to his position as Archbishop. At the first Congress of the Dukes of Nicaea, he was excommunicated because he hit Alius violently, but the excommunication was lifted due to the phantom appearance of Christ and the mother of God, Mary, and evidence of the innocence of Nicholas.

He was born in Patara, the Roman province of Lycia in Asia Minor, and became Archbishop of Lycia. It is also called Nicholas of Bari because of the transfer of relics to Bari, Italy in 1087. All sects with the concept of saints are worshipped as saints. The official title of the Orthodox Church is 'Saint Nicholas of the Archbishop of Mira Likia' (according to the Orthodox calendar issued by the Orthodox Church of Japan) and is venerated and respected. He was a different person from Nikolai Kasatkin, who taught the Orthodox Church in Japan (although he used the name of the saint as a guardian saint). His life has been legendised from early on, and Nicholas is preferred to be written on Icon. It was emphasized in the Eastern Church and in southern Italy, but its reverence later spread throughout the Western Church. Although Nicholas does not have most theological works, he is revered in the Orthodox Church for embodying Christian life. The day of memory is twice a year (December 6/19, which is the original day of memory, and the day of immortal migration from Mira to Bali), and in prayers (e.g., evening and early) held every Thursday to remember the saints, it is always mentioned in particular importance among many saints. He is also a patron saint of 'a man who suffers from innocence' in the Western Church. In the biography of St. Nicholas, there are many stories of helping the weak, and stories of teaching the weak to protect the truth. Especially when helping the weak, it was common to try not to be known to others. In addition, there is a title as a quirky person because he made many quirks. It should be noted that the following descriptions and texts are not historical facts, but merely outlines of the biography handed down by the Orthodox Church. Nicholas was born in Patara, the Roman province of Lycia, in Asia Minor. Nicholas, the bishop of his uncle Patal (who was the same name as his nephew), found the basis of virtue in his nephew and preached Nicholas' father and mother to engage in the church from an early age.",

The domain office was located in Muramatsu-jo Castle (present-day Gosen City, Niigata Prefecture). The Muramatsu Domain started in 1639 when Naotoki HORI, the second son of Naoyori HORI, was given 30,000 koku of Yasuda. In May 1644, when Naotoki's son Naoyoshi HORI's territory was changed and the jinya was moved from Yasuda to Muramatsu, the official Muramatsu Domain started. Since the Muramatsu Domain was a mountainous area for most of its territory, it is said that the amount of kokudaka was small even when Nitta was developed, and the actual kokudaka was 40,000 koku in 1687. Naoyoshi, the second lord of the domain, carried out kenchi (land survey) in his territory and established control over the domain. However, since financial deterioration appeared after Naoyoshi's death, the domain government was often reformed, but it was not effective. In addition, during the time of Naosuke HORI, the eighth lord of the domain, the seizure of peasants in the name of financial reform centered on Gengo HORI, the chief retainer of the family, led to the outbreak of peasant uprisings throughout the Muramatsu Domain in 1814. In February 1850, during the time of Naohisa HORI, the ninth lord of the domain, he was given the title of the lord of the castle, and Muramatsu Jinya was converted into a castle. In 1853, Naonaka took control of the leadership of the domain administration and promoted the production of textiles, paper, brushes, tea, and muramatsuyaki, such as MURAMATSU SEN, and tried to promote the industry, but in 1860, Naohisa HORI, who succeeded Naonaka's position and became the lord of the domain, died on July 12, and Naonaka also died on September 6, so the reform failed. At the end of the Edo period, the Sonno theory emerged within the Muramatsu Domain, conflicting between Sonno Joi and a group insisting on reforming the military system, and the Muramatsu Shichishi Incident (the incident in which seven Sonno Joi faction were executed by the Conservatives) occurred in November 1866, which caused great confusion in the domain. Therefore, during the Boshin War, the opinion of the domain split between the faction centered on Yasugoro KONDO of the Justice Party, who insisted that it should be supported by the new government, and the conservative suburban faction centered on Naoga HORI, the 11th lord of the domain.",

A parade of Romanian troops will be held in Bucharest and Alba Julia, showing the vehicles of the Army Air Force and playing the Romanian national anthem \"Awaken, Romanian!\". Free concerts and street festivals are held annually in each Romanian city. On TV, a number of special programs are broadcast, especially those that spotlight Romanian celebrities and key figures on Pro TV. This day is usually finished with fireworks. At the beginning of December, Christmas lights are lit on the streets. This evening, Mo Nicolae (St. Nicholas) arrives to deliver presents to children. Children receive presents from midnight on December 5 to the morning of the next 6 days. Traditionally, presents are placed in knitted boots. Gifts are generally sweets or books, but bad children receive wooden sticks. December 20 is St. Ignati's Day. From this day on, Romanians begin preparing for the last Christmas, such as cutting pigs for Christmas Eve dinner. Christmas trees are usually purchased in public markets and supermarkets these days. On December 24, the Christmas Eve (Noaptea de anjun) is attended by children from the neighboring neighborhood. On this day, a cookie of Carol's buckwheat is baked for the children by a woman. Usually by this time the decoration of the Christmas tree will be finished. From Christmas to New Year, it is customary to sing a traditional Christmas carol called Colind, where children gather and travel from home to home, and receive presents such as sweets. Corinda is a kind of Christmas carol that celebrates the birthday of Christ and is held throughout Romania. Corinda, which has been handed down since ancient times, is characterized by different regions, including parts of the lyrics and the timing of the melody. It is probably rooted in the Saturnarian Festival, a winter solstice festival that predates Christianity. At Christmas Supper, pork dishes such as the traditional Salmale (roll cabbage) and Cozonac (a kind of traditional cake) are served as Christmas cakes. In Romanian Christmas, pork was valued, and in the past, each family (especially rural ones) had dismantled pigs and prepared for supper before Christmas, but as of 2017, fewer families have dismantled themselves.",

Although Christmas celebrations were introduced after Romanian Christianity, the concept of religion, Jesus Christ, and church was banned during the socialist era (1948\u20131989). Both democratization and Romanian Christmas reopened and became more festive. The Christmas festive season begins on the day of the Apostle Andrei on November 30 and ends on the day of John's Day on January 7. The main festivities celebrated during this period include the Unification Day of December 1, St. Nicholas Day, St. Ignati Day, Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, St. Stephen's Day, New Year's Eve, and Shingen Festival. All Romanian Orthodox believers should defend the Seven Weeks of the Advent period (Sai) when Christ is on his way to the New Year's Eve. This will begin on November 14, and will continue until Christmas Day. This November 14 is traditionally referred to as \"Lsata secului\". During this period, all products using animals are prohibited. It is also said that on Wednesdays and Fridays, all oils and fats, including other types, will not be eaten. However, fish and dairy products are eaten on special days such as St. Ignati's Day and Unification Day. Christmas Eve is also a full greedy day to thank God for sending the Savior.

In addition, in the Emishi area, which was the production area of Emishi and Emishi, the eastern Emishi area (the Pacific coast of Hokkaido and the northern territories and the area of Tokuso County) became the tenryo (territory) of Wajinchi and the western Emishi region (the coasts of Hokkaido, Sakhalin and Okhotsk coasts) in 1807, and the magistrate's office was located in Usugishikan and the Ou clans guarded it. In 1809, Sakhalin was divided from the West Emishi as the North Emishi.

His nickname is \"Enken\". The main instruments are acoustic guitar, electric guitar and blues harp. He also plays ukulele, piano, and drums. He also wrote and wrote almost all of his own songs. Active with \"pure music\" as the keyword. His representative songs include \"A blues of a night train,\" \"I wonder if I can be satisfied,\" \"Curry Rice,\" \"Tokyo Watshoi,\" \"A man of immortality,\" and \"A cry of dreams.\" His favorite food is curry rice. I love cats, and there are many songs in the lyrics where cats appear. He was born in Katsuta City, Ibaraki Prefecture (present-day Hidatsunaka City) and grew up in various places in the prefecture. After graduating from Ibaraki Prefectural Ota Daiichi High School, he went to Tokyo. Inspired by Bob Dylan's \"Like a Rolling Stone\" which comes from the FEN I heard while living a ronin life in Tokyo, he started singing and guitar himself after he entered Meiji Gakuin University, and became a figure in the fork scene of the late 1960s. He interacted with Watari Takada and Masato Minami as an amateur singer in Tokyo. In August 1968, he participated in the \"Third Fork Camp\" held at Takara-dera Temple in Yamazaki, Kyoto for the first time, and met people of Takaishi and five red balloons, Ryo Kagawa, The Fork Crucedas, and Kansai Fork. She sings, \"I want you,\" \"It's true,\" and \"It's raining outside.\" In the same year, he joined the Takaishi Music Office in Tokyo. In 1969, 1970, and 1971, he appeared in the Nakatsugawa Fork Jamboree. The live recordings of this period are included on the live compilation album \"Minmei Era Live\" (published in 1989). In addition, exchanges with artists who have left a name in the history of rock/fork in Japan, such as guest appearances at concerts by Jacks and Nobuyasu Okabayashi, have already begun since this time. In particular, Happyado has been the back of Endo since his predecessor, Valentine Blue. In the 1970s, there were many recordings of the concert, including the first concert in spring and the Hobo's concert. He has also participated in recordings of other musicians, and can also listen to his performances and songs in the resting countries, such as Takada Watari, Agata Mori Fish, and Kamatsuki Hiroshi. In 1974, he opened a curry shop \"Wartz\" in Dogenzaka, Shibuya.",

        "paragraph": "However, this position in the center is under very intense pressure, and the defending of the opponent's defensive midfielder to the player is also required, so physical strength and momentum are required at the same time. Among the players who do little hard work such as defense, it is regarded as \"classical\" and \"classical\" because there are many such players in the past. The world-famous top players often combine techniques and power. A central midfielder is a position placed in the middle of a line, such as 4-4-2 or 3-4-3. There is no position such as a diamond type or a box type which separates the front and rear from the defensive, and when it is placed sideways, it is a position similar to the defensive MF, but it is a position that is responsible for a wide range of positions to the offensive position in the case of an attack. In Japan, the term 'Center Half' is often referred to as this position. It is particularly common in Italy in the early 1990s and in England, where 4-4-2 is common. In a position that doubles as an offensive MF and a defensive MF, a comprehensive ability over both sides of the offensive and a large amount of exercise covering the entire middle board is required. It is considered to be a defensive midfielder in Italy and Spain. Also, depending on the formation, it is rarely called the 2.5th row because it is between the offensive MF (second row) and the defensive MF (third row). In England, the term \"midfielder\" is sometimes used to refer to the position. Centre half was an old name that began with the two-back system in the late 19th century, indicating a central halfback when MF was called halfback. The two-back system played a major role in attacking five FW balls and defending them by marking the inner forward from both sides of the enemy's center forward to the front. Since it is not a central position but a central position, such as an anchor, it may be a complete defensive position at the end of the middle row, or it may refer to the position of attacking and participating in the front line, in the same sense as the central midfielder.",

On the other hand, the allied forces of Takakuni and Ouchi were dispatched from 20,000 to 30,000 soldiers to capture Nyoiga-toge Pass. After that, he entered into battle, but Sumimoto and Yukinaga fled to Awa. The recapture of Kyoto by Sumimoto and Yukinaga ended in failure, but there was still a threat. Yoshizumi ASHIKAGA, who was deprived of the Shogunate position by Yoshitane, escaped from Kyoto to replace Takakuni's entry into Kyoto and entered Omiokayama-jo Castle relying on the Kuri clan, but Takakuni and Yoshioki followed the Battle of Okayama-jo Castle on October 2. There is a theory that there was no major battle in this battle. Sumimoto and Yukinaga's army had only 3,000 soldiers, and it is difficult to think that Yukinaga, who was a good warlord, planned to recapture Kyoto with this force, and it is thought that the purpose was to open up the war and run back to Awa. In addition, there is a theory that the two camps faced each other because they could find a description that 'they used the heavy rain at night to run' (\"Sanetaka Koki\" (a diary of Sanetaka)), but they escaped due to the heavy rain in the night. However, according to Kuge Nikki (a diary of court nobles), there was a small battle because it was hunted down and killed by displaced warriors around Kyoto, and 60 people were captured and executed. According to Takahiro MABE, although he initially intended to intervene with his grandfather, Nariyuki HOSOKAWA of Awa Province, he pointed out that the Kagawa clan, the Kasai clan and the Atomi clan of Sanuki Province, who had originally been on the side of Sumiyuki HOSOKAWA, had invaded the Kagawa clan and the Awa clan on the Sumimoto side in response to Takakuni's request, and therefore, he was forced to retreat to Awa Province because Nariyuki, who was wary of the invasion of Sanuki forces, was on the way. He also pointed out that this caused Nariyuki and Yukito (Nariyuki's grandson and Sumimoto's real brother) to be reluctant to fight against Takakuni, prioritizing the retention of their territory, Awa, and was one of the causes of the subsequent slump in the Battle of Sumimoto.",

It is unknown whether the size of the battle, whether he tried to invade Kyoto again, or whether he tried to break through his return to Awa Province. According to the map, it is sometimes described as Nyoigatani. In the Eisho Disturbance in 1507, Masamoto HOSOKAWA was assassinated by his adopted son Sumiyuki HOSOKAWA, and the other adopted sons Sumimoto HOSOKAWA and Yukinaga MIYOSHI escaped to Koga, Omi Province, but soon invaded Kyoto and defeated the Sumiyuki faction. Sumimoto took the position of the head of the Hosokawa clan, and Yukinaga achieved his prominence as a close adviser to Sumimoto. Taking advantage of such confusion, the former shogun Yoshitane ASHIKAGA, who was chased by Masamoto in the Meio Coup, tried to go to Kyoto relying on Yoshioki OUCHI. Sumimoto, who was aware of this movement, asked his grandfather, Nariyuki HOSOKAWA, and Takakuni HOSOKAWA, the third adopted son of Masamoto, to reconcile with Yoshioki OUCHI and others. However, there was an incident in which Takakuni planned to take over the family estate and communicated with Yoshioki and others, and on March 17, 1508, he called himself Ise-sangu Shrine, escaped from Kyoto, and stayed with Takanaga NIKI, a Shugo (military governor) of Iga Province. On April 9, the lords of Settsu and Tanba Provinces, which were the territory of Sumimoto, were dissatisfied with the Takakuni side, and Sumimoto and Yukinaga, who judged the situation that the Ouchi army was approaching, set fire to their residences and evacuated to Omi again. On the next day, Takakuni entered Kyoto, and on June 9, Yoshitane ASHIKAGA entered Kyoto from Saga, and on July 1, he was appointed again as shogun, and Takakuni was appointed to kanrei (shogunal deputy) and Yoshioki was appointed to kanreidai (shogunal deputy). Thus Takakuni, who expelled Sumimoto, became the head of the Hosokawa clan. After that, Sadamasa IKEDA, a kokujin (local governor) of Settsu Province and a member of the Sumimoto group, was killed in the battle, and Bungo no kami (Governor of Akutagawa Province) of Akutagawa Province, who tried to escape to Awa Province, was also hit by a typhoon, and Nobukata AKUTAGAWA, who was an adopted son of Buzen no kami (Governor of Buzen Province), was told that he was allowed to surrender from Takakuni, and he was attacked by a coffin and killed, and conscripting troops from Omi Province was also difficult, and Sumimoto was unable to find an active road.",

He died at the age of 24. According to \"Nihonshoki\" (Chronicles of Japan), his wife, Princess Yamanobe, died of starvation. According to the title of \"Manyoshu\" (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves), she went to Ise-jingu Shrine where her older sister, Orai no Himemiko, served as Saio. Among the contents related to Prince Otsu's rebellion, some people argue that Prince Kawashima's confession was a fiction by Yoshitaka TSUKURA and others. In addition, there is a view that, like Kaoru WADA, he might have said that he should have scolded the Crown Prince at the Imperial Palace, and there is an understanding that, like Seiji OKADA, his visit to the Ise-jingu Shrine was contraindicated. However, there is no historical material other than \"Manyoshu\" (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves) regarding this trip to Ise, and there is a theory that it may be a fiction in the first place. There is no reliable historical material that tells the truth of the rebellion. Although he left his life in \"Manyoshu\" (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves) and \"Kaifuso\" (The Poetry of Kaifus), his poems in \"Kaifuso\" (The Poetry of Kaifus) have a similar expression to that in the poems of the posthumous lord of Chen, so it is understood by Noriyuki KOJIMA and Shin NAKANISHI that he was not a prince's work but a temporary work of a person after sympathy for him, and this theory is often supported at the academic conference level. There is a strong view that the background of the incident was Empress Sagano's intention (Kojiro NAOKI). Prince Otsu's tomb is governed by the Imperial Household Agency at the top of Mt. Odake, Mt. Futakami in Kazuki City, Nara Prefecture, at 135 degrees, 31 minutes, 32.35 seconds, 145 degrees, 40 minutes, 44.40 seconds, 34.5,25,6528 degrees, 135.679 degrees, 34.5,25,6528 degrees, and 135.67,790 times (the Tomb of Mt.

His wife was Yamanobe no Himemiko, the princess of Emperor Tenchi. He was born in 663 in Naotsu, Kyushu. According to \"Nihonshoki\" (Chronicles of Japan), he was the third prince of Emperor Tenmu (according to \"Kaifuso,\" he was the eldest son). According to \"Kaifuso\" (The Tale of Poetry), he said, 'I liked learning as a child, and liked to have a lot of literature as an exposition. I love martial arts and shot swords with a great deal of power. I'm terribly arrogant, and regardless of the way of life, I put down verses and thank my warriors. As a result, many people are entrusted.' (Since I was young, I liked learning, read books well, and wrote excellent sentences. Since I was an adult, I liked martial arts and treated swords skillfully. The character was free, unregulated, and I took a humble attitude as a prince, and I was treated as a prince, and I had a great desire to receive a large number of warriors.' \"Nihonshoki\" (Chronicles of Japan) also described the compliment of the purpose, and it seems that he was regarded as an outstanding person. His mother, Ota no Himemiko, was the princess of Emperor Tenchi and the older sister of Empress Sagano (later Empress Jito) and was able to be the empress, but Otsu passed away around the age of four, and her older sister Orai no Himemiko was also considered Saijo, so Otsu had little backing. Therefore, Prince Kusakabe, his older paternal half-brother, became the Crown Prince in 681. In February 683, he participated in the politics of the Imperial Court. Although there are various ways of thinking about Otsu's complaints about his participation in politics, such as 'Hajimechosei,' it seems reasonable to understand that he was in a position comparable to Kusakabe because he used the term \"Shoku Nihongi\" (Chronicles of Japan Continued) to refer to the political participation of the Crown Prince (Emperor Shomu) in \"Shoku Nihongi\" (Chronicle of Japan Continued). However, the political participation of Otsu, who was pedigreely compatible with Kusakabe, meant that the succession of the Imperial Throne to Kusakabe, which had been clarified in the first place, was half blank except for Prince Nagako and Imperial Prince Tatehito, who were still young at that time.",

Many traditional encyclopedias, such as \"Britannica Encyclopedia\" which was originally a paper medium, are now available on the web. Wikipedia, the open-source content written by the general public itself, is famous as a service that was originally deployed exclusively for the web. An encyclopedia is basically a collection of knowledge in a variety of fields or all kinds of fields, as described in explanations such as Kojiki and Daijisen. The Encyclopedia of the Encyclopedia and the Encyclopedia of Britannica also deal with such a range of knowledge. (This is common, but it is sometimes called 'goto hyakka' when it is intentionally distinguished from the following.) However, there are encyclopedias that collect a wide variety of knowledge in the area after being narrowed down to a specific area of expertise in advance. For example, \"Pharmacological Encyclopedia\" and \"Philosophical Encyclopedia\" are sometimes called 'Professional Encyclopedia.' As for the construction and arrangement method of encyclopedias, there is a method for classifying and organizing each item by field, and a method for arraying each item by the name of each item (in Western Europe, alphabetical order, in the case of encyclopedias in Japanese, 50 tone order, etc.) In many cases, each item is marked with a word with an article in the article, and it is possible to mutually refer to each other. It remains the same in online encyclopedias, such as Wikipedia, where words with articles in them are hyperlinked to make cross-reference easier. Since there is no mechanical arrangement in Chinese, most dictionaries and encyclopedias are classified. In the form of encyclopedias, there are two types of encyclopedias: O-itemism and O-itemism. In Japanese literature, for example, Ogotoism is a collection of items with a large theme, such as 'modern literature,' so that people can overview the trends of literature and famous writers and works in one item.",

The encyclopedia, derived from the Greek Koine \"\u03b3\u03bb\u03c0\u03b1\u03b4\u03b5\u03b1\", was a combination of the word enkyklios (enkyklios:en +kyklios, \"in circle\" in English) and \u03c0\u03b1\u03b4\u03b5\u03b1 (paideia), meaning \"education\" or \"children's upbringing\"), which was used by Greeks as a general knowledge of gathering, gathering, and listening to speakers around the city.

He was the lord of Kashiwazaki-jo Castle and Saruge-jo Castle. He was one of the Shichijugumi no daisho (Major Captain of the Seven Hands). It is said that he was born in 1513 as a son of Toshiie SHIBAZAKI, a kokujin (local governor) of Echigo Province (there is another theory that he was born in 1513). At first, he served Tamekage NAGAO, and after Tamekage's death, he served his son Harukage. When Harukage and Kagetora NAGAO (kenshin UESUGI) fought over the family estate, they supported Kagetora. Under Kenshin, he was appointed as the commander of the Sentegumi 300 horsemen, and in 1558, he served as a rusuiyaku (retainer) of Kasugayama-jo Castle. He also participated in the attack on the Hojo clan in Odawara in 1561, and immediately after that, he served as a spearhead in the Battle of Kawanakajima, the fourth battle against the Kai-Takeda clan, attacking the headquarters of Shingen TAKEDA in Hachimanbara, and drove the headquarters of the Takeda army to the near end. He was appointed as a bugyo (magistrate) together with Tomonobu SAITO and engaged in important measures such as exemption from various duties in the territory of Uesugi, and in 1570, he made an effort to conclude an alliance with Ujiyasu HOJO, and sent his son Haruie as a hostage to Odawara-jo Castle. Kenshin's trust was enormous, and when Kenshin's inauguration ceremony of Kanto Kanreishiki (shogunal deputy of the Kanto region) was held, he served as tachimochi with Tomonobu SAITO. On November 22, 1574, he died of illness. His second son, Haruie, succeeded to the post because his eldest son, Atsuie, was deeply involved in the attack on Ecchu the previous year (it is unknown whether he was alive or not).

However, Haruie's son, Haruie, was not involved in the crime of rebellion, and in the list of vassals of the Uesugi family in February 1577, he had the name of Haruie as the head of the Kashiwazaki family; in 1577, the Uesugi and Oda families were not in a state of war; and in addition, there were many doubts about whether Kenshin would be executed for certain reasons (see person and anecdote).",

The position is defender (left sideback) and midfielder (left wingback). He is one of the best left-sideback players in the world, as well as one of the world's best left-sideback players. From 1996 to 2007, he was in Real Madrid, Spain, and supported the Golden Age as a member of the Star Player Corps, known as the Galactic Corps. The powerful kick is called the devil's left foot. It is known in Japan as Lobecal's nickname. He was born as the youngest child to have three sisters, and worked with his father from an early age to support a poor family. I was always running because I couldn't pay for the bus to go to the textile factory 20 km from my home. In addition, it seems that when he was a boy, the distance from home to school was several hundred kilometers, but he ran every day and went to school. Because of this, he never kicked a soccer ball until he was 13 years old. He started his career at the local club Union San Joan and moved to Palmeras in 1993. Immediately afterward, he contributed to the 1993 and 1994 Brazilian national championships with Geno and Ebail. He moved to Intel, Italy, in 1995. Although he suddenly hit the FK in the opening game and scored in the second game as well, manager Roy Hodgson wanted to use him in the left wing position, making it a disappointing season for Roberto Carlos, who wanted to play on the left sideback. Fabio Capello of Real Madrid tried to convince Roberto Carlos, who was unable to adapt to Italian football. In 1996, he moved to Real Madrid, Spain. The transfer was only \u20ac3.6 million.

Due to the western and eastern borders of the region, the political convictions of the European princes also affected the missionary activities themselves, and the missionary activities were allowed only for those who belonged to a particular church. With the advent of the great nautical age and the development of navigational technology, many Catholic missionaries went to Asia and the United States as Europeans began to move to areas where they had not been able to go. In particular, missionary work in North and South America became the largest and most famous missionary project in the history of the Catholic Church. The missionaries of the Catholic Church all belonged to the nuns and were sent under the order of the nuns. An early missionary project in the United States was carried out without the restrictions of the state, as a kind of multinational organization could perform beyond the limits of the state. However, when countries such as Spain and Portugal established a solid colonial system in the United States, the existence of the missionary work of the unconstrained nuns was disturbed, and they began to restrict themselves with repeated conflicts. Since the 15th century, there have been Franciscans and Dominicans who sent missionaries around the world, and in the 16th century, the newly born Jesuits began to stand out. The \"adaptation policy\" practiced by Jesuits in missionary missions in China, India and Asia was an unimaginable breakthrough for Europeans at the time to adapt themselves to the local culture, rather than pushing the style of Europe, and it was a great success, but it eventually became frustrated because of the intervention of foreign governments with interests in the trade business and conflicts with opposition forces within the Catholic Church that saw the Jesuit radicalization. In the latter half of the 19th century, the missionary spirit increased again, and in addition to the traditional religious society, the new religious society such as the Saregio Society actively dispatched missionaries. In the Orthodox Church, as well as in the Russian Orthodox Church, there was an avid Eastern missionary activity. The missionaries of the Orthodox Church preached to Siberia, Alaska, and others, learning local languages, translating the Bible, and performing local liturgy to acquire converts.",

        "paragraph": "A missionarius or missionary is a person sent by Jesus Christ or the Church to convey the gospel. A clerk sent by the Christian Church for a foreign mission. In the second edition of the World Encyclopedia, it is explained in a broad sense that it refers to a person who is widely engaged in Christian society education and (Christian) social welfare business, i.e. a person who is dispatched from a church and engaged in such (Christian) business, including a general believer of a Christian society, and in a narrow sense, especially a person who is dispatched to a foreign church among priests and ministers. According to the Lausanne oath of the Lausanne World Mission held in Lausanne, Switzerland in 1974 by representatives of the Christian Gospel, Christian missions were defined as \"to convey Christianity in a manner that conforms to the culture and philosophy of the target land\". The conference reiterated that the driving force of this act was not an honor or economic success, but an increase in the name of God. The model of all Christian decree is the work of Jesus Christ himself, who has been thought to be the act of God's will. Missionaries have not only been teaching but also working to improve the economic development, educational and sanitation levels of the region they were dispatched to. Traditional Christian doctrine states that these acts must be carried out as pure altruistic acts without asking for a return on the acquisition of new believers. According to documents from the World Evangelical Congress in Lausanne, the spirit of missionaries has already been found in the Genesis of the Old Testament. It is the Word of God against Abraham in Genesis 12:1-3, but God promises to give blessings to the people of the world through Abraham. In the New Testament, in The Gospel of Matthew 28:20, there is a scene in which Jesus dispatches his disciples to teach them all over the world. At the time of the first church, the first Christians introduced the teachings of Christ to non-Jews. Christianity was introduced to various parts of the Roman Empire, such as the Middle East, Europe, and Africa, or outside the Roman Empire. In the 9th century, a decree was given to the Slavic people by Cyrilus and the Metdius brothers of Constantinople.",

Because Kazakhstan's railway network was designed during the Soviet period, the railway network was designed to ignore the boundaries between republics within the Soviet Union. This has caused an abnormal situation in the route from Oral to Aktobe, now passing through the Russian territory. This also means that the railway network is not in line with the demands of modern Kazakhstan.

Several claims have also been made about religious beliefs. The complexity of Neanderthal languages is unknown, but it was possible to speak clearly. Compared to modern humans, the Neanderthals were more sturdy and their limbs were shorter in proportion. While researchers often describe these features as adaptations for keeping heat in colder regions, they may have been adaptations for sprinting in warmer, more forested landscapes where Neanderthals often lived. Nevertheless, they had specific adaptations to cold regions, such as the storage of special body fats and the bloat of the nose against warm air (the nose may have been caused by genetic drift). The average Neanderthal male is 165 cm tall and the female is 153 cm tall, similar to modern humans before the industrial revolution. The average brain sacs of Neanderthal men and women are about 1,600 cm3 (98 cu in) and 1,300 cm3 (79 cu in) respectively, which are within the range of modern human values. The total population of Neanderthals remained small and could not form an effective long-distance network by proliferating weakly venomous genes. Nevertheless, there was evidence of local culture, which led to regular communication between communities. The Neanderthals may have visited the cave frequently and moved between the caves each season.

He was a vassal of the Shimotsuke-Utsunomiya clan. The Hoga clan was a descendant of the Kiyohara clan. He was the leader of Seito, a powerful samurai group in Shimotsuke Province, and was called Kisei and Kito along with the Kito of the Masuko clan. He was born as a child of Kagetaka HOSHIGA. After his father Kagetaka died in 1497, he succeeded to the headship of the Hoga clan. At that time, the Utsunomiya family was divided into two factions, the Utsunomiya Naritsuna faction and the Hoga Kagetaka faction, and confronted each other. It is said that, together with his family head Naritsuna, Hoju-in Temple was relocated to its present location (present-day Maoka City, Tochigi Prefecture) and changed its name to Kaicho-ji Temple. He donated Kosai-ji Temple within the branch temple of Shimotsuke Province to Hoju-in Temple (Hoju-an Temple) in 1510. As with his father in his later years, Takakatsu neglected his lord, Naritsuna, and prospered violently. There was also a situation of the reversal of the master-in-chief, which was to issue the shoryo (territory) Ankan monjo without permission and to be tracked down by Naritsuna. At that time, the Hoga clan had one of the largest shoryo (territory) in the family with 30,000 koku (or 60,000 koku (crop yields) including the Kiyoto clan), and although they were vassals, their military power was comparable to that of the master family. In 1506, when the Eisho War broke out, in which Masauji ASHIKAGA, Furukawa kubo, and his son Takamoto conflicted over the head of the family, Takakatsu intervened in the battle of the Furukawa kubo family and supported Masauji. However, the family head, Naritsuna UTSUNOMIYA, supported Takamoto, and the division of the family became decisive. It is said that there was also a small private school. His lord, Naritsuna, feared that the Utsunomiya family did not agree with him, and he also concentrated his power on himself, and decided to subjugate the purge of the Hoga clan. Naritsuna had enough force to overthrow the Hoga clan. In 1512, Takakatsu was concerned about the quantity of Naritsuna's equipment and forced Tadatsuna, the legitimate son of Naritsuna, to inherit the family estate and forced Naritsuna to retire. In the same year, he was murdered by Naritsuna in Utsunomiya-jo Castle. This incident caused a great internal conflict called the Utsunomiya Disturbance, and the Hoga clan fought against the Utsunomiya clan.",

However, unlike the 'old type' in Japan, traditional characters are still commonly used as standard characters in Taiwan and Hong Kong. In terms of individual characters, some traditional characters are the same as old characters, but others are different. Traditional typefaces according to the current norms and customs differ from those of typefaces that have been carried out since the Meiji period in Japan in many ways, such as typefaces and design aspects. Unlike simplified Chinese characters in the Chinese continent, there has been a long-standing absence of strict norms for kanji characters that are compulsory in the traditional Chinese characters category. Depending on the customs and language policy of each region, there is a difference in the character type of individual characters. The current standard is used in elementary education textbooks. Other types of fonts, such as printed typefaces and computer fonts, do not necessarily use the same typefaces as the norms in other parts of the world. Although both Taiwan and Hong Kong are traditional Chinese-speaking countries, there are differences in the usage and type of kanji, even though they are not spoken. In Hong Kong, it is written as '\u66f8' and '\u7740,' but in Taiwan, it is generally written as '\u66f8' without distinguishing it. On the other hand, in Taiwan, '\u53f0' and '' are written separately, but in Hong Kong, '\u53f0' is written uniformly. In Taiwan, '' and '\u885b' are the norms, but in Hong Kong, '\u88cf' and '' are the norms. In addition, there is a small difference that can be said to be about the difference in the design of the type. In general, traditional characters are applied to print standard characters called 'shinji-gata,' similar to simplified characters, and as a result, they are sometimes different from those in Taiwan and Hong Kong. For example, '' is '' in the continent. Traditional Chinese fonts have been based on the Big5-1984 set of basic characters. Products on the market in Japan are often limited to the Big5-1984 range. In Hong Kong and elsewhere, font makers sold their own expanded products.",

In particular, it is called \"simplified character\" in contrast to the \"character reform\" policy of the People's Republic of China. It is now used mainly in Taiwan, as well as in Hong Kong Macau, a special administrative district of the People's Republic of China, and is also found in the Chinese community outside of China. It is similar to the \"old type\" in Japan, but it is not the same. Since the 1980s, it has been considered that the typefaces and usages differ from region to region, and since the 1980s, the typeface has been closer to the typeface than the typefaces that were commonly seen in the typeface. The Chinese notation system based on traditional Chinese characters is called Hanyu Chubun or Shojo Chubun in Chinese, and in Japan it is called Traditional Chinese or Traditional Chinese (direct translation from English). Both letters and notation systems are sometimes abbreviated as \u7e41 or \u6b63. In English, traditional Chinese characters are commonly referred to as Traditional Chinese characters, and the notation system is referred to as Traditional Chinese. There is also a way of calling traditional Chinese characters in the Kanji area. In Chinese, orthography refers to the standard type of character. There is a claim that, mainly in Taiwan, it is wrong to call traditional characters 'kotaiji' (traditional Chinese characters) for simplified characters, and that the name 'gentaiji' is accurate. Eikyu MA, who was the leader of the Republic of China, is known as a representative of this theory. In a speech in 2004, when he was the mayor of Taipei, he stated that the term 'kotaiji' was used in the Chinese continent when kanji was simplified, and that the negative evaluation that led to '' was irrational and wrong due to the dark, and that it was an orthodox character that was handed down from ancient times as a reason to be called 'gentaiji,' and compared it with simplified characters, secular characters, and heterogeneous characters. Against this backdrop, it is sometimes referred to as 'Shoniji' or 'Shoni Chubun,' especially those held in Taiwan. The Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China distinguishes the characters according to the norms established by the same section from 'Seihoji' in addition to \"Standard Characters\" in \"Standard Characters Simplified Letters\" and 'Shunjiji' in the Chinese continent.",

According to one theory, his relationship with Nobusada, his uncle of the Sakurai Matsudaira family, deteriorated after the attack on Uri-jo Castle. It is said that Kiyoyasu overthrew Nobusada because his support was delayed when he lost his uncle, Chikamori, of the Fukugama Matsudaira family, who attacked Ote-mon Gate in the Battle of Uri-jo Castle. In 1530, he re-entered Owari Province, dropped Iwasaki-jo Castle, took Iwasaki-go (Iwazaki-cho, Hishin City), took Shinano-jo Castle, and took Shinano-go (Shinano-cho, Seto City).

According to the Iranian Encyclopedia, the number of garrisons was about 700, with about 2,000 men in another position, but modern historians agree with the estimates of Allianos, Diodorus of Sicily, and Quintus Rufus. Persis's ambush was only two meters wide. When the Macedonian army made sufficient progress on this narrow road, the Persians were struck with stones from the northern slopes. From the south slope, Persian archers fired arrows. Alexander's army was initially heavily damaged and lost all his platoons. The Macedonians attempted to withdraw, but this terrain and the rear forces were advancing, so they were unable to maintain discipline and withdraw. Alexander was forced to leave the dead to defend the rest of the army. Leaving the wounded and not burying the dead was a major disgrace for Greece and Macedonia. It is believed that there are several reasons for Ariobalzanes' change of course. The obstruction of the route through the Persis Gate of Alexandrus forced the Macedonians to take another route in order to invade Persia. This gave Darius time to deploy another army, which could have completely stopped the invasion of Macedonia. Ariobalzanes held the road for a month, but Alexander, along with Philotas, intercepted and besieged the Persians, breaking through the Persian defenses. Alexandrus and his savage men raided Ariobalzane's army from above until the Persians were unable to block the road. The description of how Alexander carried out the attack is very varied. According to Quintus and Allianos, the prisoners of war led Alexander to the mountains behind the Persian army, and the rest of the troops remained in Macedonian camps under Clateros. The Persians fought in a memorable battle until their armament was lifted. The Macedonians besieged the Persians, captured the armed men, dragged them to the ground, and stabbed them with weapons.

In the winter of 330 BC, Ariobalzanes attempted his last resistance against the Macedonian army, which outnumbered the Persis Gate near Persepolis. Alvarzaneos maintained Persepolis from Macedonia for a month. Alexander, informed by local shepherds and prisoners, eventually found a way to the rear of the Persian army and captured Persepolis. The Persian Empire was defeated by the Macedonian army at the Battle of Granikos (334 BC), the Battle of Issus (333 BC), and the Battle of Gaugamera (331 BC), and Alexander III advanced to Babylon and Susa by the end of 331 BC. The king's road connects Susa with Persepolis and Pasargadae in Persis, which became the site of Alexander's expedition. Darius III, on the other hand, formed a new army in Ekbatana (present-day Hamadan, western Iran). In order to prevent the Macedonian invasion of Persis, Ariobalzanes relied on the interests of places where Alexander needed to go. There were only a few paths to pass through the Zagros Mountains, and all roads were dangerous due to the arrival of winter. After the conquest of Susa, Alexander divided the Macedonian army into two, one led by Alexander's general, Parmenion, and marched half the way through the king's path, and the other led by Alexander himself in the direction of Persis. In order to proceed to Persis, it was necessary to pass through the Persis gate. The Persis Gate was a narrow mountain road, ideal for ambush. Alexander conquered the tribe of Uxian during his advance. Uxian was a tribe of local hills who demanded the same tributes as those given by the king of Persia in order to pass by safely. While passing through it to the gate of Persis, Alexander did not meet any resistance. Alexander did not send any scouts to the course, believing that he would never encounter any more enemy forces during his advance. Alexander's army then stepped into the ambush of Ariobalzanes. There was a valley ahead of the Persis Gate. Ariobalzanes allowed the Macedonian army to enter the mountain range. The Persis gate, then known as the Tang e Mayarran, was initially a broad road. Ariobalzanes took up the position near the present-day village of Cheshme Chaina. The road was bent southeastward, and the site was so narrow and terrestrially dangerous that it met the purpose of Ariobalzanes.",

He was born in Kurashiki City. He was the third Korean to live in Japan, and his grandfather was Koyo SORANando, South Korea. Although he was a member of Tokyo Korean Higher School, he chose to go to Rissho University because he needed to be qualified to graduate from Ichijo School in order to be certified as a \"athlete who does not treat as a foreign national\" in the J-League. During his time at school, he was found by the staff of Albirex Niigata who was checking his senior, Kenji Nii, and joined Niigata in 2002. In Niigata, he played an active role as a midfielder and contributed to the promotion of the J2 to the J1 championship in 2003. After promotion, he played as the main player of the team in 2004 and moved to Nagoya Grand Passage in 2005. In 2006, he moved to Busan Eye Park in the South Korean K-League. It was unusual to play in the K-League while still registered in Korea as a player. On September 22, 2007, the opponent's elbows hit the lower abdomen of the lower abdomen in contact with the opponent's DF in the league's fight against Jonan Ichiwa, leaving the battle line with injuries that damage 1/3 of the kidneys. Immediately after his return, he was traded to Mizuhara Sansei Blue Wings for Yasusada from the 2008 season. However, he did not have a chance to compete in only nine games because he was out of the defense plan of Hanne, the director of Mizuhara's car. The team won the league championship, but it was an unwilling season for Yasu himself. After the end of the season, Mizuhara was announced and decided to leave South Korea, but as a result of the finale, the car manager showed difficulty with the transfer, the 2009 season remained in Mizuhara. However, this season was not enough for him, and he ended up playing 14 games. In June of the 2010 FIFA World Cup, he moved to Omiya Aldija and returned to the J.

In the past, it was often made by using both rice bran and barley bran, called Koshu miso, which were handmade in each family.

In 2007, it was selected by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries as one of the '100 local dishes of agricultural and mountain fishing villages' selected from among the tastes of hometowns handed down throughout the country. There used to be a culture in Yamanashi that said, 'You can't marry a woman if you don't want to.' Basically, it is a kind of dish served while it is hot by kneading flour and stewing thick and short noodles with miso-made soup along with vegetables such as pumpkin. It is not necessarily a form of noodle dish, for example, in some regions there are small chunks that are easy to use grains other than flour, seasoned with small beans or soy sauce instead of miso, and noodles are cooked without cooling. Also, in order to be easy to eat when eating out, noodles are thin, meat and marine products are added in addition to vegetables, etc. It is rare to take a method of cooking noodles boiled like ordinary udon noodles by adding various ingredients and seasonings such as miso. There is a local dish called 'Yoshida no Udon,' which has the same powdered food culture as Hoto, in the county area of Fuji-hokuto. In addition, there is a dish called 'hoto-nabe' in general outside of the prefecture. The common name is 'Hoto.' In some areas, it is sometimes called 'Ohoto' or 'Nikomi' (a part of the area in Uchi-gun, Yamanashi Prefecture) or 'Noshikomi' (a part of the Uchikawachi region in Yamanashi Prefecture). The buckwheat dough is made by kneading flour with a wooden kneadpot ('gonbachi' in folklore vocabulary), and the finished dough is stretched using a sawdust stick, folded up and chopped wide with a kitchen knife 2]. Unlike Udon noodles, the dough does not require noodles to produce gluten, and there are few methods to make the dough sleep. In addition, since it does not knead salt, there is no procedure to remove salt by boiling noodles in hot water, and it is characterized by boiling noodles from the state of raw noodles. For this reason, the soup is soaked with soy sauce. Today, it is often used because it is mainly used in Yamanashi Prefecture because fresh noodles exclusively for bean sprouts are circulated.

He worked on mine surveys in the United States and Canada, and on railroad construction in Nigeria, which was the protectorate of Cuba and the United Kingdom, but his life seems to have been unpleasant, and he later recalled, \"I hated everything for a moment.\" In 1912, he married American Flora Small and moved to New York, where he posted short stories and columns in newspapers and magazines while serving as a member of the British Ministry of Information. After the birth of his eldest daughter Elizabeth Elizabeth and her eldest son Colin, he became a volunteer for the British Army Irishgars Regiment in 1916 and went to the Western Front in World War I, where he suffered from the sight of wounded military horses being shot and killed without being treated, writing the story of Dr. John D'Little, a doctor who could speak the words of animals he created in a letter to two children. The story's protagonist, Dr. John Donnie, is said to have been modeled after Colin, who liked his father's story and called himself \"Dr. Donnie\". Lofting was wounded in 1917 and sent back to Ireland, but decided to relocate to the United States to escape the fire of the Irish Revolutionary War, which broke out in 1919.",

He made his debut at the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1946. Suddenly, he became Honjouchi no Okimi. In 1947 and 1949, it exceeded 50. Two 50 bases have been the third ever since Babe Ruth and Jimmy Fox, and the first National League player. He won the title of Honjouchi no Okimi for seven consecutive years from his debut to 1952. In particular, in 1949, 54 copies were in sixth place in Thailand, with only two in the National League record. In addition, there were many four death balls, and for the fourth consecutive year from 1947, he recorded '40 hits - 100 four death balls.' It reached 200 hits in 1950, the 702nd game and the fastest record of the time (a MLB record until it was surpassed by Ryan Howard in 2009). However, his back and back pain prevented him from hitting, and he moved to the Chicago Cubs in mid-1953 and to the Cleveland Indians in 1955, retiring at the age of 32. The Cabs release is said to have been due to the frequent incongruity between the Pirates GM's Branch Ricky and the yearly ties. In fact, there is an episode that GM told me at the time of the trade. It is said that he beat Babe Ruth's record if he had been active for a long time, although he had hit a total of 369 hits in 10 years. The \"Kiner's Corner\" at Forbes Field, the home of the Pirates at the time, changed his name to \"Greenberg Garden\", a special seat created on the left wing fence for former teammate Hank Greenberg, who was a newcomer. It was a seat to reduce the length of the left fence from 405 feet (111 m) to 335 feet (102 m) and take advantage of the right batter's Greenberg, but Greenberg retired a year after his transfer to Pirates, and Kayner was rewarded. After Kayner's transfer to Cabs, the seat was removed and the stadium returned to its original size. After his retirement, he began his career as a commentator at the Chicago White Sox in 1961, and in 1962, he worked as a radio and television commentator for the New York Mets for 52 years until his death.",

The revolution in Italy also affected what was later known as \"uncollected Italy\", in which Dalmatian Italian writer Niccolo Tonmazeo joined the Veneto Republic and the Italian historian Carlo de Franceschi of Istria appealed to the national arousal of the Dalmatian Italians. In the July monarchy, which was born as a result of the July Revolution of 1830, although the right to vote was expanded, the limited election by tax payment itself was maintained, and the dissatisfaction of workers and farmers who did not have the right to vote increased. These dissatisfactions were caused by a gathering called the Banquets r\u00e9formistes (a political gathering that calls for the expansion of electoral powers and the rights of workers and farmers, but was held in the name of the banquet and is famous for the Republican Alexander Rudol-Roran's propulsion in Lille), but on February 22, 1848, when the government issued an order to dissolve the reform banquet, a demonstration and strike by workers, farmers, and students who were jealous of it occurred. The following day, Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Gizo resigned and tried to calm the situation, but on the 24th it developed into an armed uprising, finally when King Louis-Philippe abdicated and fled to London to form a temporary government on the same day. With the success of the revolution, the revolution not only spread to France, but also to Europe, leading to the collapse of the Vienna system. In France, the monarchy was abolished in July, and in 1848 the Constitution was passed to the Second Republic. During the November presidential election, Louis-Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte was elected president. Later, Louis-Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte began the second imperial government in 1852. Unlike the French Revolution and the July Revolution, the revolution shifted from the former Burghoisie-led civil revolution to the Proletarian art revolution. From the beginning, the revolution was carried by socialists (such as Pierre-Joseph Prudon and Louis-Auguste Blanke), and was mixed with the French tricolour flag and red flags.",

However, only the third master's day is an exception, and on this day a rose-colored ceremonial dress is used, and it is the only organ performance allowed during the Advent. This rose-colored main day has the same meaning as the main day of the fourth main day of the fourth semester. The Catholic Encyclopedia also has the following descriptions. In the 4th Cannon (Article) of the Resolution of the Council of Salagosa in 380, it is said that such preparation period will always be attended to the church from December 17 to the Kogensai Festival. Other bishops have proposed a pre-Christmas preparation period, but it has not been legalized. At a conference held in Mason, Gaul in 581, in the ninth section, from November 11 to Christmas, the fourth semester is followed by a sacrifice to the moon, water, and gold. In 650, five Sundays were celebrated in Spain. According to several resolutions, fasting from autumn minutes was legalized from November 11 or 15 at an early stage. Marriage at this time was banned by other resolutions. Advents are also observed in the Greek Orthodox Church, according to Theodore the Studite. It is not mentioned when, but in the 8th century it can be seen that Advent was celebrated not as a prayer, but as a time of fasting and prohibition. The period from 15 November to Christmas was also shortened to 7 November, according to the Alanian chieftain Goal.",

        "paragraph": "Advent is the period of awaiting the inauguration of Jesus Christ in the Christian Western Church. In Japanese, it is called Taikosetsu, Korinsetsu, or Tatansetsu. The name differs from sect to sect, mainly in the Catholic and Lutheran churches, and in the Episcopal Church, it is called the Paradigm. The word \"Advent\" comes from the Latin word \"Adventus\", meaning \"come\". In Christianity, Advent is used to describe the arrival of Christ into the human world and the resurrection of Christ (corresponding to the Greek Parusia). In the Western Church, the year of the church begins with a waitlist. It is about four weeks from Sunday to Christmas Eve, closest to St. Angele's Day on November 30, and begins on November 27 in the earliest years and December 3 in the late years. In the late 5th century, Saint Martin's Day was designated as the start date for the pre-Christmas fasting season, but was later designated as the fourth main day during the reign of Gregory I. The first Advent is called the First Lord's Day or the First Lord's Day of the Precipitate, followed by the second, third, fourth and fourth days of the Precipitate. In the Orthodox Church, there is no concept of an advent. In the Orthodox Church, the Resurrection Day and the St. God's Paradise are designated as the Cult Calendar, and do not count the Cult Calendar on the basis of Advent, and the Apostle St. Philip's (Filipo, Pilipo, Filipos) is held for 40 days from November 14 to Christmas Eve. This is sometimes called \"Advent\" in English. However, this period is not officially called \"Advent\" in the Japanese Orthodox Church. Notes] The Orthodox calendar is originally the Julian calendar, but in the Japanese Orthodox Church, there is a church that performs Christmas in the Gregorian calendar, so the period of 'Philippe' is shortened. However, the main day before and after Christmas is a special series of festivals. For details, please refer to the section of \"Rise and Rise Festival.\" Abstract] The oldest surviving document of how to protect the advents was ordered by Perpetus, the bishop of Tour, to fast three times a week from 11 November to Christmas.",

He had three sons, Alexander II, Perdiccus III, and Philip II, and a grandson, Alexander the Great. Amuntas ascended the throne after a ten-year turmoil after the death of Charles I, but since then he has worked hard to survive the kingdom. In the year of his enthronement, Amuntas was temporarily overthrown by the Illyrians, but returned to the throne the following year with the help of the Thessalians. It is believed that it was supported by the Areuas family of Lariza, who had had a strong relationship with the royal family since the time of Archerius I. To counter the Illyrian threat of repeated intrusions into the country, Amuntas partnered with the Calcidia Alliance, which was led by the city of Olyndus, and ceded part of the territory to Olyndus in exchange for support. The timber in Olympus' territory was used to strengthen the Athenian fleet, but because of this price, the power of Olympus increased, Amundus sought other allies and cooperated with King Cotys I of Odyssey. The daughter of Cotys I was already married to Athenian general Iphicrates, so Amundus decided to adopt Iphicrates. After the peace of Antalchidas, Sparta hoped to restore his presence in northern Greece. In 385 BC, the Illyrians, led by Bardullis, attacked Ipilos with the encouragement and support of Dionysius I of Syracuse, who intended to restore King Alketa I of Epirus. Under these circumstances, Amuntas called for Sparta's help. Sparta signed a pact with Amuntas, with the motive of defeating Olympus, an emerging force in the north of Greece, supported by Athens and Thebes, rivals over Greece's hegemony. In 379 BC, Amuntas succeeded in reducing the power of Olympus with the help of Sparta. In addition, in 372 BC, Amuntas joined the alliance between Yeason and Athens, the rulers of Thessaly.",

The Moors were originally Berbers, natives of the Maggreb region. Since then, it has also been applied to Arabs and Arabized Iberians. The Moors are neither clear nor self-defining. The Britannica Encyclopedia of 1911 stated that the term \"has no ethnological value\". During the Middle Ages and early modern times, various European names were used by Arabs, Berbers and Muslims in North Africa. In Europe, it has also been used in a broader and somewhat more jealous sense of the Muslim population in Spain and North Africa, especially Arab and Berber. During the colonial period, Portuguese called South Asia and Sri Lanka the \"Seylon Moors\" and \"Indian Moors\", while Bengal Muslims were also called Moors. In the Philippines, the long-standing Muslim community before the arrival of the Spaniards is now calling themselves the \"Moro\". This is a foreign word introduced by Spanish settlers because they believe in Islam. In 711, Moorish troops in northern Africa led to the conquest of Hispania by the Umayya dynasty. The Iberian Peninsula became known as Al Andalus in classical Arabic, and at its peak it included most of septimania and the present-day Spain and Portugal. In 827, the Moors occupied Mazara del Valro on the island of Sicily and developed it as a port, eventually taking control of the rest of Sicily. Due to the differences between religion and culture, the Christian kingdom of Europe fought for centuries to regain control of Muslims. In 1224, Muslims were expelled from Sicily to the village of Lucella, which was destroyed by European Christians in 1300. With the fall of Granada in 1492, the rule of Muslims in Spain came to an end, but minority Muslims continued to exist until the expulsion in 1609.

        "paragraph": "Body mass Note 1] is the mass of a human or animal population. Weighing is often a guide to health. Weight is a very useful indicator in the screening of nutritional disorders The body mass index (BMI) can be calculated from weight and height, and obesity can be examined. The purpose of physical measurement for children is to measure with height and to investigate the developmental condition. Measuring the body weight on a regular basis and grasping the changes in the body weight can help diagnose and prevent lifestyle-related diseases. When obesity progresses too much, it becomes impossible to walk independently, and the skin can break. Also, when you are on a diet, you often weigh and have goals such as \"How many kilograms can be spent\". However, it is not clear what weight loss at this time and weight loss is just weight weighing. The thought of reducing fat is that calcium phosphate (bone) is reduced only, and muscle tissue is sometimes lost in weight. These are the result of the dissolution of nutrients stored in the form of bones and muscles, and it is not a desired result because the concentration in the blood is maintained by unreasonable weight loss. Weighing is usually measured on a scale. For patients who cannot stand up, wheelchair scales, hanging, and scale heads are also used. In the absence of weighing scales, there were not many records of ancient humans weighing because it was necessary to make extensive measurements using large scales that could be used by humans. No matter what type of weighing meter it is, the physical quantity it weighs is mass (units are kilograms), not weight (i.e. force, unit is Newton). For details, please refer to the physical quantity indicated by the scale # scale. In weightless condition, since it can not be measured with a normal scale, the momentum when the contracted spring is pushed back is measured by converting it to weight. The physical weight obtained by this method is also mass. Weight is now weighed in kilograms (kg) in most countries of the world (g) only darlings. However, in the United States, it is common to weigh with pound.",

He was a person who gained great popularity in Edo and established the foundation of the Ichikawa Danjuro family. His father was Danjuro ICHIKAWA the first, and his mother was Sokoni. When Danjuro I asked Shinsho-ji Temple on Mt. Narita (Narita Fudo) for a child treasure, he was born beautifully, so he was called 'Fudo no Yoji.' He was also familiar with haikai (Japanese haikai) and kyoka (comic poem), and his haigo (haiku title) was Sansho, Saigyo, Hakuen, and Suujo. In 1697, he first performed in \"Hinemoto Soga\" at Nakamura-za Theater as Kuzo ICHIKAWA the first. In 1704, he succeeded to the name of the second generation at the Yamamura-za Theater after the death of the first Danjuro, but it was Shingoro IJIMA, a famous actor at that time, who protected the second generation at the age of 17 who was suffering from insufficient power.

He was the third head of the Kujo family. He called himself Komyojo-ji-dono and Yodo-dono. His common name was Komyobuji Kanpaku. He built Tofuku-ji Temple at Kujo-dori Street in Kyoto. He was the father of FUJIWARA no Yoritsune, the fourth shogun of the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun). Since he was a child, he was loved by his grandfather Kanezane KUJO and was brought up by his grandfather. On February 13, 1203, he was appointed to Shogoinoge (Senior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) at the same time he celebrated his coming-of-age ceremony. After that, he continued to prosper with Jiju (chamberlain), Sakone no chujo (Middle Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards), Jusanmi (Junior Third Rank), and Gon Chunagon (provisional vice-councilor of state). In the spring of 1206, when his father, Yoshitsune, died suddenly, Michiie succeeded him. In March 1209, he made his older sister Tachiko marry her as the wife of Imperial Prince Morinari (later Emperor Juntoku). Therefore, he continued to prosper with Sakone no daisho (Major Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards), Gon Dainagon (provisional chief councilor of state), Naidaijin (Minister of the Center), and Udaijin (Minister of the Right). Furthermore, when Imperial Prince Kanenari (later Emperor Nakasu) was born between Emperor Juntoku and his older sister Tachiko, he became an assistant to the Crown Prince. Since his uncle Yoshisuke KUJO died in December 1218, he was promoted to Sadaijin (Minister of the Left). This was largely due to the fact that he became a maternal relative of the Imperial family and that his father, Kintsune SAIONJI, had a deep relationship with the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun). In January 1219, when MINAMOTO no Sanetomo, the third shogun, was assassinated by his nephew's son-in-law, Michiie's mother became Yoritomo's nephew, so the third son of Yoshitoki HOJO and later FUJIWARA no Yoritsune were asked to become the fourth shogun.

In April 1221, Emperor Juntoku abdicated the throne to Imperial Prince Kanenari and became the Retired Emperor, and Imperial Prince Kanenari (at the age of two) ascended the throne to become Emperor Nakasu, and Michiie became Sessho (regent) to serve as his maternal uncle. However, the Jokyu War was caused by the Retired Emperor Gotoba on the occasion of the power relationship of the Imperial Court collapsed due to the death of Sanetomo.",

Another king, Macehead, found in Hieraconpolis in Upper Egypt, has a pharaoh (Skorpion), whose name is unknown, along with a painting of a scorpion, and it is not known whether they are the same person or not. According to Manetto, it was Menes who united Egypt, and neither Narmel nor Scorpion nor Menes were the same person. As the successor of Narmel, he became the next king, Hol Aha, who is said to have been placed between the Queen Nato and Tep, and has the name \"Men\" as the unified name (Nevti name) of Upper and Lower Egypt. Men\" means \"established\", and his name can be seen in the capital of Memphis. There are also many researchers who regard Hol Aha as Menes because he was connected with Maneto's first king of the unified dynasty, Menes. The reign of gel (Atotis), the successor of Holl Aha, is believed to have lasted for 57 years, and there are more than 300 men's graves around gel's grave in Abidos. Afterwards, it is said that Jessie ruled, but according to a survey of the graves of Avids, Mernait, Queen of Gerr, may have carried out regency alone or in a short period during the reign of Gerr and Gert. However, Manetto stated that women were only allowed to take the throne after the time of the 2nd dynasty's Nietzschel. During the Den era, the ivory label was described as \"the first to punish the east\" and confirmed contact with Asians. During the era of Mysevius, the royal family was divided into north-south regions and fought a great deal. After the war, Semerket entered the reign of Semerket, but there is a theory that Semerket was a thief of the throne because his name was not included in the list of kings excavated from the grave of Tenroy in Saccara, and he had erased the name of Azilbe from some excavated articles.",

In the past, the list of Pharaohs has been carried out with various historical relics such as Trino papyrus written in the imperial period, \"Egyptian History\" written by the historian Maneto of the 3rd century BC, and the list of Pharaohs left in the cemetery and Palermo stones of Seti I. However, all of these information is fragmentary and contradictory, so the contents vary greatly depending on references and materials. The list of pharaohs described in this article is basically based on the ancient Egyptian pharaoh journal written by Egyptian archaeologist Peter Clayton and John E. Moby's General Exposition of the Kings of the World, and supplementary and different descriptions shall be added in separate footnotes. Since it is difficult to restore the genealogy of pharaohs in the first and second middle periods, and the debate continues today, it is also referenced in the description of \"Egyptian historical dynasty history with full genealogy\" by the relatively new Japanese translation material, Adan Dodson. In addition, the Japanese notation and the English notation in the list were followed by \"Knowledge of Ancient Egypt\" by Sakuji YOSHIMURA. The classification of ages, as well as the list of pharaohs, varies from source to source, and this article is based on Clayton's classification. Maneto divided the period between the end of 4000 BC and 332 BC, when Egypt was thought to have been unified, into 30 dynasties, which are based on modern Egyptian historical studies. The 31st Dynasty from 343 BC was the second rule of Persia, and the 32nd Dynasty was the reign of Macedonia from 332 BC and the Ptolemy period. Regarding the age itself, Clayton said that it was certain from the time of the 26th dynasty Psamtech I in 664 BC, when it was connected to the Mediterranean civilization, and that earlier dates may have been error-prone in 20 to 200 years. The early dynastic period can be divided into two parts: the first dynastic period from 3150 BC to about 3050 BC and the second dynastic period from around 2686 BC.",

        "paragraph": "Alexander III persuaded him to relinquish, but broke in front of Caranos' strong will, and made Ptolemy build a crematorium to fulfill Caranos's demands. This happened in Susa in 323 BC. Caranos was also recorded by Alexander III's admiral, Nearchus, and Carles of Mitilini. The others were afraid to see Carrenos burn down and die, but Carrenos himself was not annoyed. Before he died on the crematorium, he left Alexander III with the last words, \"We will meet in Babylon.\" Therefore, it is said that Calenos foresaw Alexander III's death in Babylon. At the time of Carrenos' death, Alexander III did not plan to go to Babylon. No one could understand Carrenos's will at that time, but only after Alexander III fell ill in Babylon and died, the Greeks realized his true intentions. The causes of Alexander III's death are various theories, such as alcoholic liver disease, fever, and strykinine poisoning, but only a few historical sources can prove them. In 1998, the University of Maryland School of Medicine published a theory that Alexander III died of typhoid fever. Along with malaria, this disease was a common disease in ancient Babylon. A week before Alexander's death, it was recorded that he had symptoms of cold, sweating, fatigue, and high fever. These are typical symptoms of infectious diseases such as typhoid fever. According to David W. Oldach of the Medical Center at the University of Maryland, Alexander III was also suffering from \"heavy abdominal pain\" and therefore \"crying with pain\". However, this is based on the unreliable description of Alexander Romance. Andrew N. Williams and Robert Arnott believe that Alexander III could not speak out in the last few days. Alexander III claimed that his neck was wounded in the siege of Culropolis, and that his voice was lost. Other major causes of Alexander III's death are the theory of malaria and the theory of poisoning. According to his condition, there is also a theory that refers to non-infectious diseases.",

        "paragraph": "In the death of Alexander III, he disputed the events and disputes about the death of Alexander III of Macedonia, also known as the Great King. According to Babylonian astronomical journals, Alexander III died between the sunset of 10 June 323 BC and the sunset of 11 June 323 BC. At this time, he was 32 years old. It was the palace of Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon. The Macedonians and the locals wept in contact with the intelligence, and the former Hukamanish tribes, who were conquered, shaved their heads. The last Hakarmanish king, Darius III's mother, Sishganbis, died a few days later after hearing of Alexander's death. Although several primary sources have documented Alexander III's death, his reputation varies from historian to historian, and many theories have been proposed for the death itself. In February 323 BC, Alexander III led his troops to Babylon. According to Allianos, the Caldians came across the Tigris River and told him that Bale had warned Alexander III that if he entered the city of Babylon, it would be a life-threatening situation. The Caldeans also warned Alexander III, who was advancing westward, that it was as if he had seen the sunset, the symbol of the fall. Instead, they recommended entering Babylon to the east from the gate of the king on the west side of Babylon. Alexander III tried to follow suit, but his journey was a swampy, unsuitable terrain for the advance. According to Jona Rendering, \"perhaps in May 323 BC\", Babylonian astrologists tried to get ordinary people to sit on the throne in Babylonia instead of Alexander III, warding off God and preventing the king's misfortunes. However, the Greeks could not understand the true meaning of the ceremony. Caranos is said to have been one of the Baramon monks of Hinduism (from the Greeks he was called Gumno Sopistai or \"Nude Philosopher\"). In response to Alexander III's request, he accompanied his expeditionary forces on their way home from Panjab. However, he was weakened by the weather of Persis and the fatigue of the trip, and thought that he would die rather than live as a vagrant, so he burned himself down and committed suicide.",

In the United States, sales begin at the end of the year on Friday (Black Friday) the day after the traditional Thanksgiving festival, and stores are crowded with shoppers during Thanksgiving holidays. After that, it\u2019s called Cyber Monday, as online shop sales are skyrocketing next Monday by people returning to their homes and workplaces during Thanksgiving holidays. The term began to be used by the National Retail Association's Ellen Davis and Scott Silverman during the 2005 holiday season. The increase in online shop sales on Cyber Monday is said to be due to the large number of people accessing and shopping e-commerce sites using high-speed lines at work on Mondays during the period when Internet access in private homes was poor, such as dial-up connections, and also because people who went out to and went back to shopping in their stores during Thanksgiving holidays go back to their homes and shop online. And, of course, the fact that online shops make a big sale in the name of Cyber Monday is one of the reasons for the huge increase in sales. Online shop sales are up a lot on Cyber Monday, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re slowing down at the peak, and they\u2019ll continue to generate strong sales over the holiday season. The 2011 holiday season saw a total of 10 days of online sales exceeding $1 billion per day, led by Cyber Monday\u2019s $1. In 2007, online shop sales were $733 million on Cyber Monday, up 84% on average for the previous four weeks. For the first time in its history, 2010 saw online revenue exceeding $1 billion per day to $1. As brick-and-mortar stores are crowded during Thanksgiving holidays, more and more consumers are shopping online on Cyber Monday instead of shopping at brick-and-mortar stores. In 2006, Shop.org announced the launch of the CyberMonday.com portal, which allows you to run a shop where you can trade on Cyber Monday right away. Cyber Monday has become an international marketing term used by online retailers in Canada, the UK, Portugal, Germany and Chile. In Japan, in 2012, Amazon.co.jp applied for the second Monday of December as a Japanese Cyber Monday and was certified by the Japan Anniversary Association.",

He also visited the Muromachi bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) and worshipped Yoshiteru ASHIKAGA, the thirteenth shogun. From 1540 to the following year, in order to transfer from Ise-jingu Shrine to Ise-jingu Shrine, he presented lumber and 700 kanmon coins. It is said that he was appointed to Mikawa no kami (Governor of Mikawa Province) by the Imperial Court as a reward for this, but there are no examples of his being used around him. Furthermore, in 1543, he presented 4000 kanmon as repair fees to the Imperial Court due to the demolition of the dairi building due to a storm in 1541, and showed an emphasis on the Imperial Court (according to \"Tamonin Nikki\"). On the other hand, in 1529, Kiyoyasu MATSUDAIRA invaded Owari and seized Shinano-jo Castle in Higashi-Kasugai-gun and Iwasaki-jo Castle in Aichi-gun, which were under the control of Nobuhide. Furthermore, he was attacked by the Imagawa army and invaded Moriyama in 1535, but Kiyoyasu was killed by his vassal Masatoyo ABE due to the collapse of Moriyama. As a result, Nobuhide attacked Mikawa against the Matsudaira clan, which had been dispersed. In 1540, he captured Ansho-jo Castle and took control of it (the Battle of Anjo, the First Battle of Anjo), and his eldest son (a illegitimate child) Nobuhiro ODA was placed. In 1542, Yorinari TOKI, a Shugo (provincial constable), and his son Yoritsugu TOKI were expelled to Owari by Dosan SAITO. Nobuhide supported Yorinari and, in cooperation with Takakage ASAKURA, who had a son of Yorizumi TOKI, a former Shugo (provincial constable) who was expelled from Echizen Province as well, dispatched troops to Mino Province to fight against Dosan SAITO and temporarily robbed Ogaki-jo Castle.

Nobusada was a member of the Oda clan, the shugodai (the provincial constable) of Owari Province, and as a branch family serving the shugodai (provincial constable) 'Oda Yamato no kami family' (the Kiyosu-Oda clan), who ruled four counties under Owari Province, he succeeded to the family of one of the three chief retainers of the main family, Kiyosu no Sanbugyo (the three magistrates of Kiyosu Province), who called himself Danshochu. During the Taiei era (1521 - 1521), he built Katsuhata-jo Castle, controlled Tsushima, which was prosperous as a port facing the Kiso-gawa River near Ise Bay and a gate town of Ushigashira Tenno-sha Shrine (Tsushima-jinja Shrine), and created an opportunity to expand the power of the family. Nobuhide was given the position of head of the family from April 1526 to June 1527, before his father Nobusada's death, and became the head of the family. Shortly after his succession to the family headship, in 1532, he fought against Tatsukatsu ODA, the head family, and Tozaemon ODA of Odai-jo Castle, one of the three magistrates of Qingzhou, but he reconciled. In order to strengthen this peace treaty, Masatsuna ASUKAI, the head family of the Kemari family, was invited from Kyoto in July 1533, and Tokitsugu YAMASHINA, along with him, held a kemari party at Katsuhata-jo Castle on July 8, and many people gathered, including a few hundred spectators, and on July 27, he moved to Seishu-jo Castle and held a kemari party (\"Tokitsugu Kyoki\" (The Diary of Tokitsugu YAMASHINA)). In 1534, his legitimate son Nobunaga was born. Around 1538, he robbed Nakono-jo Castle (Naka Ward, Nagoya City) where Ujitoyo IMAGAWA resided, and moved his residence here to Aichi County (around the present Nagoya City area). Following the expansion of power, he built Koto-jo Castle (Naka Ward, Nagoya City) in 1539 and ruled the second economic base, Atsuta, as his residence. At the time of Nobunaga's childhood, he handed over Nakono-jo Castle before his coming-of-age ceremony in 1546.",

The FSFI was actively involved in women's competitions at the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam. The FSFI continued to negotiate with the IOC and the IAAF in an attempt to increase the number of active species, but it failed, and the function was absorbed by the IAAF and disappeared. The IAAF has a history of doping measures, including approval of the doping rules at the 1928 general meeting and prohibition of the use of excitants, organizing the Medical Committee at the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, starting a flat-time inspection of athletes in 1989, and requiring all contestants to perform blood tests after the 2011 World Championships. Examples of doping for track and field athletes include organized doping by socialist states such as East Germany in the 1980s, deprivation of Ben Johnson's qualifications, and the Balco scandal. In the Charter, the IAAF promotes fair play and eliminates doping, and today it works closely with WADA to promote anti-doping. As of 2011, the IAAF has a Board of Directors, a First Vice-President, a Vice-President, three Vice-Presidents, an Honorary Account, six Regional Representatives, 15 Council Members, and one Secretary-General.

In June 1912, after the end of the Stockholm Olympics, a meeting was held in Stockholm, where seventeen delegates from around the world asked for accreditation of the rules and international governing body for athletics. The IAAF was founded by the 1st General Assembly, attended by Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Chile, Denmark, Egypt, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Norway, Russia, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The IAAF held its second General Assembly in Berlin in 1913 and adopted the Charter, which was chaired by Siegfried Edstr\u00f6m and headquartered in Stockholm. Some sources state that the IAAF was founded by the 2nd General Assembly in Berlin. The headquarters moved to London in 1946 and to Monaco in October 1993. The IAAF established competition rules in 1914 and began accrediting the world record. At the 1912 Olympic Games in Stockholm, stopwatches were used for manual clocking at 1/10th of a second, but the clocking technology developed over the years, and the 1964 Olympic Games in Tokyo began to measure electric clocks using quartz clocks by 1/100th of a second in 1972. In 1977, the IAAF was required to measure up to 1/100th of a second by electric time as a world record certification condition of less than 400 meters.",

        "paragraph": "The people of the pre-existing society (a society that does not receive the sensibility of modern civilization) are doing production activities as well as modern people who have been civilized in the past and today. Whether the form of production is hunting or farming, people acquire means of living and distribute it to members of the community. Although the production activities of unexplored people and the \"work\" of modern people seem to be the same, it is different from those of modern people that there was no way to interpret the production activities alive. For the producers of the prehistoric society, production activities live on religion, art, and ethics, and are by no means the \"work\" of the civilized people. As described in Hesiodos's literature, agricultural activity was a religious act at the same time, as well as an ethics superimposed on the community's norms. It was not \"work\" in the modern sense. In addition, the production activities of the craftsmen who were active in the ancient Greekpolis were called Tekne and Poiesis, but it was the act of meeting the situation in which the nature of things appeared, making sustainable useful objects, confirming their position in a closed universe through it, and being approved by others. In other words, it was not 'work to conquer nature by means of tools' as modern people say. In the Book of the Old Testament, Chapter 3 and 19 of the Genesis, it is sometimes explained that labor was a punishment to Adam by God. Protestants found the concept of tenshoku, which recognized the value of labor itself. In this position, it is recommended to invest by saving greed and suppressing consumption. Max Weber was among those who believed that the ethics of this kind of Protestantism enabled capitalism as a historical system. However, according to the views of Swiss religious reformers, during the Reformation of Christianity in the 16th century (the late Middle Ages), there was a background in which \"true Christians had to insist strongly on the virtues of diligence and ecclesiasticality\" in order to counter the Roman Church's \"extraordinary philanthropy of giving mercy\". Due to its influence, European states were regarded as \"the holy thing of labor\" and \"the will of God to work\", and those who did not work were regarded as the treason of God and the state (the treason of the state).",

A certain process involved in the relationship between human beings and nature, and the process in which human beings control their relationship with nature and form valuable objects by their own actions, is called \"work\". Human beings have lived through some kind of production activity in any part of the world, from ancient to modern times. It was not until the modern times that such production activities began to be interpreted as 'work.' Production activity has always been associated with some kind of representation system (a system of semantics). There is not a difference between the actual production actions that humans are doing and the representation that encompasses it, but it exists as one. In other words, if there is some kind of production activity, it will be accompanied by words that interpret and express it, and it is thought that these words incorporate a specific history and a world image. Talking about labor\u201d is also talking about the expression of labor that is woven into words. To have a relationship with nature through production activities is to live with the interpretation of the world that is unique to a certain period, such as the one that appears at the end of such a representation. (=#history) A person with the ability to work is called a labor force. The largest percentage of the workforce is employed by workers, with more than 75% of the EU's workforce being employed. In capitalist society, labor came to be considered not an activity of ethical character, but an unavoidable pain to keep workers alive. In Marxism, \"in a capitalist society, many people (i.e. the working class) who have no means of production are forced to sell their labor as commodities and are exploited by the owner of the means of production (i.e. the capitalist class) to produce surplus value in the production process.\" (=#history) At present, the International Labor Organization aims to achieve the ideal form of labor: the work of a person who is happy to work.",

        "paragraph": "The three characteristics that a spring has, or is required by a spring, are roughly divided into three characteristics, which are also referred to as the \"three major characteristics of a spring\". In addition to the parts and objects called springs, these three characteristics are provided, but it can be said that springs use these characteristics particularly well. There are other basic properties of springs and different ways of working, but note 1), along with these three main categories, we will explain the basic characteristics of springs. The spring has the property that when applied, it deforms, and when removed, it returns to its original form. Having the property of trying to return to the original even if the force is formed and deformed in this way is the basic property of the spring, and is a necessary condition. The power to return to its original form is called \"restore power\", and the presence of restore power is one of the main characteristics of springs. The restoration force is due to the property of \"elasticity\" of the substance, and the deformation that returns to the original shape when the force is removed is called \"elastic deformation\". However, when the force (to be precise, stress) is applied beyond the limit of the material, the deformation (to be precise, strain) remains even if the force is excluded. This property is called \"plasticity\", and the deformation that does not return due to the nature of plasticity is called \"plastic deformation\". The maximum stress at which the deformation stays in the elastic deformation is called the \"elastic limit\". Since springs are used on the assumption that they return to their original state, plastic deformation is not desirable, and they are generally used to the extent that the force applied to the spring does not exceed the elastic limit. The deformation of springs and the amount of deformation are called 'wami.' There are two types of physical units of deflection: displacement (change in length) and rotational angle (change in twisting and bending angles). In compression coil springs that make use of the change in length, the units of deflection are represented by displacement. In the torsion bar where the torsion angle of the rod is changed, the unit of deflection is a rotation angle (torsion angle). Depending on the physical quantity of the deflection, there are several types of loads that cause the deflection. If it is displaced, it is a load (pure force), and if it is a torsion angle, a torsion moment can be considered.",

        "paragraph": "A spring is a mechanical element that utilizes the property of elasticity of an object: when the force is applied, it deforms and when the force is removed, it returns to its original state. In a broad sense, it can be said that it is a generic term for the main purpose of using elasticity. The English name is spring, and it is often referred to in Japanese as spring. It is also called Hatsujo. The springs are used in a wide variety of shapes and materials, ranging from daily necessities to vehicles, electronic devices, and structures. Coil springs are well known among the types of springs, especially compression coil springs. Others include board springs, spiral springs, torsion bars, and dish springs. Metal, especially steel, is widely used in spring materials, but non-metallic materials such as rubber, plastic, and ceramics are also used depending on the application. There are also air springs that produce the restorative power of air. The relation between the load of the spring and the deflection exists from the linear one in which the load is proportional to the deflection, to the nonlinear one in which the deflection is not proportional. The springs are used for a variety of purposes, such as showing the load as if it were only a spring, mitigating vibrations and impacts like an automobile suspension device, and storing and releasing elastic energy like a toy. The history of the use of springs in mankind dates back to ancient times, and bows that have been used since the primitive period are springs themselves. The springs were used in a variety of machines and instruments, including catapults, crossbows, mechanical watches, and horse-drawn hoisting equipment. In 1678, Robert Hook published Hook's Law, a very important physical law in springs. After the Industrial Revolution, springs developed as well as other industries, and theoretical design methods were established. Today, the production of springs is mainly machined and mass-produced, while for special springs, manual production is also carried out. The current demand for springs is diversifying, and advanced technology is also required to realize it. The object has a property called elasticity, which tries to return to its original state even if the force is applied and deformed. The broad definition of springs can be said to be a generic term for the use of this property of elasticity.",

He gave the boy a key to the car \"as a chip\" and gave him a car. Therefore, he had a large debt including a huge debt that was deceived by an acquaintance, and in 1966, he went bankrupt because he had a debt of 180 million yen at that time. Shochiku and Shochiku Entertainment announced the cancellation of the exclusive management contract. Kanmi, who was effectively dismissed from Shochiku, did not appear on the stage, and he lived his life by relying on Shigeru OKADA (later the president), who was the managing director of Toei, to appear in Toei's films. When he learned that Kanmi was bankrupt and was fired by Shochiku Shinkigeki, he asked Kanmi, 'Aho! Make a debt!' In effect, Kanmi was treated as a 'disarmament' at that point, but after his return, he was disarmed. Kanmi, who was able to take care of his junior geisha, often changed their debts, especially while he was still having a large amount of debts, and tried to change his debts by cashing 10 million yen on the eight sides of the moon, but he refused to say that he was afraid of them.

At the time of the removal, the new left wing sometimes prepared and resisted 2,000 flame bottles, and the Japanese government responded by introducing police riot squadrons, water dischargers, and heavy equipment. As of 2019, there are two unacquired huts in the airport grounds and two in the security grounds. In addition, the 'unification road' (unification road) called 'unification' (unification road) which is also called 'unification' (unification road) is not a common place shared by uprisings, but a common place called 'unification road' (unification road) by the Confederation of Airports of the Sanrizuka Shibayama Union (the Confederation). It existed in Shindenji Yokoyama, Kazan, Shibayama-cho. Construction began in December 1977. The land was built by the opposition alliance, which opposed the field of a man's father who committed suicide because of the Narita Airport problem. It has three floors above ground level on the first basement floor, complete with a bathtub, toilet and bed, and has a structure that can withstand long-term battles. On February 6, 1978, as a violation of Article 49 of the Aviation Act, the riot squad began to remove the 'Yokobori Fortress' and the iron tower built on it (the first 'Yokobori Fortress' incident). On March 25, the opposition alliance built 'Yokobori Fortress Iron Pagoda' again. On March 28, 'Yokobori Fortress Iron Pagoda' was removed as a violation of the aviation law (the second 'Yokobori Fortress' incident). The Narita Airport Control Tower Acquisition on March 26 was carried out due to the lack of security at the airport by the police. In February 1979, an order was issued for 'Yokobori Fortress' to prohibit the use of workpieces under Article 3(1), item (i) of the Narita New Law, and since then it has been updated every year. After that, he held a trial (the Narita New Law Incident) asking for the cancellation of the order to ban use and compensation for damages. In November 2002, former opposition farmers of landowners voluntarily removed the land after selling it to the New Tokyo International Airport Public Corporation. It was the first united hut in the Battle of Misatozuka built in December 1966 at Tenjin-mine (owned by the vice chairman of the opposition alliance) on the west side of Narita International Airport B runway. The site was 42-3 Tenjinhoji Minamidai, Narita City, Chiba Prefecture, with an area of about 113 square meters. Originally a meeting was held at the private residence of the opposition allies, but the struggle began to become full-fledged and the headquarters were built.",

In the event of a labor dispute or social movement, the supporters set up tents on the ground to support the struggle. However, in the case of prolonged fighting, a semi-permanent fighting base was required, rather than a temporary base such as a tent. This is the 'united hut.' The hut is provided by renting a private house close to the site or building a prefabricated hut directly on the site. There are many names such as '\u25cb\u25cb Local Fighting Headquarters.' In addition to the role of \"commander-in-chief\" in the struggle, the hut also has the function of accommodation where activists can stay in bed at all times. It is also used as a place of propaganda to convey the significance of this struggle to outsiders. If the hut is the land subject to the acquisition of the land, it may be countered as a common land of uprisings. In that case, it is necessary to carry out negotiations and execution of administrative representatives in order to acquire. If the hut remains even if the land is acquired, it is necessary to carry out the extradition and the demolition of the building in the case of trial. In the Narita Airport problem, a new left wing to support the Battle of Misatozuka established many huts near the planned location of Narita Airport. A characteristic of these huts was the appearance of iron towers in order to interfere with the take-off and landing of airplanes, and the structure was like a fence in a castle. Some of them were equipped with a 20-meter-high steel tower and had a four-story floor. Some buildings were built by reusing public buildings and vacant houses and collecting old materials. In 1971, he eliminated the huts established in the first and second keepers' executions. In 1977, just before the opening of the port, nearly 20 New Leftist factions established more than 30 permanent bases and had about 110 resident activists. In 1978, in order to regulate these huts, the Japanese government passed the new Emergency Measures Act on the Safety of New Tokyo International Airport (the Narita New Law, the current Emergency Measures Act on the Safety of Narita International Airport).

Although it is often written as 'Martin 202,' it is officially written as 'Martin 2-0-2.' It was developed with the intention of replacing Douglas DC-3. For this reason, the aircraft is slightly larger than the DC-3, and the engine is equipped with a significantly stronger class to improve cruise speed and payload. It first flew in November 1946, and was certified as a civilian aircraft in August 1947. However, due to structural design problems, production was discontinued due to pre-orders in mid-1948. Martin developed an advanced version with pressurized rooms, announced as the Martin 4-0-4 model, and moved to production. As a result, only 34 Martin-2-0-2s were produced. It was also a commercial failure, such as being resold early from the airlines that introduced it, or being canceled by Eastern Airlines, which had been ordered. In the late 1940s, after the end of World War II, many of the C-47 Skytrains and their variants produced in the military transport version of the DC-3 were dispensed to the private sector by thousands of surplus aircraft at the end of World War II, and were converted to the civilian DC-3 specifications, which were becoming widespread around the world. At the time when DC-3, which was somewhat outdated but low in operating costs and reliable, was easy to obtain for a low price, the development of a class that competed directly as \"post-DC-3\" was premature, and the low reliability of 2-0-2 itself could be said to have stumbled against the plot. In Japan, it was the first aircraft to be operated by Japan Airlines after World War II. On 29 August 1948, due to the insufficient strength of the main wing structure, the aircraft was disassembled and crashed while flying over Minnesota. The remaining aircraft was ordered by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to be refurbished, and only 34 aircraft were built. Even after countermeasures were carried out, reliability remained a questionable aircraft.",

Christian IV intervened in the German Thirty Years' War in 1626 and was defeated, leading to the decline of Denmark.

In October 1971, he abandoned the national isolation policy and joined the United Nations. In 1980, he formed alliances with the West, including a defense agreement with the United States, and, unlike other Arab countries, maintained good relations with Iran, thus acting as an intermediary between the United States and Iran. He was involved in the establishment of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), and joined at the time of its establishment on May 25, 1981. He advocated the establishment of a joint GCC force based on his experience in the Gulf War, and tried to strengthen his relationship with Saudi Arabia. On January 17, 2011, citizens affected by the Arab Spring in Muscat carried out anti-government demonstrations to criticize and improve government officials' corruption, and similar demonstrations occurred frequently in various parts of the country, resulting in conflicts with police. In response, Carbooth decided on policies such as creating employment, providing unemployment benefits, increasing social security costs, and increasing payroll, pension, and retirement for public servants, as well as carrying out major political reforms. He dismissed 20 ministers, including the Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry, the Minister of the Imperial Household, the Secretary of the Royal Household, and the Secretary of the Royal Police, who had supported him as aides to the throne. In addition to granting legislative and administrative audit rights to Congress, which had previously been just an advisory body, the abolition of the Ministry of National Economy, the establishment of the Ministry of Finance and Consumer Affairs, the independence of the prosecutor's office, and the establishment of local parliaments, national universities and Islamic banks were decided, and after that the anti-government demonstration was calmed down. Hiroshi Matsumoto described these decisions as 'a generational change of the central government using anti-government demonstrations' and 'a division of duties necessary for normal state management.'

After graduating from Yamaguchi Prefectural Otsu Junior High School (now Yamaguchi Prefectural Otsu Green and Western High School), he went to Kawabata Art School and entered Tokyo Art School in 1931, where he studied in the classroom of Takeji Fujishima. In 1936, after graduating from the art school, he became a teacher of the art department of Hokkaido Prefectural Chian Junior High School (now Chian Senior High School, Hokkaido). After that, he was transferred to Yamaguchi Prefectural Shimonoseki Higher Girls' School (present-day Yamaguchi Prefectural Shimonoseki South High School). In 1942, he was summoned to Manchuria by the outbreak of the Pacific War and went to Manchuria as a soldier. In 1945, he was detained by the Soviet Union and engaged in forced labor at the Saya camp in the Siberia and Krasnoyarsk districts.

In the Eastern Roman Empire, which was originally predominantly Greek, the official language was converted to Greek in the 7th century. In today's Western Europe, it became the official language of the Roman Catholic Church after the fall of the Roman Empire, and maintained its position as a literary language for a long time. The official language of the Vatican City is Latin. For example, the ceremony was held in Latin until the Second Vatican Council. To date, many composers have written songs in liturgical texts, and are one of the major singing languages in classical music. However, the actual use is limited to public documents and masses, and it is not mentioned on a daily basis. Also, the Latin used in the Vatican is a perverted Latin that is different from the classical formula. In Switzerland, a multi-ethnic and multi-lingual country, the acronym for the Latin name Confoederatio Helvetia is abbreviated (CH). Latin is also used in common terms in Europe, such as the European Company (Societas Europaea, SE). In the Middle Ages, many official documents and academic works were written in Latin (Medieval Latin, Church Latin), and this practice remains today. For example, the scientific name of the organism is a rule that uses Latin, and the name of the element is mostly Latin. There are also many Roman legislative and legal terms in law. Until the 19th century, universities in Europe were required to write dissertations in Latin. Today's Romance languages (East Romance: Italian, Romanian, West Romance: French, Spanish, Portuguese, etc.) are languages derived from Latin. It also greatly influenced Germanic languages such as English, German and Dutch in terms of grammar and vocabulary. In modern medicine, the anatomy term is basically Latin. This is related to the historical background in which the anatomy vocabulary, which was once freely coined and used by everyone, has been unified in BNA (Basel Anatomy Term) and PNA (Paris Anatomy Term).",

As the authority of the Muromachi bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) declined due to the instability of society, Sengoku daimyo (Japanese territorial lord in the Sengoku period) emerged all over the country in place of Shugo daimyo. In addition to increasing the tendency to control the land and people in the territory at once (uniform control), they began to engage in battles with other daimyo (Japanese feudal lords) in order to expand their territory. Such a strong control system by Sengoku daimyo (Japanese territorial lord in the Sengoku period) was called the daimyo's territorial system. According to the article of 'I should take care of the shugo (provincial constable) of each province,' written by Kaneyoshi ICHIJO in 1480, 'the kokushi (provincial governor) of each province was only one and four years old, and even though the shugo (provincial constable) at that time was the same as the old kokushi (provincial constable), it did not become the twelve lords in the spring and autumn and the seven males in the Sengoku period.'

Mangerno placed Anastasia as his vice-boss, but was seen as a political feat due to his friendship with Luciano. He became vice-president of the Italian-Jewish assassination and execution agency, Murder Ink, and was involved in a number of executions. In 1935, when his opinion broke on the Mafia Hunting Prosecutor Thomas Dewey's response, he agreed to the assassination and followed Dewey to verify the assassination. Although the assassination was reported to be feasible, the assassination of Dewey was not carried out. In 1941, former Murder Ink whistleblower Ave Rells, who was supposed to testify to Anastasia's past murders, fell from the sixth floor of the hotel and died on the morning of the testimony, freeing him from prosecution. The police treated him as a suicide. In 1942, he joined the U.S. Army to escape the investigation and served as an educational officer in Pennsylvania. The following year, he was recognized for his achievements in the field of education, and after reviewing documents that concealed his past criminal history, he obtained citizenship during the recruiting period. In December 1946, he attended the Cuban Havana Conference, where gangsters from the United States gathered (the Mangano brothers were absent). The relationship with the Luciano family was strong, and it gradually became inconsistent with his boss, Mangano. In April 1951, his boss, Vincent Mangano, was missing, and his younger brother, Philip Mangano, was found dead in a swamp in Seapshead. Anastasia confessed that Mangano was trying to kill herself, but denied the murder. There was no doubt that Anastasia had killed him, but he was officially confirmed to be his boss. As one of the five major family bosses, Tommy Galiano, died of a disease in February of the same year, it is believed that only three of the five major family bosses were temporarily killed at the time of Mangano's disappearance. Costello was believed to have agreed to kill Anastasia's cruel boss in advance, and Bonanno was uninterventional and Profati was the only one who opposed Anastasia's position as boss. Costello's approval of Mangano's murder was said to be to strengthen his allies against rival Genovese. Anastasia appointed the family's senior executive, Frank Scullyche, as its vice-president.",

His real name is Umberto Anastasio. Together with Lucky Luciano, Frank Costello, and Joe Adnis, he built the golden age of the New York Mafia. He was born in Tropea, Calabria, one of nine brothers. He emigrated to the United States in 1917 and settled in Brooklyn, New York. Two of his younger brothers entered the country lately. Shortly after he moved to Brooklyn, he became a cargo worker. In 1920, he quarreled with a colleague at the quay named Joe Turin over the ship's unloading, stabbed with a knife and strangled his neck to kill him. The following year, he was arrested and sentenced to death and sent to Singh Singh Prison. He spent his days waiting for the death penalty in his cell, but two years later, in a retrial, a witness gave testimony and disappeared, so his death penalty was withdrawn and he was acquitted. In the early 1920s, he was a member of the gang of Calabrian Viaggio Giordano, and developed into a bloodshed over the smuggling of alcohol with the Palermo mafia Josef Bussardo. He was arrested by the police for murdering the Bussards. In April 1923, he was snipered by an enemy who was ambushed while driving a car, and was seriously injured (his passenger, Giordano, died). Shortly thereafter, Frankie Yale's son Vincent Mangano was intimidated, slid, and transported across the cargo to the workers. Following his brother Anthony's appointment as vice-president of the International Port Labor Union ILA, he formed a \"killer's team\" and took control of Brooklyn's wreckage by force. He borrowed money from both the port workers and the management under the name of the union. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, he fought against the Palermo-Joseph Profach forces over the territory of southern Brooklyn (later reconciled). He buried a gang of the same Calabrian rivals within the union and climbed to the top of the Mangano organization. In May 1929, he participated in the Atlantic Conference, a grand rally of gangs across the United States, with Mangerno and others. Mangerno was replaced by Joe Masseria and became friends with Lucky Luciano, the head of the Masseria family. He also met Frank Costello and others. According to legend, in April 1931, he and Vito Genovese, Joe Adnis and Benjamin Sigel shot and killed Masseria at an Italian restaurant in Coney Island.",

Massachusetts' predecessor, the Massachusetts Bay Colony, is named after the Massachusetts tribe, an Indian tribe that once lived around the Massachusetts Bay. The tribe's name is Masatuset, which means \"the place of a large hill\" and refers to a small mountain (today's \"Blue Hills\") between Milton and Canton, south of Boston. It is spelled mass-adchu-s-et, mass- is \"large\", -adchu- is \"oka\", -s- is \"small\", and -et is a place.

The name Scots comes from the Scotts who united the area. In Scottish Gaelic, it is called Alba. In Latin it is called \"Caledonia\". As for the origin of the word, Scott is said to be derived from the Old Irish word \"Scoti\", meaning \"desolate\", and the names \"Alba\" and \"Caredonia\" derive from the name of the ancient Clan.

The north (Highland) is a mountainous area close to northern Europe, with glaciated hills and fjords in the land. The highest peak, Mount Bennevis (1344 m above sea level), is located at the western end of the Grand Pian Mountains. There is also Lake Ness, the largest freshwater lake in Great Britain. Geologically, it consisted of pre-Cambrian and Cambrian rocks, which were raised by the Caledonian mountain-building movement. The exception is the Devonian red sandstone, which is predominantly distributed on the Gulf of Murray and the Gulf of Force. Rowland, on the other hand, produced coal and iron ore, which were important for the industrial revolution, in a valley made up of Paleozoic rocks. Volcanoes were also active. In the south (Upland) is a sloppy hilly area formed by the weathering of Silurian rocks, which is close to the English topography. There is a great fault that extends south-west from Murray Bay and Aberdeen in the Grand Pian Mountains (right figure), and is called the Great Glen Fault in the north and the Highland Boundary Fault in the south.

There are more than 790 islands in Scotland, mostly in the Northern Islands and the Hebrides. Scotland (the Kingdom of Scotland) was born as an independent sovereign state in the early Middle Ages of Europe and lasted until 1707. In 1603, King James VI of Scotland became kings of England and Ireland, forming the confederation of the three kingdoms. Scotland then formed a political alliance with the Kingdom of England on 1 May 1707, establishing a new Kingdom of Great Britain. This consolidation also led to the establishment of the Great Britain Legislature, which followed the Scottish Parliament and the English Parliament. In 1801, the Kingdom of Great Britain formed a political alliance with the Kingdom of Ireland to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (in 1922, the Free State of Ireland withdrew from the United Kingdom and officially changed its name to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in 1927). Within Scotland, the British monarchy continued to use various styles, titles, and other royal symbols specific to the pre-Unification Kingdom of Scotland. Scotland's legal system is also independent of English, Welsh, and Northern Ireland's legal system, and Scotland has separate jurisdictions in both public and private law. The continued existence of laws, education, religion, and other institutions in different forms than the rest of the United Kingdom has contributed to the continuation of Scottish culture and nationality since its integration with England in 1707. In 1999, the Scottish Parliament was re-established in the form of a single legislature consisting of 129 members, and has authority in many areas of national policy. The Scottish government is headed by the Scottish Prime Minister and supported by the Scottish Vice Prime Minister. Scotland has 59 members of Parliament.

It is now a common form in the Slavic Orthodox Church, but not in the Greek Orthodox Church. This is due to the fact that the Slavic Orthodox Church and the Greek Orthodox Church retained a different lineage of traditions based on their respective religious traditions (although there used to be a period of Greek Orthodox Church in the Middle Ages, it soon became obsolete). It is held on the eve of the main day (Sunday) (Saturday evening) and on the eve of the festival day. The Orthodox Church of Japan inherits the tradition of the Slavic tradition and conducts all-night twilight. The origin of the word 'panihida,' which is a ritual for eternal sleepers, is 'the prayer of the whole night,' and there are many cases where it is mistakenly called 'Tetsuya-toge Pass,' but in the Orthodox Church, Panihida is not called 'Tatsuya-toge Pass.' Although it is called 'Tetsuya-toge Pass,' it is not actually held all night in a church outside the monastery (a church attended by ordinary believers). Depending on how much time it takes to omit, it is common for a church in the city to take an hour and a half to three and a half hours, usually starting at 17 or 18 o'clock, and often ending around 20 o'clock. In some cases, it takes about six hours to complete a full night's chopsticks without omitting the chopsticks. All-night rites are positioned as rites to prepare holy rites. In Slavic monasteries, it is held on the eve of the main day (Sunday) and the grand festival, and it is not carried out on a daily basis. However, in the church of the city, shintai-reigi is performed only on the main day and the major festivals (such as the twelve major festivals), so as a result, it is common that zenyabira is performed more frequently throughout the year than ordinary supper.

It is often written as sultan in accordance with the pronunciations of Malay and Turkish, and is also translated as 'King' or 'Emperor.' In the past, it was also written as sultan by transliteration of pronunciation in English, but it is rare in recent years. The term Sultan was used in the Quran to mean \"the authority derived from God\" and was adopted as the title of monarch for the first time in the Abbasid caliphate. As a patron of the Abbasid Caliphate in the 11th century, Seljuk Tugary Beg was awarded the title Sultan by Caliph, and was used as an emperor against the pope in Western Europe. After the decline of the Seljuk dynasty, it was adopted as the title of monarch in the Islamic dynasty, which was independent of the Seljuk dynasty, such as the Room Seljuk and Horasm Shah, and became a common title in the Sunnaist Islamic world. Since then, the Iyubes, Mamluks and other dynasties have called themselves Sultan's monarchs under the approval of the Abbasid Caliphate, and used them for their authority, but they do not necessarily require the appointment of Caliphs, as the emperors of the Holy Roman Empire, often compared, were crowned to Rome. In the Ottoman period, the first name of Sultan was Orhan, the second, and he called himself \"Sultan Slayman Shah Han\" in combination with the titles of Shah and Han. Later, when the Ottoman Empire developed, the title of Purdyshire became common, but the term \"Sultan\" came to be used in front of the monarchy, the term \"Sultan of the Sultan\", and the title \"Sultan\" was also used as the title of the prince's empress or daughter. In the 19th century, when the claim of the \"Sultan-Calyph system\" emerged, the monarchs of the Ottoman Empire were considered to combine the secular power of Sultan and the religious authority of Calyph. The monarchs of Oman, Brunei, and Malaysia now use the title Sultan. Indonesia has been a republic since its founding, but for special reasons only sultan has existed in the special province of Jogyakarta, and sultan has been granted the status of sultan. The Jogyakarta Special State was once the hereditary and lifetime governor of Sultan, but after the collapse of the old system, the governor was elected, and although the hereditary governor system was nominally abolished, Sultan (Hamenkbuwano 10) was elected as the governor of Sultan.",

        "paragraph": "The three characteristics that a spring has, or is required by a spring, are roughly divided into three characteristics, which are also referred to as the \"three major characteristics of a spring\". In addition to the parts and objects called springs, these three characteristics are provided, but it can be said that springs use these characteristics particularly well. There are other basic properties of springs and different ways of working, but note 1), along with these three main categories, we will explain the basic characteristics of springs. The spring has the property that when applied, it deforms, and when removed, it returns to its original form. Having the property of trying to return to the original even if the force is formed and deformed in this way is the basic property of the spring, and is a necessary condition. The power to return to its original form is called \"restore power\", and the presence of restore power is one of the main characteristics of springs. The restoration force is due to the property of \"elasticity\" of the substance, and the deformation that returns to the original shape when the force is removed is called \"elastic deformation\". However, when the force (to be precise, stress) is applied beyond the limit of the material, the deformation (to be precise, strain) remains even if the force is excluded. This property is called \"plasticity\", and the deformation that does not return due to the nature of plasticity is called \"plastic deformation\". The maximum stress at which the deformation stays in the elastic deformation is called the \"elastic limit\". Since springs are used on the assumption that they return to their original state, plastic deformation is not desirable, and they are generally used to the extent that the force applied to the spring does not exceed the elastic limit. The deformation of springs and the amount of deformation are called 'wami.' There are two types of physical units of deflection: displacement (change in length) and rotational angle (change in twisting and bending angles). In compression coil springs that make use of the change in length, the units of deflection are represented by displacement. In the torsion bar where the torsion angle of the rod is changed, the unit of deflection is a rotation angle (torsion angle). Depending on the physical quantity of the deflection, there are several types of loads that cause the deflection. If it is displaced, it is a load (pure force), and if it is a torsion angle, a torsion moment can be considered.",

        "paragraph": "A spring is a mechanical element that utilizes the property of elasticity of an object: when the force is applied, it deforms and when the force is removed, it returns to its original state. In a broad sense, it can be said that it is a generic term for the main purpose of using elasticity. The English name is spring, and it is often referred to in Japanese as spring. It is also called Hatsujo. The springs are used in a wide variety of shapes and materials, ranging from daily necessities to vehicles, electronic devices, and structures. Coil springs are well known among the types of springs, especially compression coil springs. Others include board springs, spiral springs, torsion bars, and dish springs. Metal, especially steel, is widely used in spring materials, but non-metallic materials such as rubber, plastic, and ceramics are also used depending on the application. There are also air springs that produce the restorative power of air. The relation between the load of the spring and the deflection exists from the linear one in which the load is proportional to the deflection, to the nonlinear one in which the deflection is not proportional. The springs are used for a variety of purposes, such as showing the load as if it were only a spring, mitigating vibrations and impacts like an automobile suspension device, and storing and releasing elastic energy like a toy. The history of the use of springs in mankind dates back to ancient times, and bows that have been used since the primitive period are springs themselves. The springs were used in a variety of machines and instruments, including catapults, crossbows, mechanical watches, and horse-drawn hoisting equipment. In 1678, Robert Hook published Hook's Law, a very important physical law in springs. After the Industrial Revolution, springs developed as well as other industries, and theoretical design methods were established. Today, the production of springs is mainly machined and mass-produced, while for special springs, manual production is also carried out. The current demand for springs is diversifying, and advanced technology is also required to realize it. The object has a property called elasticity, which tries to return to its original state even if the force is applied and deformed. The broad definition of springs can be said to be a generic term for the use of this property of elasticity.",

Miyoshi, in his book 'Natural Monuments,' published in 1915, defines natural monuments as 'something that has existed in the land since ancient times and remains in the land, or is almost unaffected by mankind, i.e., natural forests, natural fields, or unique geology, rocks, animals, etc.' In 1911, the 'Constitution Plan for the Preservation of Natural Monuments of Historic Places and Scenic Scenic Beauty' was submitted to the House of Peers, and in 1919, the 'Act on the Preservation of Natural Monuments of Scenic Scenic Scenic Scenic Scenic Scenicism' was enacted, and the protection of natural monuments in Japan began. In 1950, the law was abolished and succeeded to the Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties. In 1933, the protection system of natural monuments was established in the Korean Peninsula and Taiwan, which were under Japanese control, and they were handed over to Korea, North Korea, and Taiwan after their liberation. When simply referred to as a \"natural monument\" in Japan, it usually refers to natural monuments designated by the country. Natural monuments designated by the government are designated by the Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology based on the Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties (established in 1950). Section 2 of the Cultural Properties Division of the Agency for Cultural Affairs 2] The precursor to the Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties was the 'Historical Law for the Preservation of Natural Chronicles of Japan' promulgated in 1919. The position of natural monuments is one of the three subdivisions of 'monuments' among the six kinds of 'cultural properties' prescribed in Article 2 of the Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties (the other two are 'historical sites' and 'blessings'). The four designated areas are animals, plants, geological minerals, and \"a representative constant area rich in protected natural monuments\" (natural protected areas). It is also possible to specify habitats, breeding areas, and habitats for animals, self-fabrics for plants, and \"lands with unique natural phenomena\" for minerals.",

In addition, the length of the day has increased by 1.7 milliseconds in 100 years (according to tidal acceleration) and the number of days per year is shortened by about 0.001 days per 1000 years. This means that in a long period of time, the modified Julian calendar will no longer be accurate, even if it is based on the mean solar time. The Julian calendar, the Gregorian calendar, and the modified Julian calendar all have the following characteristics. Therefore, the date (date) may match. If the occultation method in the modified Julius calendar was applied before its introduction date (the first revised Julius calendar), the date would match the Julius calendar only from March 1, 300 to February 28, 400. As of 1923, the Gregorian calendar coincided with the Gregorian calendar for the time being.

Kamyo was a busho (Japanese military commander) who served Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI and was counted as one of the Shichihonbuchi of Mt. Sagagatake. At that time, Shigetsuna MATSUSHITA, who was Yoshiaki's daughter-in-law, added 28,000 koku to the Shimotsuke Karashiroyama Domain and joined Nihonmatsu with 50,000 koku, so the Nihonmatsu Domain was established. Shigetsuna was the son of Yukitsuna, who had a time when Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI served as his lord when he was young. The Matsushita territory controlled 18 villages in Higashi-Adachi County and 28 villages in Nishi-Adachi County. However, Shigetsuna died of illness in October of the same year, and his legitimate son Nagatsuna succeeded to the family, but the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) transferred to the Miharu Domain in Mutsu Province with 30,000 koku crop yielding 20,000 koku in January 1628 because of Nagatsuna's childhood. Akitoshi KATO, the third son of Yoshiaki, joined Nihonmatsu instead of Nagatsuna. When his father joined Aizu the previous year, Akitoshi was given 30,000 koku of the Miharu Domain. However, when Yoshiakira died in September 1631 and his legitimate son, Akinari succeeded him, Shinden-kenchi was carried out severely in the Kato territory, both Aizu and Nihonmatsu. This was because Shikoku, which was a climate-friendly and advanced agricultural zone, had been replaced by Aizu and Nihonmatsu, which were cold successors, and because they increased by more than twice, they were responsible for the military service and fushin of the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) corresponding to them, and financial difficulties became serious. For this reason, while the Kato family promoted the development of Nitta, they increased their nengu (land tax) and the people of Nihonmatsu suffered from tyranny of the Kato family. For this reason, when Iemitsu TOKUGAWA dispatched the Ou-Matsumae Junkenshi, he even tried to submit a complaint to the Kankenshi appealing to the Kansei of the Kato family in the Utatsu region (\"Kojiki\" (Chronicles of Japan)). However, the Kato family interfered and submitted a complaint failed, and after a visit, they were searched severely, and the masterminds were picked up and executed in 1635. In the Nihonmatsu territory, taxation other than nengu (land tax) (Komotsunari) was severely increased, but in addition to the repair of Aizu-Wakamatsu-jo Castle and the construction of Edo-jo Castle Fushin, the burden of labor by the state was heavy, and the people of the domain sold themselves and escaped one after another.",

Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI, who surrendered Ujinao HOJO in the conquest of Odawara in July 1590, entered Aizu in August, and Nihonmatsu became the territory of Ujisato GAMO, who became the lord of Aizu, due to the Oshu-tei and the Oshu-tei-tei-tei. Ujisato was a daughter-in-law of Nobunaga ODA and had a territory in Ise before that. During the Mibu period, the land survey was carried out at the order of Hideyoshi during the Tensho and Bunroku eras, and the territory of Mibu was estimated to be 919320 koku. Ujisato died suddenly in February 1595, and his legitimate son Hideyuki GAMO succeeded to the castle, but Hideyoshi ordered that most of the castles in the territory except Aizu-Kurokawa, Shirakawa and Nihonmatsu be destroyed by Nagamasa ASANO and Yukinaga. Hideyuki married Kashiwahime, the third daughter of Ieyasu, but in January 1598, he was reduced and transferred to Shimotsuke Utsunomiya with 180,000 koku.

Kagekatsu enclosed Yoshimoto YASUDA, Tadachika SHIMOJO, Sadatsuna AKIYAMA, Kagekuni YAMAURA, Fusatsuna ICHIKAWA, and others in a branch castle in the Shitate region with two pine trees. After Hideyoshi died, the Battle of Sekigahara broke out in 1600, and when the Western army was defeated, Kagekatsu lost 900,000 koku by Ieyasu TOKUGAWA in August 1601 and was transferred to 300,000 koku of Dewa Yonezawa Domain, and Hideyuki GAMO who had moved from Aizu to Utsunomiya was added to 600,000 koku, and Nihonmatsu came under his control. In the era of Hideyuki, there were a number of peasants' escapes due to the increase of nengu (land tax) and the heavy burden of various roles, in addition to the occurrence of sakusaku, famine, great earthquakes and flood damage. Hideyuki died at the age of 30 in May 1612, and his legitimate son Tadasato succeeded him, but there was also Naiju in the family, which continued from the previous generation, and when Tadasato died young in January 1627, the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) abolished Aizu's territory of 600,000 koku because Tadasato had no heir (however, the territory remained in Iyo).",

In 1386, his father, Baglat, was defeated by Timur and captured. Prince Giorgi retaliated against the subsequent invasion and released his father, Baghrat. After his father's death in 1393, Giorgi took over the throne. Giorgi spent most of his reign fighting Timur. From 1387 to 1403, the Timur dynasty made seven more invasions of the resisting Kingdom of Georgia. Timur's main goal was to conquer Georgia and convert its people to Islam. Giorgi evacuated the inhabitants of the war to the mountains and continued to resist Timur's devastating attack. Timur personally directed most of his invasions to suppress Georgia, which continued to take rebellious action. Timur was unable to take control of Georgia, but gave Georgia a hard-to-recover blow. Despite Timur's cruel attacks, the Georgians resisted fiercely, and Timur was unable to capture Giorgi. Eventually, in 1403, Giorgi recognized Timur as the head of the sect and made peace. Giorgi retained the right to be crowned as the monarch of the Christian State. After the war with Timur, the Great Army of the Black Lambs approached the southeastern border of the Kingdom of Georgia. In 1407, Giorgi was in contact with Turkmen's troops in the Armenian region. Giorgi fought to prevent the invasion of the new enemy in Georgia, which was devastated and weakened. According to the 18th-century historian Vaf City Baglationi, Giorgi was killed in the Battle of Nahiduri. This record is debated today, and there is a theory that Giorgi died naturally.

Naoshige approached the Tokugawa family from early on, and since he devoted himself to Hidetada TOKUGAWA, he asked for treatment equivalent to fudai daimyo (daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family) even though he was a tozama daimyo (Japanese feudal lord). At first, the domain was established with 12,000 koku, but the Suzaka Domain became 10,000 koku because Naosuke HORI, the second head of the domain, divided 11,000 koku of 2,000 koku crop yields produced by Yahagi in Shimousa Province into his second younger brother, Naoaki HORI, and 500 koku crop yields for his three younger brothers and his youngest younger brother, respectively.

President Dwight Eisenhower's Christmas message was sent by a tape recorder in orbit in a short wave, attracting attention all over the world. A six-month review of the newly formed Higher Research Planning Bureau, headed by Roy Johnson, concluded that a small, highly focused and flexible research group with sufficient resources would be the best organization to achieve the technological advances needed to win the international space race. SCORE had two technical objectives. In addition to demonstrating that Atlas missiles can reach orbit, the plan also showed the possibility of transmitting information from one ground base station to one or more ground base stations via the upper atmosphere. The plan resulted in a breakthrough in both real-time and store-and-forward communication satellites that could transmit information from one point on the ground to another. SCORE Communications was developed by military communications researcher Kenneth Masterman-Smith with colleagues from the Signal Research and Development Laboratory (SRDL) of the United States Army. The entire project was carried out secretly, knowing only 88 people. Before the launch date of the SCORE, 53 out of 88 people were told that the project had been cancelled and were ordered not to exaggerate the existence of the plan.

However, as Germany became militaristic as a German policy, and Hitler Yougent became more and more colourful as a semi-military organization before joining the army, as it was forced to join Hitler Yougent, even young people who did not participate in it were taken in from the antipathy of Yugent. In addition, Hitler Yougent patrolled the town and cracked down on the frenzy, which was monitored by the same age, and originally raised the resentment of rebellious adolescents. Thus, the complete organization of the youth by the Nazis was only a precursor to the actions of young men who were rebellious against Hitler Youth. In addition, as the war progressed, most of Hitler Youth's leisure activities and travels ceased, until they were canceled. Instead, military training of absolute obedience was compulsory due to the semi-military organization, but with this training, it became difficult for them to withstand the orders of the middle and high school students who had no relationship with the rebellious youths, who were mainly children of the working class.",

The battlefield spans modern Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Kazakhstan, with battles taking place from the southwestern part of ancient Tashkent (Uzbekistan) to the northeastern part of Hogend (Tajikistan). During the Eastern Expedition, Alexander decided in advance to incorporate the Yakusartes into the new borders of the northeastern part of his empire. The Macedonian army began to build new cities to establish boundaries, while the local Sogdianas rebelled. While the Macedonian army was suppressing the revolt during a fierce battle, a cavalry of nomadic warriors appeared in the northern part of the Yaksartes River to participate in the battle and bring back their war boots. In 339 BC, Scythia suffered a tragic defeat in the battle against Philip II, the father of Alexander the Great, who killed Atheas, the king of Scythia. Thus, the attack on the Macedonian army had elements of revenge and revenge. The Scythians gathered on the other side of the Yaksartes and provoked the Macedonian army with allegiance. Alexander finally became angry and decided to attack the Scythian army on a provocation. When the Scythians landed on the north bank of the Yakusartes, they were expected to defeat Alexander the Great, but they underestimated the command of the Macedonian archers, fleets, cavalry, and infantry. Alexander the Great ordered a large crossing of the river to face more enemies than the enemy's horsemen could attack at once. He also used projectile weapons such as baristas and catapults to support his troops crossing the river. The Scythians were attacked from the other side by projectiles, causing confusion. As a result, it was easy for the Macedonians to cross the Yakusartes River. This so-called landing support attack tactic is the first recorded event. At the beginning of the battle, Scythian cavalry deployed a tactic to shoot arrows while drawing arcs around the Macedonian army, and withdraw when the Macedonian army tried to approach them.",

When Antiochus IV Epiphanes invaded Egypt in 170 BC, and captured Ptolemy VI Philometr and made him Syria's nephew, Alexander took Euerguetes as king, and the reign of Ptolemy VIII began. His older brother, Philometre, ruled the Delta south of Memphis, while his younger brother, Euergethes, seized Alexandria and took control of the Delta, and at the same time the two kings fought against Egypt. The Egyptians supported Euerguetes, but the Roman Senate followed Antiochus IV. However, Ptolemy VI tried to connect his brother with Rome to gain power, and Antiochus IV sent an army to Memphis and Alexandria to approach the capital. However, after the triumph of the Third Macedonian War, Caius Popilius Laenas was sent as an envoy from Rome, who had been able to afford the arbitration of both countries. Antiochus IV had no choice but to respond to the powerful intermediary of Rome, which no longer had any rivalry with the Mediterranean, and Egypt was appointed to Ptolemy VI after the Syrian soldiers were drawn, and Euerguetes also obtained Kilenica. Since then, however, Egypt has been directly influenced by Rome. Ptolemy VI held a stable government for nearly 30 years, but after his defeat and death in Syria in 145 BC, the mercenaries under his command flowed towards the winners, and Euergethes led the army back to Egypt with Cleopatra II and his son Ptolemy VII. He married Cleopatra II under the condition of guaranteeing his mother's and children's lives, and at the same time married Cleopatra III, his daughter. When the two children were born, they killed Ptolemy VII, the heir to the throne, and took control of Egypt with the help of Rome. However, Ptolemy VIII, who was married together with his mother and daughter and fell in popularity due to a series of wars and heavy taxes, was not supported by the public, and even riots occurred and Confucianism sometimes surrounded the palace.",

Before entering kindergarten, she was a child who always reads books everywhere, and she said to the nursery mother, \"I want to be a person who writes books.\" When he was in elementary school, he read Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes series and Maurice Leblanc's Arsene Lupin series, and when he was in junior high school, he almost finished reading the famous mysteries of Agatha Christie and Elaley Queen. In the mid-1970s, he watched the movie \"Inugamike no Kazoku\" (The Family of Inugami Family) and became involved in the Edogawa turbulent walk with Masashi YOKODUMA, and became aware of the Edogawa turbulent walk award and read the award-winning works.

Under Muslim rule, the church was under certain autonomy, but after a Muslim riot in 966, doors and roofs were burned. In addition, the Fatimaic caliph, Herkim, ordered the destruction of the Christian Church, and the church itself disappeared temporarily on 18 October 1009. However, under severe circumstances, the Eastern Roman Emperor Constantine IX, Monomachus, rebuilt a small church in 1048. The land was recaptured by the Knights of the First Crusade on 15 January 1099. The First Crusade viewed itself as an armed pilgrimage, and did not consider their expedition to be completed until they prayed as pilgrims at the Holy Graves Church. Crusade leader Godflois de Bouillon decided not to use the title \"king\" in his life and declared himself \"Advocatus Sancti Sepulchri\". The 12th-century chronologist Guillaume de Thiel wrote that the Crusades in the mid-12th century rebuilt the church in Romanesque style and added bell towers. Immediately after entering the church is a stone that is believed to be the place where Jesus Christ's body was prepared for burial. There is a stone tomb, which is said to have been resurrected three days after Jesus was buried in the central dome. The church is now co-managed by the Eastern Orthodox Church (Greek Orthodox), the Armenian Apostolic Church, the Catholic Church, the Copto Orthodox Church, and the Syrian Orthodox Church, and is held throughout the day in public prayers such as masses and saints by some sects. With regard to the administration of the Church of the Holy Tumulus and the prior use of it, each sect has a history of conflicting with the convictions of European countries. He died in 1846, just before the Crimean War, partly due to the issue of the administrative rights of the Holy Land Jerusalem. For this reason, two families of Muslims, including Mr. Nusebe, who are neutral to each Christian sect, are entrusted with the management of the key.

In the Orthodox and non-Calcedonian Orthodox Armenian Apostles, it is the bishopric church of the Armenian Patriarch of Jerusalem and the center of church administration in the Middle East. In about 325, Emperor Constantine I of Rome ordered the building of a church on the Golgotha Hill (The Gospel of Matthew 27:33, etc.) at the site of Christ's imprisonment. His remains were once buried by Josef and others in Arimathaya, and the tomb was supposed to have been resurrected on the third day (\"The Gospel by John 19:41-42\"). Jerusalem was destroyed by two Jewish wars and was redeveloped into a Roman-style city around 135. As a result, the location of Golgotha was not known. According to the sources, Helena, the mother of Constantine, visited Jerusalem in 326 and found the holy cross and holy relics used for abductions in the place, which was then the Temple of Venus, which he identified as Golgota. The church was built after the temple was demolished. A small church in the church is said to be the grave of Jesus. The site is in the Old Wall of Jerusalem, but there is doubt that the execution site was outside the Wall (\"Letters to the Hebrews 13:12\"). Apart from the Church of the Holy Tumulus, there is a \"Garden Tomb\" outside the walls of the castle, which is supported by some Orthodox and Protestant denominations. The Holy Tumulus Church was a church that connected three different sanctuaries related to Jesus Christ. This included basilica, atrium, and a rotanda called \"Anastasis\". The Lotanda dome was completed at the end of the 4th century. The church was damaged by fire in 614, when the Sassanid army under the rule of Hosrow II invaded Jerusalem and took over the Holy Cross.",

In 1652, the Dutch East India Company, Jan van Rebeck, arrived in the area, and was based on the Cape of Good Hope. It was noted as an important base for navigation, and the climate was relatively similar to that of Europe. Since then, the number of Dutch immigrants has increased and the Cape Colony has been established. In addition to the expansion of the Boers (also known as the Boers in Afrikaans) formed in the colony, there was also a conflict with the Pre-Africans, such as the Koi and San. On the other hand, a mixture of Native Africans, Boers, and Indonesians and Boers who had been brought as slaves from Dutch East India led to the birth of a ethnic group later known as Colored. By the end of the 18th century, the British had arrived at the mines of gold and diamonds. Boer and the British were opposed, and British General William Beresford occupied Cape Town in 1795 during the French Revolutionary War. After the end of the Napoleonic Wars, Cape Colony was officially transferred from the Netherlands to the United Kingdom in the early 19th century, with many British emigrants. The English language became the official language of the British colony, and the influence of the British increased with the introduction of the country's judicial system.

In 1919, Koji SHIBATA met Yanagi and Shiga when he visited the wand of this leech. In 1914, Hokkyo ASAGAWA, a pottery researcher, visited his grandchildren to see the sculptures of Rodin stored under Yanagi. At that time, Yanagi became interested in Korean ceramics because he was fascinated by the Yi Dynasty Autumn and Kusasa Monmen-tsuke-no-tsuke, which was given to Yanagi by Asakawa. After 1916, he visited the country many times and collected crafts. In 1921, Yanagi published the 'Plan for Establishment of the Korean National Museum' in the magazine Hakuho, and opened the Korean National Museum in Seoul's former royal palace, Kagefuku-gu Shrine in 1924. During this time, when the Japanese government planned the demolition of the Kokamon gate in 1922, Yanagi issued a sentence saying, 'For the sake of the Korean architecture that will not be lost' against the plan, and asked for the preservation of the building. As he travelled through Korea, Yanagi was deeply impressed by Richo's miscellaneous equipment and deepened his interest. At that time, Licho's ceramics were almost unrecognized for their aesthetic value, and Yanagi was one of the pioneers in finding their value. Then, this encounter with Yi Dynasty ceramics led to Yanagi's opinion of folklore later. On the other hand, in 1917, the magazine \"Shirakazura\" published 'Shirakazura Museum of Art' and called for the establishment of the Shirokazura Museum of Art. At that time, the same person in \"Hakuto\" mainly used prints through publication of magazines, absorbing the trends of Western art, and using reproductions to hold exhibitions. However, in 1911, when he made a special feature of Rodin in Hakuho, he sent a magazine to Rodin himself, along with Ukiyoe, and was presented with three bronze statues by Rodin. This led to a plan to establish a museum to display the real thing.

Exercise has been carried out at Minjokan (Minpo-kan) all over the country. Sorin YANAGI, the founder of the Museum of Japanese Folklore and a central figure in the Folklore movement, tried to discover and introduce the beauty of folk art and craftsmanship by unknown craftsmen, who were neither fine art in the Western sense nor expensive antiques, which had not been properly appreciated by the history of art in the Edo period, such as daily miscellaneousware made by unknown craftsmen such as yakimono, dyed textiles, lacquerware, and wood bamboo craftsmanship in various parts of Japan, art crafts from the Korean dynasty, and Buddhist statues of Mokujiki, a monk of the Edo period. Munehiro YANAGI, one of the proponents of 'Minpo,' was born in Azabu, Tokyo in 1889. In 1895, he entered the elementary school of Gakushuin and studied German at Kitaro NISHIDA and English at Daijo SUZUKI. While he was in school, he deepened his friendship with Sanesuke MUSHANOKOJI and Naosuke SHIGA, and in 1910 he started a magazine called \"Hakuto.\" In the previous year, he visited Bernard Leach, who was holding an etching class in Japan with his fellows who later became \"Hakuto.\" In 1910, Yanagi entered the Department of Philosophy, Tokyo Imperial University. Yanagi, who was interested in theology at the time, majored in psychology with an awareness of the question of whether science could contribute to solving the problem of old disease and death. Yanagi later fell in love with art, but at first he had a strong interest in science and philosophy, and contributed papers on theology to \"Hakuto.\" In 1913, Yanagi graduated from Tokyo Imperial University. In 1914, Yanagi married Kaneko NAKAJIMA and moved to Mt. Tenjin. Later, Naosuke SHIGA and Sanesuke MUSHAKOJI of the same person as \"Hakuto\" moved to my grandchildren, and a community of artists such as Yanagi called 'Colony' was born.",

Taishogetsu is also called Odoshi or Otoko no New Year, whereas Koshogetsu is called Kodoshi or Ojo no New Year. Since January 20 is the New Year's Day, January 20 is called 'Hatsukasho-gatsu.' In some regions, January 30 is called 'Miso-kashogatsu.' December 8th is called 'New Year's Day,' and preparations for New Year's Day begin. In regards to preparations for the New Year, December 13 was called 'Aoihaki' in the old calendar, but in fact, there were many regions where 'Aoihaki' was performed around December 27. January 1 is a national holiday named the New Year's Day. According to the provisions of Article 1, paragraph (1), item (iii) of the Act on the Holidays of Administrative Organs, the administrative organs have holidays from December 29 to January 3, and are often equivalent to those of general companies. Banks and other financial institutions often take holidays from December 31 to January 3 according to the provisions of Article 5, Paragraph 1, No. 2 of the Ordinance for Enforcement of Banking Law, and may become longer because of system maintenance. Public transportation tends to operate on holidays even on weekdays during this period. In the retail business, on the other hand, many shops were closed until around the first half of the 1980s, and even large shops such as department stores and supermarkets were closed on the third day of the new year until around 1980. However, due to changes in lifestyles, such as the advent of a 24-hour convenience store, the opening date became early, and many stores closed only on New Year's Day after the 1990s, and started to operate in a short period of time from the next 2 days. Some stores, such as large-scale stores, often operate on New Year's Day in spite of a short period of time. Since 2017, some major department stores and food and beverage chains have been looking to revise their day-to-day operations due to \"workstyle reform\" promoted by the country and chronic labor shortages in the retail industry.",

Culturally, it is an event to celebrate the end of the old year and the new year. It is decorated in New Year's decoration and celebrated by performing New Year's events and eating Osechi dishes. In Japan, only New Year's Day on January 1 is regarded as a national holiday, but \"New Year's Day\" at least 3 days is a practical holiday because work is often a holiday. In the old New Year, as in Obon, it was an event where the spirits of ancestors were summoned and commemorated. It gradually diverged and became a celebration of the new year and a wish for the year's healthlessness. Chinese \"New Year\" refers to the month of January in the lunar calendar. In ancient Rome, the year was 10 months, the first month of Martius and the new year of Kalendae Martiae. Around 713 BC, Ianuarius and Februarius were added by Numa Pompilius, and Kalendae Ianuariae became New Year's Day, but it was not used as a consul until 153 BC. In 45 BC, Gaius Julius Caesar introduced the Julian calendar, and Kalendae Ianuariae, like the new calendar, became New Year's Day. The ancient Roman calendar, Kalendae Martiae, was used in the Venetian Republic until 1797, and in Russia from 988 to the end of the 15th century. In Russia, September 1 was New Year's Day from the end of the 15th century until the introduction of the Western Calendar in 1700. In the Catholic liturgical calendar, the first day of the abdication was the beginning of the year. In the French calendar, Autumn is the New Year's Day. In China, \"New Year\" refers to January in the lunar calendar. In Japan, New Year's Day is called 'New Year's Day 1' or 'New Year's Day 1' in China. \"New Year\" was originally an alias for January of the old lunar calendar. After the calendar change, it means January of the new calendar. Today, it is sometimes used to mean 'Three Days' or 'Matsunouchi.' Matsunouchi originally ran until January 15, but it is often used until January 7 at present. On January 6 (old lunar calendar), the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) ordered the delivery of decorations on January 7 (old lunar calendar).

There was also a ripe word for data processing, mainly in the industrial sector, and a three-character word for EDP. The meaning of the term \"computing\" came to mean a wide range of things including them, and computer science became the science of dealing with them. In the 1960s, computer science was established as an independent field of study, and the Department of Computer Science was established and accredited at universities.

His date of birth is unknown, and he was born as a son of Toyotoki YAMANA, Inaba Shugo (provincial constable of Inaba Province). His first appearance in historical materials was on January 15, 1486 (according to \"Shuken Nichiroku\"). Since then, his accompaniment to Shogun Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA has been seen frequently. In September 1487, he took part in Yoshihisa ASHIKAGA's conquest of Rokkaku as his father Toyotoki's name. In August 1491, he went to Kyoto with his father and served in the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) on the morning of the 23rd, and served in the conquest of Rokkaku by Yoshiki ASHIKAGA on the 27th. In February 1493, he took part in Yoshiki's expedition to Kawachi. During the Meio Coup in April of the same year, his father Toyotoki belonged to Yoshizumi ASHIKAGA's side, while he himself belonged to Yoshiki's camp. However, it seems that this was just for the purpose of observing both camps, and by the time Yoshiki was captured on April 25, Yoshiki had already left Yoshiki's camp. It is believed that the succession of the head of the family was carried out during the Bunka era, and on March 23, 1504, it was the first time for a shugo (provincial constable) to recognize the service of the Kitagawa clan in the Battle of Shiyaguchi, Mibe Province. It has become clear that the Inaba shugo family was placed under the strong influence of the Tajima shugo family since the connection with Tadatoyo YAMANA of the Tajima shuryo family was confirmed shortly after he assumed the position of shugo (provincial constable) and Toyoshige's intention was scattered among the kokujin. In February 1506, he was ordered to conserve Yamada-betsunomiya in Hoki Province, the territory of Iwashimizu Hachiman-gu Shrine, together with Toyo. At that time, it was planned to advance to Hoki in order to subjugate Sumiyuki YAMANA, a Shugo of Hoki, but it was not until December of the same year. In a letter to the Taso clan, it is recorded that Toyoshige was angry with Sumiyuki's actions as 'Language Dodan,' and that he had a strong sense of crisis about Sumiyuki's actions to expel the former Shugo (provincial constable) Naoyuki YAMANA with the support of Tsunehisa AMAGO (according to the \"Aoi Domain Shochoroku\" (a collection of records compiled in the Edo period) 'A copy of Toyoshige YAMANA'). In October 1504, he informed the Ouchi clan that he would cooperate with Yoshiki in Kyoto, and in February 1508, he was asked to go to Kyoto from Yoshizumi ASHIKAGA to prepare for Yoshiki's army, but he ignored it.",

In 326 BC, he invaded India and defeated the Paulava at the Battle of Hydaspes. However, at the request of many of his subordinates, he eventually returned. In 323 BC, he died at the age of 32 of a fever in Babylon, where he planned to become the capital without completing any new expeditions, including an invasion of Arabia. After his death, his empire was divided by civil war (Diadoquois War) and divided and ruled by the Macedonian successor (Diadoquois). The cultural propagation and syncretism created by Alexander's conquest of Hellenism can be found in Greek Buddhism. He built more than 20 cities after his name, most notably Alexandria of Egypt. Alexander's control of the Greek colony and its transmission to the east of Greek culture combined ancient Greek and Oriental civilizations, resulting in the emergence of a new civilization called Hellenism. This aspect also appeared in the culture of the Eastern Roman Empire in the mid-15th century, and in the 1920s, Greek speakers from the middle of Anatolia to the far east (Pontos).

He spent much of his reign in unparalleled warfare (eastern expeditions) in Asia and North Africa, and by the age of 30 he had built a large empire from Greece to the northwest of India.

He initially weakened the power of feudal lords and promoted the centralization of the kingdom. When David IV was able to concentrate on dealing with foreign threats by gaining power, he won a major victory at the Battle of Didgori in 1121. The Georgian army then pursued the Serjuk army for several days, securing a large number of boots and gaining Tbilisi. Seeing the prosperity of the kingdom, David IV became the first king of Georgia to bear no posthumous titles in the Eastern Roman Empire. This means insisting on the duality of the Kingdom of Georgia and the Eastern Roman Empire. After Maria Bagrathioni married the Eastern Roman Emperor Michael VII Ducas, in the 12th century at least 16 Georgian royalty received their posthumous title in the Eastern Roman Empire, the last of which was David. David IV tried to eliminate the influence from the east and incorporated the Christian and Eastern Roman cultures of the west. The construction of the gelati monastery was part of it, and became the center of the Orthodox faith of the time. The monastery became a cultural heritage registered by UNESCO today. David IV also revived the tradition of Georgian chant and composed several \"repent hymns\" (Georgian:  , galobani sinanulisani). The prosperity of the kingdom continued during the reign of David IV's son Demetre I. In his reign, there was a struggle for succession to the throne, but Georgia remained central and retained its military power. He made a decisive victory against the Muslims at Ganja. Demetre I, like his father, was talented as a poet and sang many Georgian chant. The most famous of these is Thou Art a Vineyard, a hymn representing the modern Georgian Orthodox Church.

However, the population of the kingdom declined and the economy was devastated after suffering from several Black Deaths and Timur invasions brought by nomads. In 1453, the fall of Constantinople destroyed the kingdom's ancient ally, the Eastern Roman Empire. By the end of the 15th century, the kingdom was surrounded by Turks and Iranians, and the Christian Kingdom of Georgia was isolated. The invasion of Timur began in 1386 and eventually resulted in the collapse of the kingdom in 1466. Anarchy continued until 1490, when the Kingdom of Imeleti, the Kingdom of Kahiti, and the Kingdom of Cartri mutually approved independence. Georgia's reunification would have to wait until 1762 when the Kingdom of Cartri and the Kingdom of Kahti were united and the Kingdom of Kahiti was established. The Kingdom of Kahiti was annexed to the Russian Empire in the 18th century. The origins of the Bagrathionian dynasty can be traced back to the time of Tao Clargeti in the 8th century. In 888, the Georgian throne was revived by Adarnasse IV, who called himself the \"King of the Georgians\". The United Kingdom of Georgia was established in 1008. That year, Baglat III, who had already inherited the throne of Tao Clargeti from his father's side, took over the throne of Abkhazia from his mother's side and unified Georgia. The Golden Age of Georgia is the highest period of the Kingdom of Georgia, from the end of the 11th to the 13th century. During this period, the kingdom developed greatly and the medieval Georgian architecture, painting, poetry, and other cultures flourished. Christian art and secular literature developed during this period, and the kingdom prospered in military, political, economic and cultural affairs. This period is known as Georgian Renaissance or Eastern Renaissance.",

In 1578, in the Higashi-Harima region, Nagaharu BESSHO rebelled against him and, together with his older brother, he was forced to take control and attacked Tajima again, who had retreated from control. In the same year, he participated in the Battle of Kuroi-jo Castle as a reinforcement. In 1579, he attacked Mt. Nijo in order to cut off the supply of Nagaharu BESSHO to Miki-jo Castle. He then attacked Awakawa-jo Castle, but was withdrawn by the plan of Sadanori AWAKAWA. However, Sadanori set fire to the castle and retreated to Miki-jo Castle, so he succeeded in cutting the supply route (the Battle of Miki). From Takeda-jo Castle in Tajima Province, they invaded Amada-gun and Ikaruga-gun counties in the northern part of Tanba Province, captured Ayabe-jo Castle of the Eda clan, and forced them to surrender. In January 1580, the Bessho clan committed seppuku and the Miki War ended. In the same year, Hideyoshi's army defeated Arikoyama-jo Castle in Tajima Province and completed the suppression of Tajima Province. After the war, he was given more than 105,000 koku of seven counties of Tajima Province and two counties of Harima Province. In May of the same year, he entered Arikoyama-jo Castle. Atsutane YAMANA, the son of Atsutoyo, was called as a vassal of the Hashiba family and served in the attack on Tottori-jo Castle. As a result, many Tajima kokujin became vassals of the Hashiba family. In March 1581, Tsuneie YOSHIKAWA entered Tottori-jo Castle from the Mori family. Hideyoshi surrounded Tottori-jo Castle and began to attack the army (the Battle of Tottori-jo Castle). Hidenaga also commanded one of the camps encircled by Tottori-jo Castle. In October of the same year, the war ended due to Tsuneie's seppuku. In April 1582, Hideyoshi's army besieged Bicchu Takamatsu-jo Castle and launched a water attack (the Battle of Bicchu Takamatsu-jo Castle). Hidenaga took part in the battle in the vicinity of Mt. Tsuzumi. In June, Muneharu SHIMIZU, the lord of the castle, committed seppuku (suicide by disembowelment) due to the effect of water attack. On June 21, 1582, when Nobunaga ODA died in a revolt by Mitsuhide AKECHI (the Honnoji Incident), Hideyoshi's army immediately signed a peace treaty with the Mori family, which was in a state of battle, and began to withdraw to the Kinai region. Hidenaga participated in the Battle of Yamazaki in accordance with Hideyoshi's 'China Great Return' and, together with Takataka KURODA, he defended Mt. Tenno. In 1583, he participated in the Battle of Shizugatake.",

He was a younger paternal half-brother of Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI (there is also a theory that he was a younger paternal half-brother). He played an active role in the Toyotomi government both inside and outside Japan in terms of political affairs and military affairs, and contributed to the unification of the whole country. In the end, a part of Kawachi Province was added to the three provinces of Yamato, Kii and Izumi, and it became a daimyo (Japanese feudal lord) of about 110 million koku. He was also called Yamato Dainagon (chief councilor of state) because he was promoted to Junii (Junior Second Rank) Gon Dainagon (provisional chief councilor of state). Hideyoshi placed Hidenaga next to him, and Hidenaga was a person who could oppose Hideyoshi and control him. He grew up in a short period of time and was a coordinator of the Toyotomi government, which had foreign-style daimyo (feudal lords) such as Ieyasu TOKUGAWA and Masamune DATE, and was an indispensable and valuable person for the stability of the government. In 1540, he was born in Nakamura, Aichi County, Owari Province (present Nakamura Ward, Nagoya City) as the son of Takeami and Hideyoshi's younger paternal half-brother (according to one theory, his younger brother). As Hideyoshi left the house when he was a child, it is thought that he had little insight. In the battle against Ryuko SAITO, he often served as rusuiyaku of the castle in place of Hideyoshi who participated in the battle. In 1573, when Hideyoshi became the lord of Nagahama-jo Castle due to his achievements in destroying the Azai clan, he sometimes served as the lord of the castle. Three years later, in 1576, Takatora FUJIDO, Hidenaga's right-handed man, served the post, and this master-servant relationship continued until Hideyasu, Hidenaga's adopted son, died young. In 1574, Hideyoshi was unable to fight against the Echizen Ikko Ikki, so he went to the battle to subdue the Nagashima Ikko Ikki as an agent of Hideyoshi (\"Nobunaga Koki\"). In 1575, he was given the family name Hashiba. When Hideyoshi became the commander-in-chief of the attack on China by Nobunaga's order, he was entrusted with the command of Sanindo and Tajima Province. In a letter written by Hideyoshi to Takataka KURODA, he became the most important person in Hideyoshi's camp, such as the name 'Koichiro' (common name of Hidenaga) as a pronoun for trust (Kuroda Marquis family document). In 1577, he accompanied Hideyoshi to Harima Province, and after that, he participated in the attack on Tajima.",

It is said to have originated in the 1860 U.S. presidential election when Lincoln published elephants as a symbol of party strength in newspapers, followed by satirical painter Thomas Nast, who compared Republicans to elephants, and was adopted as a symbol of the party in the 1870s. It was formed in 1854 as a federation of northern movements against Southern slavery. Following the election of Abraham Lincoln as the party's first president in the 1860 U.S. presidential election, he overwhelmed the Democratic Party between the Third Party and the Fourth Party (from 1860 to 1932). Under the current Fifth Party system, the government is repeatedly changing with opposition to the Democratic Party. Initially progressive, it became a conservative party by the mid-20th century. Today, the Democratic Party is generally classified as \"liberal\" and the Republican Party as \"conservative\". The party's basic philosophy is a \"small government\" that places importance on the market economy and minimizes government intervention in the market. It was initially supported by Northern industrialists and farmers, but changed with the conservatism, and while the Democrats are now based in urban areas, the Republicans are based in rural areas in the Midwest and South. So far, there have been 19 Republican presidents, more than any other party. As of this year, the party controls the majority of the Senate, the majority of the governorship, and the majority of the state legislature (29) and 21 state governments. Six of the nine incumbent Supreme Court justices were appointed by the Republican president. In the 1850s, when the Republican Party was formed in the United States, the idea of \"free labor\" spread in the rapidly-industrialized North, while in the South there was plantation management through the use of black slaves.",

It is intended to observe the space itself (such as solar winds and magnetic fields) or to explore planets, satellites, sun, comets, and asteroids. Although it is currently limited to exploration in the Solar System due to the limitations of technology, some scientists are considering flying a probe outside the Solar System in the distant future. Human space exploration began with the Moon, which is the closest and actually closeest to human beings. Human interest in the Moon has long been described as a story (such as \"Taketori Monogatari\"), and the rapid technological development after the Industrial Revolution allowed space probes to be sent directly to the outer celestial body (or to the surface of the celestial body) in order to satisfy the intellectual curiosity of mankind. The first non-Earth celestial probe in human history was the Luna 1 spacecraft of the Soviet Union. Luna 1 approached the Moon for the first time, and although it was originally planned to collide, it took a course that deflected the Moon from orbit and became an artificial planet orbiting the Sun. The next Luna 2 has reached the Moon for the first time in human history and has successfully collided. For the first time in the world, Luna 9 made a soft landing on the lunar surface. Although there was little research on the landing, it was the first time that it had landed on another celestial body. The Luna series continued, with Luna 16 taking back the lunar soil samples on unmanned probes, and Luna 17 running an unmanned lunar vehicle (Rnohort) and conducting various surveys. On the other hand, the United States, where space technology was lagging behind the Soviet Union during the Cold War, was fiercely opposed and competition for space development took place. Starting with the Pioneer and Rainger program, the United States soft-landed Surveyor 1 on the Moon and sent unmanned probes one after another.

However, Ujisato died in 1595. His legitimate son Hideyuki succeeded to the position at the age of 13. However, it was not easy to control the territory of 900,000 koku as the chinju (provincial constable) of the Tohoku region, and the territory was reduced to 180,000 koku due to a grudge among senior vassals. It was Kagekatsu UESUGI, the lord of Kasugayama-jo Castle in Echigo Province, who entered Aizu instead of the Mibu family. The territory was 1.2 million koku (crop yields) including Higashi-Ashihara and Sado in the former territory of Mibu and Dewa-toge Pass, which was the third highest yield after the Mori family (including Ieyasu TOKUGAWA and Terumoto MORI (Tsunemoto's Shuindaka was 11.2 million koku)) (including Hidekane KOBAYAKAWA and Ehime Ankoku-ji Temple, which had territories apart from Terumoto in Kyushu and Shikoku).

However, it is said that Naoe's own territory was 60,000 koku, and since Naoe was in a position to administer the entire Uesugi family, he dispatched Jodai to Yonezawa and supported Kagekatsu at his base Wakamatsu-jo Castle. When Hideyoshi died in August 1598 and Toshiie MAEDA died in March 1599, Ieyasu TOKUGAWA's power became outnumbered within the Toyotomi government, and Ieyasu repeatedly married Masamune and other daimyo without permission. Mitsunari ISHIDA, Gobugyo (five magistrates) approached Kanetsugu NAOE, and when Naoe returned to Aizu in August 1599 with Kagekatsu, he began to strengthen his army by opening a mountain path in his territory, gathering military equipment and ronin (masterless samurai) and building 28 branch castles.

The \u03c9-6 and \u03c9-3 systems cannot be synthesized by animals, making them a broad and essential fatty acid. Many plant oils are rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids and are often rich in linoleic acid, but some plant oils are also rich in \u03b1-linolenic acid. It is possible to increase the unsaturated bond of fatty acids by enzymes such as fatty acid desaturase from \u03c9-3 fatty acids and \u03c9-6 fatty acids as raw materials in the body of animals including humans, and to synthesize polyunsaturated fatty acids having a higher unsaturated degree by extending two carbons. The cell membrane is fluid and the lipids and membrane proteins are active. This fluidity is determined by the constituent material of the membrane. For example, the insufficiency of fatty acids that make up phospholipids (the number of double bonds), and the more hydrocarbons with double bonds, the lower the interaction of phospholipids, and the more fluidity. The more unsaturated the interaction becomes, the lower the melting point of the fatty acid. DHA, a polyunsaturated fatty acid of \u03c9-3 fatty acids, is the main component of fatty acids found in semen, brain and retinal phospholipids. Intake of DHA reduces the amount of neutral fat in the blood and reduces the risk of heart disease. Polyunsaturated fatty acids of \u03c9-6 fatty acids become synthetic precursors of physiologically active substances such as prostaglandins, thromboxane, and leukotriene in mammals such as humans. Under severe conditions of deficiencies in essential fatty acids, mammals elongate and unsaturate oleic acid and produce medic acid (20:3, n\u22129), a polyunsaturated fatty acid of \u03c9-9 fatty acids.",

It is thought to have been formed by collisions of about 10 Mars-sized protoplanetary planets. As a planet in the Solar System, it is located within two astronomical units from the Sun, and is classified as a \"terrestrial planet\" with a rocky outer layer and a core composed mainly of iron, and is the largest of the Earth-shaped planets in the Solar System, both in size, mass and density. The composition varies depending on the depth from the ground surface. The main elements in the crust are oxygen (49.5% mass ratio) and silicon (25.8% mass ratio), including metallic elements such as aluminum, iron, calcium, sodium, potassium, and magnesium. The mass centigrade for each element is shredded as the Clark number. Most of them exist in the form of metal oxides, such as silicates. In contrast, the center part is mainly iron and nickel. 71.1% of the earth's surface is covered by liquid water (sea), and there is an atmosphere mainly composed of nitrogen and oxygen in the range from the surface to about 100 km above the surface. The composition of the atmosphere varies with altitude. Since the earth is almost spherical, the extent to which a person standing on the surface of the earth at 0 m above sea can be seen at once is limited to the inside of a circle with a radius of 3 km to 5 km where a horizontal line occurs. An easy-to-understand example is a ship sailing in the distance, a long straight-line bridge, and a row of power transmission towers standing on the surface of the water, sinking downward when approaching the horizontal line, and hiding in the sea surface. In addition, there is a restriction that wireless communication without ionization layer, communication satellite or relay line can only be communicated within a prospect distance to the horizontal line. In addition, when the latitude changes, there is a difference in the celestial body that can be seen at night. Since the evidence that the earth is a sphere is hard to realize to a living person, the horizon theory was once believed. It orbits in an elliptical orbit close to the circle and rotates around the Sun once in the 1.0000 solar year and once in the 0.973 average solar day. From the point of view of the sky's North Pole, both rotation and revolution are counterclockwise.

Many other languages, such as English (Earth) and Latin (Tellus, Terra), use the term \"terrestrial\". In Japanese, the word \"Earth,\" which is the name of this star, is derived from Chinese. The Chinese word \"Earth\" was first seen during the Ming dynasty's Eastern Alumni period, and the Italian missionary Mateo Ricci (1552 \u2013 1610)'s \"All the World's Nations\" was the earliest document to use the word. As Western modern science entered China in the late Qing dynasty, the theory of the Earth became increasingly accepted by Chinese people, and the word \"Earth\" (or terrestrial) became widely used. In the original issue of the newspaper's report at that time, a text concerning the 'Earth Theory' was published. In Japan, this Chinese language was imported around the Edo period, and there are examples of its use in Western Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan) and the Wakan Sansai-zukai (The Three Ages of Japanese and Chinese) around the 1700s.

These developments were recommended by Alessandro Stradella (1644 \u2013 1682) and are typically shown in the works of Alessandro Scarlatti (1660 \u2013 1725). Of the approximately 600 Cantatas composed by Scarlatti, about 500 were for Soprano solos and bass, leaving the influence of earlier generations of composers in the early cantatas, but in Cantatas composed in the second Roman era from 1703 onwards, the two songs were based on a recitatevo-included movement in front of Da Carpo Alia, which became the standard style of the secular cantata throughout the 18th century. Furthermore, in Cantata, which he composed in his later years, he pursued a rich expression of half-syllable harmony and bold tone, which led to his reputation as \"extraordinary and irrational harmony\" by Johann Darphyt Heinichen. After Scarlatti's death, the composition of the chamber cantata was succeeded by Giovanni Bononcini (1670 \u2013 1747), Leonardo Vinci (1690 \u2013 1730) and Leonardo Leio (1694 \u2013 1744), but in Vinci and Leo's cantata, four-song ensembles and bass accompaniment became common, and by the latter half of the 19th century, there was little distinction between Shana and aria in opera, and the independent form was lost. Cantata in Germany during the Baroque period differed from Italy in that it developed mainly in the field of religious music. Church Cantata in Germany, in a narrow sense, refers to the lyrics of Eltmann Neumeister (1671 \u2013 1756) and his successors, who adopted free poems in the Madrigal\u00e9 style for church music, but today it is common to include religious works composed in the 17th century as a vocal composition consisting of several independent movements played in the service of the Protestant Church. An older type of church in the 17th century, the Cantata, is composed mainly of vocal and instrumental concerts based on chant, and aria and corale arrangements in syllable form.",

The earliest cantatas were not formally established, and Eleanor Carouri classified Cantata until around 1670 as \"arietta corta\" consisting of a single aria, and \"arietta dipij parti\", in which aria and recitativo are used according to lyrics. In fact, many of the cantatas written by Alessandro Grandi (1575 \u2013 1630) and Luigi Rossi (1597 \u2013 1653) are in the form of a monody-style syllable. On the other hand, when it came to Cantata composed by Jakomo Kalissim (1605 - 1674) and Antonio chessti (1623 - 1669), it generally included several arias, and the distinction between retitatevo, aryos and aria became clear, and in retitatevo it became lyrical with the rise of lyrics and transitioned to aryoso. In Italy at that time, Cantata was an ethical work in which a personified soul and body appeared, but most of them dealt with romance based on pastoral or historical subjects, and although it resembled an operatic scene, it did not involve acting and had a more intimate atmosphere in both music and lyrics. The centerpiece of Cantata composition was Rome, many of which were intended to be played for a small number of aristocratic patrons with high appreciation, and included refined hobbies and sometimes experimental elements that tend to be lost in large opera houses.",

As tensions increased, the United Kingdom adopted the United Nations Partition Resolution in 1947, which recommended the establishment of an independent Arab-Jewish state and an internationalized Jerusalem, in order to soothe both Arab and Jewish factions. The following year, the Jewish authorities declared Israel's independence, and during the 1948 Arab-Israel War, Israel occupied most of the British mandate, but the West Bank of the Jordan River and Gaza were occupied by neighboring Arab countries. Since the Third Middle East War in June 1967, Israel has held occupied areas such as the West Bank of the Jordan River, the Golan Plateau, and the Gaza area. With subsequent legislative measures, Israel's laws were fully enforced on the Golan Plateau and East Jerusalem, while the western bank of the Jordan River was partially applied by \"pipe lining\" to Israeli settlements. The Israeli occupation of the Palestinian Autonomous Region is internationally considered to be the world's longest military occupation in modern times. Although efforts to resolve the conflict between Israel and Palestine have not reached a final peace agreement, Israel has concluded a peace treaty with Egypt and Jordan. In the basic law, Israel defines itself as a Jewish and democratic state and a Jewish national state. The state is a free-democratic state with a parliamentary system, proportional representation system, and a general election. The Prime Minister is the head of the government, and Kneset is the legislative body. As of 2019, it has a population of about 9 million, and Israel is an advanced country and an OECD member. It is the 29th largest nominal GDP economy in the world and the most advanced country in the ongoing conflict. It ranks at the top of the world in terms of the highest level of living in the Middle East, the proportion of people trained in military training, the proportion of people with higher education degrees, the cost of research and development of GDP ratios, women's safety, average life expectancy, innovation, and happiness.

It is bordered by Lebanon to the north, Syria to the northeast, Jordan to the east, the West Bank of the Jordan River and the Gaza District of the Palestinian Autonomous Region to the east and west, and Egypt to the southwest.

The existence of the Canans in Israel has been archaeologically proven since the middle of the Bronze Age, and the Kingdom of Israel and the Kingdom of Judas were created during the Iron Age. Around 720 BC, the New Assyrian Empire destroyed the Kingdom of Israel. The Kingdom of Judas was then conquered by the Babylonian Empire, the Persian Empire, and the Hellenistic Empire. The Makabai War was successful, and in 110 BC it became an independent country of the Hasmons, but in 63 BC it became a subordinate of the Roman Republic, in 37 BC the Herodian dynasty was established, and in 6 AD the Jewish provinces of the Roman Empire were created. As a result of the Jewish uprising, the Jewish province was devastated, and the Jews were expelled and remained as Roman provinces until their name was changed to Syrian Palestina. The existence of Jews in the region has continued to some extent over the centuries. The Levant region, which was seized by Arabs from the Byzantine Empire in the 7th century, was under Muslim control until the First Crusade in 1099 and the conquest by the Iyubes in 1187. In the 13th century, the Mamluk dynasty of Egypt extended its control over Levant and ruled until it was defeated by the Ottoman Empire in 1517. In the 19th century, the Zionist movement was triggered by the rise of Jewish national consciousness, and it is believed that migration to Palestine began. Palestine was ceded from the Ottoman Empire after the First World War, and became a mandate of the British Empire from 1920 to 1948. At the beginning of World War II, the delegation suffered a massive bombardment, and the Jews of Ichub served on the Confederate side.",

At the 1920 Antwerp Olympics, he paired with Kazuya Kumagaya in the men's doubles of tennis, and was known as the first Japanese athlete to win an Olympic medal. He was born in Osaka Prefecture in 1892. After graduating from Osaka Prefectural Kitano Junior High School (present-day Osaka Prefectural Kitano Senior High School), he graduated from Tokyo Higher Commercial School (present-day Hitotsubashi University) in 1913. Yoshizo SHIMIZU, who later played an active role in the international stage of tennis, was a rival to the garden ball club of Tokyo Higher Commercial School as well as Isoo. After graduating from university, he joined Mitsui & Co. , Ltd. , worked as a representative of Shanghai, New York, and Lyon, and then worked as a general manager of Itobe, Yokohama Branch.

At the 1920 Antwerp Olympics, Kashio competed in two divisions: Men's Singles and Doubles. Although he was defeated in the third round of the singles, he made his final appearance in the doubles paired with Kazuya Kumagaya. In the gold-winning finals, he was defeated by the British team Max Woznam and Ozwald Turnbull 2-6, 7-5, 5-7, 5-7 and won the silver medal. In this way, Seiichiro Shibao became the first Japanese athlete to win an Olympic medal and left a name in the history of the Olympics.

In the Battle of Kasagiyama in September 1331, Awayataro SANO was seen as the side of the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) (\"Taiheiki\"). Due to the fall of the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), the trend of the Kenmu Restoration is unclear. Yoshitsuna SANO and Ichiomaru SANO were active in the Northern Court in the years between the 2nd and 3rd year of the Kenmu eras, according to 'Yoshitsuna SANO' and 'Aboichiomaru SANO's military loyalty' ('Ochiai Monjo'). Yoshitsuna fought against the Abenuma clan, the same clan of the Southern Court, and was killed in the battle on November 3, 1863, and his son Ichiomaru succeeded to the battle and followed the Shiba clan. Ujitsuna SANO participated in the Battle of Yotsutsuji and the Battle of Yamato and Yoshino as the subordinates of KO no Moronao. In addition, the son of Ujitsuna, Taroshiro Hidetsuna SANO, was given shoryo (territory) in Ecchu Province in 1366 according to Yoshitane ASHIKAGA.

In 1355, Morotsuna, Sano Echizen no kami (Governor of Sano Echizen Province), seized the Kamagaya-mura and Arai-mura villages in Saga, and was sued by Doyo SASAKI. According to Eda, Morotsuna was from a branch family of the Uesano family, and it is believed that the head family, Saga SANO, was powerful in the Uesano family, and the head family (the Kunimoto family) moved its base to Ecchu.

The beginning of the U.S. colony's path to independence was driven by the strengthening of British taxation, which was intended to eliminate the financial crisis of the French-Indian War (1754 \u2013 1763). The British government enacted the Sugar Act of 1764 and the Stamp Act of 1765 to increase tax revenues from the colonies, but the Stamp Act, in particular, caused widespread opposition in the United States and was forced to repeal. When the British legislature enacted the Townsend Act in 1767 and tried to impose a new tax on the colony, the opposition was again aroused and the Townsend tariff was abolished in 1770. However, the tax on tea was not abolished at this time, and the home country's tea became a symbol of dissatisfaction with the colony. When the Tea Act of 1773 brought the British East India Company's tea to the colony cheaply, the anger of colonial merchants peaked, and in December 1773 a mob entered the East India Company ship anchored at Boston Harbor and dumped the loaded tea into the sea (Boston Tea Ceremony). In 1774, the British Parliament carried out a series of punitive legislative measures against the colony. In such a crisis, William Pitt, Earl of Chatham, worked with Benjamin Franklin, who was in England, to urge Congress to reconcile with the colony. However, Prime Minister Frederick North, against the backdrop of King George III's strong will, decided to take a firm stance toward the colony. In response to a series of British policies, the Thirteen Colonies held a Continental Congress to discuss countermeasures and explored the path to reconciliation with the British Homeland, but remained unopened. At the beginning of the war, there was no professional army or navy in the United States, and there were only local militia units in each colony, which were in charge of their own defenses. In the United States before the Revolutionary War, the British used each colony's militia in a subsidized manner. At the outbreak of the war, almost all of the militia, with the exception of some, joined the U.S. Continental Army. The militia's equipment was simple, almost untrained, and there were no regular uniforms.",

In 1978, biologist John Webber concluded that the yellowstone wolves were extinct. Local ranchers and environmental groups have been discussing the reintroduction for years. The idea of reintroduction was first submitted to Congress by biologists in 1966. These biologists were concerned that Yellowstone's wapiti had increased to the point of crisis. However, ranchers strongly opposed the re-introduction of wolves to the problem of livestock being attacked. The U.S. government was responsible for the creation, development, and implementation of the compromise, and continued to make efforts over the course of about 20 years to find the compromise. The wolf recovery team was appointed in 1974, and in 1982 the first official Recovery Plan was published to gather opinions. Due to general anxiety about the reintroduction of wolves, the Fish and Wildlife Service changed its plan to make it easier for state and local governments to make decisions. Thus, a second recovery plan for gathering opinions was published in 1985. In a survey of visitors to Yellowstone National Park in the same year, 74% said the wolf might be needed to improve the park, while 60% agreed to reintroduce it. The final stage before the approval of the reintroduction was a preliminary assessment (environmental assessment) of the impact of the reintroduction. Congress suspended the plan, saying further research was needed before spending on environmental assessments. In 1987, ranchers demanded compensation for the economic burden of reintroduction proposals. On the other hand, Defenders of Wildlife has set up a \u201cwolf compensation fund\u201d to compensate ranchers for the market price of livestock lost to wolf damage. In the same year, the final recovery plan was announced.

After studying in various parts of Europe, he became a medical practitioner in London. In 1777, he was invited to France, where he worked until 1783 with his brother, Count of Altowa (later Charles I). From that time on, he started an anti-establishment movement. After the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789, he issued a newspaper, The Friends of the People, which was supported by the lower class by radical government attacks. As a result, he fled to Great Britain in January 1790. He returned to the Club des Cordeliers in April and is said to have led to the September massacre of the Tuileries and anti-revolutionaries on 10 August. In 1792, he was elected a member of the National Convention and was a member of the Jacovan faction. He attacked the Girondos, who led the legislature, and was briefly arrested, but was soon released, uprisinging the Parisians and eventually banishing them from the National Convention.

He became inactive and spent the whole day bathing and recuperating at his home (present-day \u00c9cole-de-Medusine (fr) 20th Street, 6th Ward, Paris). In 1793, he was assassinated by Girondoist supporter Charlotte Colday. After the assassination, the painter Jacques-Louis David painted the famous The Death of Maler on the scene. It was deified by Jacoban ally Maximilian Robespierre and became the pretext of reinforcing the Girondos.

Yoritsugu MATSUDAIRA, the fourth lord of the domain, issued a contract order to rebuild the domain's finances, but he retired at the age of 22 because it was difficult to reform the domain administration due to his weak health, and Yorisuke MATSUDAIRA (the third son of Yorimune) was adopted by the Kii Tokugawa family as the fifth lord of the domain. Yoritsugu also called himself Harusada TOKUGAWA from the Wakayama Domain. Yoritaka was succeeded by Yoritaka MATSUDAIRA, a son of Munemasa TOKUGAWA, the lord of the Wakayama Domain.

In the early Edo period, the Ichiyanagi family of Tozama daimyo (feudal lord of Tozama Province) governed the family, but it was abolished after about 30 years of the third generation. In 1670, one of the Tokugawa Gosanke (three branches of Tokugawa family) of the Kii-Tokugawa family entered the domain with a fief of 30,000 koku, and remained as a branch domain of the Wakayama Domain until Haihan-chiken (abolition of feudal domains and establishment of prefectures). In the field of local history, the Saijo Domain of the Ichiyanagi clan is sometimes called 'the first Saijo Domain,' and the Saijo Domain of the Matsudaira clan is sometimes called 'the second Saijo Domain.' In 1636, Naomori ICHIYANAGI, the lord of Ise Kobe's 50,000 koku crop yield, received an increase of 18,000 koku crop yield and was transferred to Saijo with a total of 68,000 koku crop yield (of which 5,000 koku crop yielded to his second son Naoie, so it is sometimes described as 63,000 koku crop yields). This established the Saijo Domain, which had shoryo (territory) across Nii County, Uma County, Shushiki County, Iyo Province, and Kato County, Harima Province, but Naomori died on the way to Osaka in the same year. Naomori's estate was divided by three sons, Naoshige KUSUNOKO inherited 30,000 koku and became the lord of Saijo Domain, his second son Naoie became a daimyo with 28,000 koku (from the Iyogawanoe Domain to Harima Ono Domain), and his third son Naoyori became a daimyo with 10,000 koku (from the Iyo Komatsu Domain). It can be said that it was Naoshige, the second, who effectively established the Saijo Domain with 30,000 koku. Naoshige built the original model of Nishijo jinya and its jinya-cho. Naoshige's son, Naooki, gave 5,000 koku to his younger brother, Naoteru, and the Saijo Domain yielded 25,000 koku. However, in 1665, Naooki was deprived of his duties due to his negligence of duties and his political failure. After that, Saijoryo became Kogi goryo (the land ruled by daikan [local governors]) after passing through the place where Tokushima Domain and Matsuyama Domain were in custody.

In response, Mrs Herzogemberg praised the depth and unity of the work, but expressed concern that the technique was too complicated, saying, \"I think it would appeal to the 'eyes' of analytical experts rather than the ears of the good audience of the general public.\" On 8 October of the same year, Brahms invited his friends to Vienna before the premiere, where he and Ignat Brull performed two piano versions of the song. The concert with Brull has been a tradition since the second symphony. According to biographer Max Calbec, awkward silence covered the area at the end of the first movement. The reactions of Eduard Hansrick and Hans Richter were both positive and negative, and Calbec suggested that the latter two movements should be rewritten differently. After its premiere in February 1886, Joseph Joachim recommended revising the beginning of the song, and Brahms agreed to write a short introduction of four bars. Later, however, Brahms disappeared and the original idea could not be changed. It was premiered on October 25, 1885, by the Meiningen Court Orchestra, under Brahms' own direction. At the premiere, a long applause took place for each movement, and the third movement was immediately recalled on the spot, and the first and third movements were played at the request of George II, Duke of Miningen. The following week, he was also played by Hans von B\u00fclow. Brahms traveled between Germany and the Netherlands on a tour of the band from November. Like some of Brahms' friends, some critics took the old-fashioned attitude of \"backwards\" of the seemingly apparent method. Hugo Wolfe, who was a Wagnerian at the time and was at the head of Brahms's criticism, described the symphony as a regression of Brahms's creative activities and a remark of \"unconventional, empty and hypocrisy\". Gustaf Mahler also referred to the song as the \"empty-sounding stool\". On the other hand, Hansrick, who defended Brahms, said in a post-premier review that \"the charm is not for everyone\" and praised his originality, calling the fourth movement \"the finale is like a dark spring. The longer you look at it, the brighter the star's light shines.\"",

The second movement uses the Frigea lathe, and the last movement uses the Baroque version of Chaconne, which is a variant of the Baroque era. As a result, it has been pointed out critically from the beginning that the astringency and technique are too complicated, but now it has been evaluated as a ripe work that incorporates originality and romanticity in the old style, and among the four symphony songs, it is a song that is considered to be the leading in terms of the symphony of Brahms. In contrast to the first, which is long and bright, it is composed of short and short string quartets No. 1 and Piano quartet No. 1 that Sch\u00f6nberg and No. 2 have arranged into orchestral compositions, which have been seen in Brahms' chamber music for a long time. Brahms described himself as \"the best song of his creation\" and \"the best masterpiece\". The performance lasts about 40 minutes. In January 1882, Brahms told his friend and conductor, Hans von B\u00fclow, \"Meine Tage in dem Leide\", the last of Johann Sebastian Bach's Cantata No. 150, \"Nach dir, Herr, verlanget mich\" (BWV.150). This indicates that before the composition of the third symphony, the concept of the finale of the fourth symphony had already emerged. Brahms' experience of using Shaconne's technique for orchestral work was an example of the end of Haydn's Theme Variation (1873). In 1884, at the age of 51, Brahms spent the summer at M\u00fcrztuszlak in southwestern Vienna, where he worked on the composition of the fourth symphony. In that year, he completed the first two movements, and in 1885, he completed the second two.",

In the 1960s and 1970s, when the Melanetic Native Americans of New Caledonia formed political parties and began appealing for independence, Canak became a symbol of the Melanetic political liberation and national pride. In 1983, during the political turmoil that struck New Caledonia, Kanak (KANAK) and Kanakey became political pretexts, and it became widely recognized that the word \"Kanaku\" became a term of strong political insistence. It was \"discovered\" by James Cook in 1774 and became a French territory in 1853. Originally a prison colony, it became a mining island after the discovery of nickel in the late 19th century.

In 1500 BC, the Lapitans reached the present-day New Caledonia and the Loyalty Islands, and advanced navigation, agriculture, and pottery had an impact on a wide range of the Pacific Ocean. The remains of the earthenware still remain in New Caledonia, as well as the Petroglyph of 10,000 years ago by the people who lived in front of them. Since then, the Austronesian language has expanded into Oceania from Taiwan and elsewhere.

The name was derived from the fact that Emperor Gouda, the son of the 90th Emperor Kameyama, who was the Prince of the 88th Emperor Gosaga and the biological younger brother of the 89th Emperor Gofukakusa, made an effort to revive Daikaku-ji Temple in Sagano (Ukyo Ward, Kyoto City) outside Kyoto, and after becoming a priest, he lived in Daikaku-ji Temple and conducted cloister government. In 1258, the Retired Emperor Gosaga adopted the younger brother of Emperor Gofukakusa (at the age of 16), Imperial Prince Tsunehito (later Emperor Kameyama, at the age of 10) as the Crown Prince, and in the following year, 1259, Emperor Gofukakusa abdicated the throne to Imperial Prince Tsunehito. The Retired Emperor Gofukakusa later had a prince, but in 1268, the Retired Emperor Gofukakusa appointed Imperial Prince Korehito (later Emperor Fushimi, then 4 years old), the second Prince of Emperor Kameyama, Imperial Prince Korehito (later Emperor Uda, then 2 years old) as Crown Prince. After that, the Retired Emperor Gosaga passed away in 1272, but the will did not have a sentence to appoint a successor, and only the will was shown that the appointment of the next generation of Chiten should follow the intention of the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun). Therefore, the Retired Emperor Gofukakusa and Emperor Kameyama fought for the next generation of Chiten, and the ruling was brought to the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun). The bakufu asked Daiguin, who was the lawful wife of the Retired Emperor Gosaga and the real mother of the Retired Emperor Gofukakusa and Emperor Kameyama, which was the true intention of the Retired Emperor Gosaga, and since Daiguin named Emperor Kameyama, he appointed Emperor Kameyama as the next Chiten. As a result, Emperor Kameyama remained in office for a while and abdicated the throne to Crown Prince Imperial Prince Kunihito (at the age of eight at that time) in 1274. However, the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) was dissatisfied with the Retired Emperor Gofukakusa, and in 1275, Imperial Prince Atsuhito (at the age of 11) was appointed as the Crown Prince, guaranteeing that the Retired Emperor Gofukakusa would become the next Chiten in the future. The confrontation between Gofukakusa and Kameyama, which occurred in this way, was judged by the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) to succeed the Imperial Throne to the throne for almost ten years and to carry out cloistered government.",

In order to take Jamie's temper, Howard promises to give his children a very popular \"turboman\" figure for Christmas. Howard reconciled with Jamie and was in a good mood, but he completely forgot it until his wife Liz told him to make a reservation a week ago. In addition, he was told that \"turboman figures are popular and understated\", and he rushed to buy them at Christmas Eve. Jaime said, \"I'm going back to the Christmas parade where Turboman appears,\" but no matter where I go, I'm out of stock and I'm laughed at by clerks and customers who say, \"I'm going to buy it now.\" Howard managed to get a figure, and struggled to find a toy shop ahead of mailman Myron, who was also looking for a figure, but he couldn't find it. In such a situation, the two people who heard that \"a figure entered the shopping mall\" went to the shopping mall and took the lottery ticket with other customers and beat each other. Howard tries to get close to the girl with the ball in order to get back the lottery ball he dropped, but is treated as a pervert and kicked out. There, I met a man in Santa and was told that he had a figure, so I went to a nearby factory. Howard, who got the desired figure, realizes that the figure is a fake that resembles the appearance only, and it becomes a battle with Santa in the factory.",

        "paragraph": "This peasant uprising lasted for 11 months until the decision of the bakufu hyojosho in the following year ordered the return of the people of the domain. In 1691, at the same time as the execution of the leader of the uprising, Kiyozumi was deprived of his position and once again demoted to the jinya daimyo (Japanese feudal lord in the jinya region), he was transferred to the Itoigawa Domain in Echigo Province with a yield of 50,000 koku. In 1692, the fudai daimyo (hereditary vassal of the Tokugawa family) Akitaka MIURA entered the domain with 23,000 koku (crop yields) from the Mibu Domain in Shimotsuke Province, and became the most southernmost fudai daimyo domain since then. Although he was the smallest kokudaka in the history of the Nobeoka Domain, Akiyoshi worked hard to solve the boundary problems with the Takanabe Domain, which had continued since the Arima clan, and the border disputes with Bungo Province. It is considered that the difference between Omotedaka and Sanedaka in the Nobeoka Domain was more problematic than before, and it is believed that the Miura clan solved the problem. In 1712, Myokei was transferred to the Kariya Domain in Mikawa Province. Instead, Narinaka MAKINO, from the Yoshida Domain in Mikawa Province, entered the Imperial Palace with the highest yield of 80,000 koku. He owned not only Hyuga Province, but also Oita County, Bungo Province, Kunito County and Hayami County. Sadamichi, the second lord of the domain, was promoted to Sojaban and jisha bugyo (magistrate of temples and shrines) and became Kyoto shoshidai in 1742. At that time, 30,000 koku in Hyuga Province was transferred to the territory of Kawachi, Omi, Tanba and Mino Provinces. With Sadamichi's success, the expenses were reduced, and the finances of the domain became inconvenient. In 1747, the Makino clan was transferred to the Kasama Domain in Hitachi Province due to the change of territory. Instead, Masaki NAITO entered the Imperial Palace with 70,000 koku (crop yields) from the Ibaraki-Heishi Domain in Mutsu Province. Masatsune INOUE entered the Ibaraki-Heishi Domain from the Kasama Domain. The Naito clan was held responsible for the 'Ibaraki Disturbance' in the Ibaraki-Heishi Domain, which was the former territory, and was transferred to Nobeoka punishably. Although the gokudaka on the surface is the same 70,000 koku, it can be seen from the fact that Ibaraki-daira had a real height of 13,000 koku and was substantially reduced by 60,000 koku. The Naito clan stayed there for the longest time and ruled the area for 124 years. Incidentally, the 8th generation of the Naito clan had an unusual record that they were inherited by adopted children. During the reign of the Naito clan, he continued to suffer from financial difficulties and associated peasant uprisings.",

        "paragraph": "The Nobeoka Domain was a domain which owned the northern part of Hyuga Province and the northern part of present-day Miyazaki City, and it also owned parts of Bungo Province from the Makino clan to the Meiji Restoration. Also, because Nobeoka until the time of the Arima clan was called \"Agata\" (prefecture), it was also called \"Agata-han.\" The domain office was Ibaraki (Nagaoka-jo Castle) (Nagaoka City, Miyazaki Prefecture). The domain began in 1587 after Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI conquered Kyushu, when Mototane TAKAHASHI, a feudal lord around Kashun, Buzen Province (Kashun-cho, Tagawa County, Fukuoka Prefecture), was sealed at 50,000 koku of Matsuo-jo Castle in the southern part of Nobeoka. In the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600, the origin was originally the western army. However, he secretly conspired with Tanenaga AKIZUKI, Yorifusa SAGARA, who was a small feudal lord in the southern part of Kyushu, and returned to the eastern army. As a result, the former domain was approved by the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) and the prefectural domain was established. In 1601, Mototane built a prefectural castle (Nenoka-jo Castle) and moved from Matsuo-jo Castle, which became the center of the domain administration until the Meiji Restoration. In 1613, when Kanbe MIZUMA, a criminal of the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), was sheltered in Takachiho, he was deprived of his power and was assigned to Muneshige TACHIBANA, the lord of the domain of Tanakura Domain in Mutsu Province. In 1614, Naozumi ARIMA entered the Imperial Palace with 53,000 koku from the Hinoe Domain in Hizen Province. The second lord of the domain, Yasuzumi, rebuilt Yodo (Nenoka)-jo Castle and established the castle town. During the 38 years of Yasuzumi's reign, the prototype of today's castle town, Nobeoka, was completed. In June 1656, he donated a bell to Imayama Hachiman-gu Shrine (the first 'Jozan bell,' owned by Naito Memorial Museum). The first appearance of the place name of Nobeoka was 'Nagaoka no jimyo (the name of the place in Nobeoka),' which was written in the book 'Yoshihi, June of the first year of the Meireki era... Saemon no suke (Assistant Captain of the Left Division of Outer Palace Guards) Arima, the lord of Nobeoka-jo Castle in Nisshu Province... FUJIWARA no Ason Yasuzumi.' In 1641, he separated 3,000 koku from his younger brother, Junsei, and used it as hatamoto. The third lord of the domain, Eijun (renamed Seijun after the transfer) gave his younger brother Junsoku 1800 koku and Juntomi 1,000 koku of Shinden each. In 1690, in the era of Seijun, about 1,500 people of Yamain Village and Kashitani Village, who were dissatisfied with the oppression of Gundai (local governor) Jurozaemon SHIBATA, had family goods, and the uprising of Sanin and Kashitani Villages, which were scattered to the Takanabe Domain of the neighboring domain with weapons, occurred.",

Another characteristic is that there are characters with \"transformation techniques\". There are many characters in other series that transform into characters other than themselves, such as the boss character \"Shantun\" of \"Motorl Combat,\" but in this series, graphics are prepared only for the character, such as the old woman rejuvenates into a beautiful girl in the Monpe outfit by sucking the spirit of the opponent, and the technique becomes a completely different character. Later in the series, the character has also appeared that it has been transformed into an initial state and that it can be solved under certain conditions. Other than \"the first\" and \"3\", the player character who lost in the victory demonstration is graffitied on the face. The Goshunji family series is made with unusual attention as a fighting game about BGM. In \"2\", \"Geden\" and \"Shin\" there is a groundbreaking attempt to add lyrics to BGM and make it a song. The lyrics are mostly surreal and can be classified as radio songs. In the background, back dancers dance according to the song, and when the round progresses on the same stage, BGM and dance change in the story formation, etc. This series has attracted a lot of attention due to the character characteristics of various characters, such as the main character being old age, and the BGM itself attracted little attention. However, due to the spread of the Internet and the development of the Angra culture on the Internet, it attracted a great deal of attention in an unexpected way. There is a song called \"Let's Go! Onmyoji\" in one of the stage BGMs of \"New Goshuji Family: Matrilee-\" and \"New Goshuji Family: Release of Distress\". This song, which adds Japanese-style tastes such as chopsticks to the development of the Eurobeat style, is called Onmyoji in the title, but Onmyoji, who appears in the game, only sits on the back of Seidai in the center of the screen background and cuts nine characters. In \"New Goshunji family - liberation of distress -\" a PV can be created that can be seen as satisfying certain conditions during the game.",

In later works, there are exceptions such as 'a fighter invited from the outside' and 'an enemy who wants to destroy the family', but basically almost all the contestants are bloody.

The \"CR Goshunji Family\" was developed in Nishijin, a pachinko maker.

The buttons are four-button, punching and kicking, each weak and strong.

It is a term used by the Orthodox Church of Japan. It corresponds to the saints of the Catholic Church and the consecration of the Anglican Protestant Church. The Orthodox Church is not allowed to consecrate other than Orthodox believers who are mutually approved. Most of them are performed in shintai-reigi (ceremony of the sacred body), but in some cases the sick person in the sick bed is subjected to shintai (reverence) or sonji (revered blood) from the priest. Many Slavic Orthodox churches obligate believers to receive condolences prior to their sanctity when they are consecrated in holy rites. On the other hand, there is no such custom in the Greek Orthodox Church, and consularity is carried out without receiving any condolences every time. In sacred rites and rites, ginshu, which became blood, is put in the saint's note 2, and bread, which became blood, is put in the shintai reigi. The devotees receive the dignity and blood from this saint, a spoon of which the priest is called the saint (). It is not normal to consecrate only one person, such as Sontai (bread) or Sonze (sake) only. However, if a sick person is unable to subdue a solid object, there may be cases where only a blood-respecting (sake) is carried out. Also, when carrying a sacred body under a sick person on the bed of the sick, the sacred body which has been changed in advance and stored in the church is used. This is made by pouring sakazaka (sweet sake), which has changed holy, into the bread that has changed holy. In Orthodox churches, fermented bread (prosfora) is used as a valuable substance. It differs from Western churches in that it uses unfermented bread (hostier or wafer). In addition to the Holy Land, a blessed sacrament (a piece of bread) called 'Antidol' is performed after the cross crossing at the end of the saint's rite. Even those who are not baptized or believers of other sects other than the Orthodox Church can be invited to congratulate all those who have participated in the prayers.",

His other names were Koki, Jinmukigen, Enthronement Kigen, Sumerakoyomi, Koreki, Jinmureki, Nikki, and so on. In Japan, until the enthronement of Emperor Jinmu was established in 1872, the era name and zodiac were used (or used in combination with them) as a chronological law, and the method of 'kigen' was not used to count the year according to the year of the Emperor's succession and the year of the Emperor's enthronement. After the Meiji Restoration, the government decided to change the calendar and adopt the solar calendar in accordance with the Western calendar and use the kigen as the chronology. In 1872, the government proclaimed the change of the calendar from the Taiin solar calendar to the solar calendar, and six days later, it proclaimed the enthronement of Emperor Jinmu as Kigen (1) (for details, refer to 'Establishment' in the later section).

Before the war and during the war (before the Second World War), the term 'Kigen' simply referred to the era of Emperor Jinmu's enthronement (Koki).

However, only gengo (original names) were used in official documents issued to local public organizations such as family registers and official documents for domestic use by the government, and it was not until the Showa period that koki came to be used frequently. Another example in which Koki was consistently used before World War II was a national history textbook. After the war (after the Second World War), the term 'Kigen' often refers to the western calendar. After the war, the era of Emperor Jinmu's enthronement was almost unused, and it was not used in official documents of the government.",

Since then, the Iyubes, Mamluks and other dynasties have called themselves Sultan's monarchs under the approval of the Abbasid Caliphate, and used them for their authority, but they do not necessarily require the appointment of Caliphs, as the emperors of the Holy Roman Empire, often compared, were crowned to Rome. In the Ottoman period, the first name of Sultan was Orhan, the second, and he called himself \"Sultan Slayman Shah Han\" in combination with the titles of Shah and Han. Later, when the Ottoman Empire developed, the title of Purdyshire became common, but the term \"Sultan\" came to be used in front of the monarchy, the term \"Sultan of the Sultan\", and the title \"Sultan\" was also used as the title of the prince's empress or daughter. In the 19th century, when the claim of the \"Sultan-Calyph system\" emerged, the monarchs of the Ottoman Empire were considered to combine the secular power of Sultan and the religious authority of Calyph. The monarchs of Oman, Brunei, and Malaysia now use the title Sultan. Indonesia has been a republic since its founding, but for special reasons only sultan has existed in the special province of Jogyakarta, and sultan has been granted the status of sultan. The Jogyakarta Special State was once the hereditary and lifetime governor of Sultan, but after the collapse of the old system, the governor was elected, and although the hereditary governor system was nominally abolished, Sultan (Hamenkbuwano 10) was elected as the governor of Sultan.",

        "paragraph": "When the Greenwich meridian was adopted as the first meridian at the International Meridian Conference in Washington, D.C. in 1884, most countries' time zones were based on this GMT, and only a few hours advanced (or delayed) time was adopted as standard time. In 1911, at the International Astronomical Conference on the Prototyping of the National Calendar in Paris, it was decided to use a standard Greenwich time for all calendars as long as circumstances permit. In October 1912, at the Universal Cooperative Time Act Conference in Paris, the unification of the time of the telegraph was approved, and on July 1, 1913, it was decided that it would all be due to Greenwich (non-participation) (Japan did not participate). In 1918, when ships sailing in the ocean (except for chronometers for longitude measurement) used daily to match the local time of the lullaby, which was considered to be the location of the ship at noon every day, this custom was reintroduced in the British commerce department in the sea, and there was a detailed opinion about whether it was possible to adopt a time system similar to the standard time adopted by many countries at that time on land. In October and November 1926, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) and the International Geodetic and Geophysics Union (IUGG) hosted a universal longitude observation (Japan also participated), in which radio telegraph transmitted Greenwich mean time in the same format as the International Bureau of News and Time (BIH, present-day IERS) academic time, and compared the longitude by measuring the time difference. Thus, from the 19th century to the 1920s, Greenwich Average Time was achieved as a reference time that did not depend on the world's common longitude in the fields of calendars, astronomy, timetables, geodesics, etc., other than navigation. The timetable from the Greenwich Observatory was first launched on February 5, 1924. Since the founding of Claudius Ptolemy, astronomers have used \"astronomical time\" at noon at the beginning of the day. This was to avoid the inconvenience of changing the date during night observation. However, in 1917, sailors in the United Kingdom argued that the astronomical time described in the nautical calendar should be abolished and used on a daily basis.",

Greenwich Average Time was once adopted as an international standard time, and Standard Time was used as a standard in the UK and other parts of the world. Note that the current international reference time is an annotation 2 that uses the Agreement World Time (UTC) that corrects the concept. ) Due to this, UTC and GMT are sometimes considered to be approximately identical. The terms \"G.M.T.\" and \"Zulu\" are generally synonymous with UTC in the field of navigation and communication. GMT is also used to mean UTC for laws, communications, consumer use, and other purposes where the maximum accuracy of time is integer seconds. GMT, on the other hand, continues to be used in the sense of UT1 in the world time as the independent argument of the calendar in the celestial navigation and survey. However, GMT is replaced by an appropriate name (UTC, UT1 or UT). Greenwich mean time is the mean solar time at the Greenwich Observatory in London, England, traditionally defined as 0 degrees longitude. When the British Empire developed as a shipping nation, the Longitude Act was enacted in 1714, and longitude discovery methods at sea were actively studied. In 1761, Harrison developed a chronometer resistant to temperature and oscillation. When Neville Masquerin was appointed director of the Greenwich Observatory in 1765, he immediately began compiling a one-year nautical calendar for navigation, and in 1766 the first nautical calendar of the following year was published by the Board of Longitude Discovery in the Sea. The British crew then adapted their watches to the Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) to calculate the current longitude difference from the Greenwich meridian during the voyage. However, the time of the sun on the ship was used as usual for the clock used for ordinary daily life on the ship. This custom was combined with Neville Masquerin's lunar eclipse (a method of determining longitude from the stellar position of the celestial body in the nautical calendar and the observed position of the moon on the ship) used in other countries' ships, and GMT eventually came to be used as a reference time independent of the world's common longitude in the sea area.",

At the end of September, he left the team silently and returned home, spending several days at home because his hands were hurting.

In response to the allied invasion of the empire, which led to the Battle of Amlitza in the same year, he was promoted to general with Mittermeyer.

However, after the end of the Toyotomi family, the Momoyama culture changed due to the stability of society, and on the other hand, it increased the degree of sophistication and created a few yoseya architecture such as Katsura Imperial Villa, while on the other hand, the baroque trend of competing for luxury such as Nikko Toshogu Shrine and samurai Goten increased. Nobunaga ODA's power gradually grew stronger among Sengoku daimyo (Japanese territorial lord in the Sengoku period), and after he went to Kyoto with Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA, Nobunaga took advantage of the authority of the Emperor and the shogun of the Muromachi bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) to control the Kinai region and the Tokai region. He carried out military reforms that changed the weapons of military and agricultural separation and main combat activities from Yumiya to guns. Economic policies such as Rakuichi, Rakuza, the abolition of Sekisho, the rule of autonomous cities such as Sakai, and the Sosenrei were implemented. When Nobunaga expelled Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA from Kyoto in 1573, the Muromachi bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) practically collapsed and the Oda government was established.

In particular, the second half when the Toyotomi family took control of the whole country was called the Momoyama period, and the culture prospered mainly during this period was called the Momoyama culture. However, Momoyama was named after the fact that peach trees were planted at the ruins of Fushimi-jo Castle, which had been abandoned in the Edo period, and it became called 'Momoyama' since the publication of \"Fushimikan\" in 1868, and it does not mean that there was a castle called Momoyama-jo Castle. Because of the period between the Oda government and the Toyotomi government, the term \"Oritoyo period\" was also widely used. There are also intellectuals who propose the names of the Azuchi-Osaka period, the Tensho period, and the Osaka period. Needless to say, the Osaka-jo Castle was also shorter than Fushimi-jo Castle because it was necessary to serve the Imperial Court after Hideyoshi assumed the post of Kanpaku (chief adviser to the Emperor), and since it had been located in Kyoto since 1587, Hideyoshi was actually in Osaka-jo Castle. There are several views at the beginning and end of the Azuchi-Momoyama period. It is also thought that the first year was 1568, when Nobunaga ODA went to Kyoto with Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA, and 1573, when Yoshiaki was expelled from Kyoto and the Muromachi bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) was virtually destroyed, and 1576, when the construction of Azuchi-jo Castle began.

In the history of art, it is generally called the Azuchi-Momoyama period until the fall of the Toyotomi family in 1615, and in particular, 'Momoyama culture' and 'Momoyama art' are classified into periods from the middle of Tensho period, where Hideyoshi held the supremacy, to the end of the Keicho period.",

In Japan, until around 1970, Shinjuku was the birthplace of the popularity of \"young people's town\" and \"young people's culture.\" However, in 1969, due to the 'Shinjuku Nishiguchi fork guerrilla incident' in which a large number of arrests occurred due to a collision between young people and riot police forcefully disbanded an unauthorized folk song rally held at the Nishiguchi underground plaza at Shinjuku Station as an anti-war campaign against the Vietnam War, it became difficult for young people to gather in Shinjuku, and Shinjuku was avoided by young people at the same time. On the other hand, PARCO was opened in Shibuya in 1973, and the history of young people's culture in Japan has changed greatly as 'Kuyakusho-dori Street' from Shibuya Station to Shibuya Ward Hall and Shibuya Public Hall was renamed 'Shibuya Park Street' and redevelopment was carried out. The flow changed from 'Shinjuku to Shibuya or to the whole of Shibuya Ward' (i.e., the direction of Harajuku, Omotesando, Daikanzan, and Uraharajuku). This was also a transformation from a politically strong counterculture (see 1960s counterculture) to a mercantile subculture. There is a history that the former Sezon Group (Seibu Distribution Group) and the Tokyu Group developed Shibuya competitively and developed into a large-scale downtown area as it is today (see below). As of 2020, many commercial, office and cultural facilities of the Tokyu Group, such as Shibuya 109, Tokyu Department Store head office, Bunkamura, Shibuya Scramble Square, and Shibuya Stream, have gathered around Shibuya Station, and are commonly called 'Tokyu Village.' One hundred shops in the Maruyama-cho and Dogenzaka areas, which are a little away from the station, used to be a flower town, and now it is a hotel town and a entertainment area where there is a mix of love hotels, restaurants, and live houses. On the other hand, the Matsutake district next to Maruyama-cho and Dogenzaka is known as a luxury residential area. Every year on October 31 and the weekend just before, many young people dressed in costumes gather at the scramble intersection and are famous as the sacred and center of Halloween in Japan.",

Along with Shinjuku and Ikebukuro, it is one of the three major suburban centers of the mountain hand, and is one of Japan's busiest districts centered around Shibuya Station. A large-scale downtown area spreads mainly in the direction of Center Street on the northwest side of Shibuya Station. Known as 'the city of youth,' it is known as 'Seibu Department Store,' 'Tokyu Department Store,' 'Shibuya Parco,' '109,' 'Shibuya Scramble Square,' 'Miyashita Park (Shibuya Ward Miyashita Park),' and other department stores, fashion buildings, specialty stores, restaurants, etc. In front of Shibuya Station, there is a bronze statue of Hachi no Kimi, who is a famous meeting place, and just across the street is the Shibuya Scramble intersection. The Shibuya Scramble Crossing is proud of its world-renowned reputation and attracts many tourists from Japan and abroad. Crossing the scramble intersection from the station is Shibuya Center Street, where restaurants and game centers are concentrated. It was once a pedestrian paradise, but was abolished on December 28, 2002. In addition, Shibuya Station serves as one of Tokyo's most important terminal stations, and has about 3.3 million users, including direct passengers, and is the second-largest station in the world after Shinjuku Station. When Shibuya Station opened as a station of the Nippon Railway in 1885, the surrounding area was a rural station in the suburbs of Tokyo, so the number of users was very small at the time of its opening. After that, several railway lines and streetcars (Tokyo City Trams and Gyokuden) entered the station, and it developed as a terminal station in the southwestern suburbs of Tokyo City. In the wake of the Great Kanto Earthquake in 1923, the number of people moving from Shimomachi, which was heavily damaged, to the suburban area of Yamanote increased, and the number of users of Shibuya Station also increased. Before the war, the present-day Tokyu (former Tokyo Express Railway) established the Toyo Department Store (later the Toyo Store of Tokyu Department Store), the terminal department store directly connected to the Kanto Station, and so on. However, in Shibuya, the street spread radially, and it was difficult to expand the road because there were many ski slopes and one-way roads, and due to the various circumstances, the developers were estranged, and as a result, the development of the town was delayed compared with the busy towns of Yamanote such as Shinjuku and Ikebukuro.",

He was also responsible for governing various daimyo (Japanese feudal lords) and promoted the shogun's order to the daimyo (Japanese feudal lord) in Roju hosho (a letter of service to the shogun). Some of them were called Tetsuji Roju (members of shogun's council of elders) who were in charge of reconciliation and guidance in advance between daimyo (Japanese feudal lord) and bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun). Although the shogun is regarded as the prime minister and the roju is regarded as the minister, as mentioned above, it is actually quite different. Roju was in charge of government affairs in general, and he was in charge of monthly shifts or consultations, and he did not divide government affairs like current ministers. Under the system of the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), the division of political affairs was carried out at each magistrate's level. However, later, one of them was appointed to the position of Kattegakari Roju, also known as Roju shuza (the head of Roju), and he carried out politics as the head of Roju (member of shogun's council of elders). In addition, he sometimes set up a maruroju (member of shogun's council of elders) in the west. The Nishinomaru Roju was not involved in the shogunate government, but was mainly responsible for the family affairs of the Ogosho (the Imperial Palace) and the Shogun's lions who lived in Nishinomaru. In 1867, the Tsukiban system was abolished due to the reform of the shogunate government at the end of the Edo period, and the five governors of domestic affairs, accounting, foreign affairs, the Army, and the Navy were appointed exclusively, and government affairs were divided like the current ministers. It is said that the work hours were about four hours. In general, roju (member of shogun's council of elders) visited Edo-jo Castle around 10 a.m. and left around 2 p.m. When he assumed the position of roju (member of shogun's council of elders), he often changed his residence to Nishinomarushita (present-day Imperial Palace Gaiju). Because many daimyo families around the Kanto region assumed important positions in the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) such as roju (member of shogun's council of elders) because they were often packed in Edo-jo Castle, many daimyo in remote provinces were transferred to places closer to Edo such as the Sakura Domain in Shimousa Province when they assumed roju (member of shogun's council of elders). Conversely, it became difficult to attend the shogunate government, especially as roju (member of shogun's council of elders) in the case of Enkoku. Because of this, Tadakuni MIZUNO, the lord of the Hizen Karatsu Domain, who had a strong desire to succeed in the cabinet of the Tokugawa shogunate, drastically reduced the actual income from Karatsu, but he planned to relocate to the Hamamatsu Domain in Totomi Province, which was closer to Edo, and he became a roju (member of shogun's council of elders) in the cabinet of the Tokugawa shogunate. In order to become roju (member of shogun's council of elders), there was a rule that it was usually a fudai daimyo with 50,000 koku or more.",

        "paragraph": "Witches were people who were subordinate to demons, and their contracts with demons and sexual intercourse were considered to have given them supernatural magical powers and ointments that harm people. In the 16th and 17th centuries, when witch trials were held actively, the view of witches spread mainly among literati in modern European society. Since the late 20th century in Europe and the United States, more and more people have self-regulated themselves as witches. Many of them are followers of the Wicca, the witch religious movement started by Gerald Gardner in the mid-20th century, as well as the neo-Anthropological Witchcraft. Wicca believers dislike the bad image of the word \"witch\" and are called \"wiccans\". The Witchcraft schools of Wicca and other Neo-Anthropologists are also called the Witch Sect or the Witch Art in Japan. In European countries from the 15th to the 17th century, many people were accused of witchcraft and were dismissed by secular and religious trials. At the time, witches were given special power to interact with demons, and believed to bring bad weather and harm humans and livestock. In particular, there were not only women, but also male witches, both of whom were represented by the same word in English. A theory emerged in the 19th century that the witch was made up of sacred judges and ecclesiastical scholars. However, there is a theory that some of the witches practiced some form of pagan or xenophobic ritual. Among the books that denounce witches written in the 15th century, \"The Witch's Witch\" (1486/7), written by the German Inquisitionary, is especially famous as a guide to witch hunting. The book was widely read in European countries in the wake of the printing revolution of the 15th century, and is said to have contributed to the full-fledged witch trials in Germany. However, the relationship between the book and the intensification of witch hunting is not clear because witch hunting was in full swing a century after the book was published. During the 16th and 17th centuries, when witch-hunting was in its infancy, a number of demonic books were published, including Jean Bodan's The Wicked Devil of 1580.",

Modern anthropology sometimes applies the concept of shamanism to the magic of non-European countries, but it has been pointed out that there are aspects of shamanism in European witches and magic. In the cave mural of the Paleolithic period, the figure of a person who is interpreted as a magician or a broad sense of 'Shaman' is depicted, and it is thought that the magic is an old act together with a person who dates back to before history. In the view of witches in the era of witch-hunting, according to existing sources, witches were often women and sometimes men. In modern European languages, there is also the word sorcier (German: Hexer, Hexenmeister), but the term \"magic\" is not widely used in Japanese, and the term \"magic\" is sometimes used in male-shaped sorciers. He gave the general definition of the witch at the beginning, but it is difficult to show the maximum common-command definition that applies to all. Witches in European history have become a multilayered concept with complex backgrounds, with multifaceted witch statues. From archaic witches and wizards in the ancient and medieval periods to ephemeral witches formulated by witches in the late Middle Ages and spread throughout the literacy, folklore of the early-modern times and witches in Melgen, romantic witches from the 19th century onwards, and neo-Anthropological witches from the 20th century onwards, the term is used to describe witches. One of the elements of the witch's concept is the concept of persecution magic, known in Latin as \"marefikium\" (bad behavior). Injuring others by magic means was the subject of punishment from the ancient Roman times. In medieval Europe, this idea of malefichium survived. However, in the 15th century in the latter half of the medieval period, the concept of 'the existence that makes a disaster with the power obtained by contracting with the devil' was born, which was different from just a bad magician until then.",

External science is a fundamental discipline that encompasses all disciplines using surgical methods. In contrast, there is internal science. The idea of cutting the body and treating the affected area has existed for a long time. Examples of evidence are the puncture marks found in 5-10% of the skull of the Stone Age found in Europe, Siberia, China, and North and South America. Roman surgery In Europe and the United States around the 16th century, medicine was predominantly internal sciences, and barbershops performed surgical procedures. As a remnant of that period, the red, blue, and white signs (sign poles) of barbershops are said to mean arteries, veins, and bandages. In Oriental medicine, \"Shurei,\" which described various systems of the Zhou period, held the post of sigma medicine, which dealt with swellings and wounds on the surface of the body. In the 14th century, the differentiation of internal medicine and surgery was confirmed, but it was based only on the difference in the affected area, and the full-scale differentiation was inspired by the introduction of Nanko medicine. In English, \"physician\" is still the name of the clinician, and it is often classified as \"physician\" and \"surgeon\". Since the 19th century, the anesthesia law has been established, and it has developed rapidly in the development of postwar cardiopulmonary arthroplasty. In Japan, the term surgery was first used in \"Taiheiki\" (The Record of the Great Peace). It came to be used frequently in the Muromachi period, and the term for the outer border of synonyms came to be seen. In \"Irohajiki,\" a Japanese dictionary written in 1559, he described 'gekikyosha' as a surgeon. In the mid-16th century, a surgeon called Kim Jong-un appeared to surgically treat wounds in the battlefield. In the Edo period, kinpu developed, and merging with the medicine of Nanto, and as long as it remains in the record, the world's oldest general anesthesia surgery was successfully performed, such as Aobu KAOKA.",

In the 1880s, the Qing dynasty built a battery on the northern shore of Dalian Bay, and the city began to form. In 1898, after the Sino-Japanese War, Russia, which had the right to lease the tip of the Liaodong Peninsula, was given the title of 'Darney' (\"far away\") in return for the relief of Qing Province by the interference of the Three Kingdoms.

However, the Russo-Japanese War, which broke out in 1904, ended with Japan's superiority, and by the 1905 Treaty of Portsmouth after the war, the debts at the tip of the Liaodong Peninsula moved from Russia to Japan. In Japan, 'Dairen' was adopted as the city name from the place name 'Dairen Bay' of the Qing dynasty. This is due to the similar pronunciation of the Russian name Darney. During the Russian era, the construction of the railway was completed, and the port was under maintenance, and the population was about 40,000, with the streets and some buildings near the railroad's port being built. In order to develop Dalian as a trading city, the Japanese government extended its port facilities by continuing to develop infrastructure for the Kanto Totokufu and Nanmanshu Railways.

It is also famous not only for Brazil but also for being one of the world's leading tourist destinations, as well as for the music city that produced Shoro and Bosanava. It consists of two continents, a slightly inclined, parallel tetrahedral shape, and an island in Guanabara Bay, with a length of about 70 km east-west and 37 km north-south. Officially, it consists of seven large administrative districts, 33 small areas, and 160 town districts, Bairro, but is characterized by the absence of District Distrito at the top of the township. Typically, it is divided into Centro, Southern, Northern, Bara da Chijuka, and Western regions. In January 1502, Portuguese explorer Gaspard de Lemos arrived in the area at the mouth of Guanabara Bay. Guanabara Bay was mistaken for being a large river due to its narrow bay entrance, and named \"the January River\" in Portuguese after the discovered month. The Portuguese built a house with white walls on the coast and lived there. The native Tupi called their whites \"Kali Oka\" (meaning \"white house\" in Tupi Guarani). This is the origin of the modern word Carioca. In 1555, French colonists created the Antarctic French Reservation, which the Portuguese expelled in 1567 and built a small community there until the 18th century. The name of the town is the transfer of the name of the river (actually the bay). Until the 17th century, Rio was only a small port town with sugar cultivation and sugar mills. In the first half of the 18th century, however, gold mines were found around Minas Gerais inland. The gold scattering site was originally S\u00e3o Paulo, the base of the gold-mining discoverers Bandeiantes, but in 1725, when a new road between Rio and Minas Gerais was opened, S\u00e3o Paulo was replaced by a port of gold and diamond in Minas, and became the center of transportation and wealth in the Brazilian Colony. This led to the transfer of the center of gravity from the thriving northeast to the southeast, and in 1763, the governor of Brazil was transferred from Salvador da Bahia to Rio, becoming the capital of the Brazilian Colony.",

In Islam, Jesus himself is regarded as a prophet, an apostle of God (Alaf) prior to the prophet Muhammad, and as a Messiah sent by God. According to Kruern's account, \"Masuyev\" (messiah) appears from the descendants of David, who saves people from suffering and establishes the rule of Allahu (God). At the end of the year, he appeared as an agent of God and subjugated the fake Messiah, which was inherited from the Jewish and Christian statue of Messiah. In Islam, \"masuyf\" is the savior of mankind, while what appears before him in front of people is called \"mahdi\" (meaning \"the right guide\"). He refers to Abouhanifer unlike Jesus. When simply called al-Mas or \u0645\u064a \u0627\u0644 Mas All\u0101h, the name refers to Jesus himself. As \"Ether\" means him, and as the last to the second Messiah, Kruern positions Jesus. Along with Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Muhammad, in Islamic tradition, Jesus is one of the most important prophets in Islam: the Qur'an 1]Kur'an 2]Kur'an 3], but unlike Christian understanding, Muslims only understand him as a prophet, not a God. Prophecy in human form is sufficient in Islam, and does not mean the true power of God as Jesus does in Christianity. The Quran states that Ether is the son of Mariam (Isaibn Maryam, Arabic) and is a Messiah and prophet sent to Israel's descendants. The birth of Esther is explicitly described in 19 chapters 1\u201333 of the Kur'an, and in 4 chapters 171 of the Kur'an 6 as the son of Marjam.

The Exodus states that the priest and the king were oiled at the time of his inauguration. Later, it began to refer to the ruler to do the ideal rule, and to the divine bailout. The Greek translation of Messiah is \u03c1\u03c3 (\u03c1\u03c3), and \"Christ\" is written in Japanese. Christians believe that Jesus of Nazareth is the Messiah. When Jesus is recognized as Messiah, his name is Jesus Christ. Muslims also refer to Jesus as Messiah, but it differs from Christianity. The Hebrew Masiaja became Messiah (\u03bc\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1) in Greek. The Japanese Messiah comes from Messiah. Messiah is an English word derived from the same word. In Hebrew, the word \"mashiach\" means \"detached oil\" in direct translation, and refers to the separation of someone or something by holy oil. The word \"messiah\" is found throughout the Old Testament and is used for a variety of people and things such as Jewish kings, rabbis, prophets, altars, and unfermented bread. The subject is not necessarily a Jewish or Jewish society, but in the Isaiah book, Cyrus II of the Achaemenids is referred to as Messiah. In Judaism, the concept of Messiah was born of the descendants of David, who rebuilt Israel, restored the kingdom of David, and brought peace to the world. Believing in the arrival of Messiah is an important part of Judaism's faith, including in the 13 articles of faith by Mymonides. Those who called themselves Messiah in each period (which means \"false Messiah\" from conservatives and the majority) were naturally divided within Judaism and formed a denomination. There was also a Christian Muslim (Muslim) who supported this. And, of course, Jesus is seen by Judaism as a false messiah. Some sects, such as Messianic Judaiism, call themselves Judaism and recognize Jesus as Messiah while practicing Judaism-style liturgy, but they are often recognized by both mainstream Judaism and Christianity as a part of Christianity, not as a part of Judaism.",

Although Super Saturday is not an official holiday in the United States, it is classified as a group of other well-known shopping days, such as Black Friday, Small Business Saturday, and Cyber Monday. In the United States, Super-Saturday typically accounts for about $15 billion in retail sales. In order to win each other's competition, stores significantly discount and sell their products. It also extends business hours to attract customers and promote impulse purchases. In the United States, Super Saturday accounts for a significant portion of retail holiday sales. According to a 2006 survey, sales from December 21 to 24 accounted for 13.6% of holiday sales. In addition, some companies make up 60 percent of their sales on Super Saturday. To attract customers, stores often extend their opening hours on these important days of the retail season. Some stores continue to operate throughout the day until Christmas Eve. When there are few customers in the store, they want to have plenty of time and distribute the workload of cashiers. Many stores are increasing staff on these important days in order to meet demand, as stores expect to double or triple the exposure of typical customers on super-satdays. Because there is demand for shoppers, this day usually makes a lot of money for retailers. According to a 2009 report, by mid-December, more than half of all U.

        "paragraph": "The world economy is a division of economic activity from a unified perspective. It is a broader concept than the international economy, which focuses on transactions between the national economy. In addition, the markets of each country that are linked in the world economy are sometimes collectively called the world market. As in modern times, in a situation where the currency is not integrated, the basic economic unit becomes the currency sphere (most often the national economic sphere). However, with the progress of globalization, the international economy has developed, and the national economy of each country has strengthened the linkage. In this way, it is called the world economy because it is linked like a single economic zone. The national economic trends of each country are not necessarily consistent with the global economic trends. This is because the global economy does not have a much wider framework, resulting in a misconception of synthesis. For example, if a country strives to increase its trade balance and succeeds, the trade balance will be positive, but not all countries in the world will be able to make the trade balance positive at the same time. This is because the trade deficit of one country means the trade deficit of several countries in the world. In addition, economic growth in each country is not limited to a level, and some countries achieve an economic growth rate that exceeds the global economic growth rate. Such countries gather expectations as \"the locomotive of the world economy\". Shortly after the birth of the commodity economy in the west and east of the Eurasian continent, these economies began to connect with each other. The trade between the east and west was narrow at first, but gradually expanded. The world economy in the Eurasian world was born when the Mongol Empire established an extensive version that connects the east and west of the Eurasian continent. After the fall of the Mongol Empire, east-west trade flourished on the Eurasian continent. After the Great Sea Age, the economy began to be reorganized around Europe. At first, Africa, South Asia, and North and South America connected with Europe, and the trade network increased the linkage of each country's economy, resulting in the birth of a new world economy. Since the Industrial Revolution, the booming European economy has taken over East Asia in the mid-19th century, and the genealogy of the modern-day world economy has begun. Industry and finance were organically combined under an international financial system based in London, England, to form a global economy based on a free market economy.",

At the end of the Edo period, the translation of the English word \"Religion\" was required, and the term \"religion\" was adopted as a general term, and it is said that it spread in the early Meiji period. Religion was accepted as an image of Christianity and greatly influenced the image of Japanese religion. The original English word Religion is derived from the Latin word religio. Religio is a combination of the prefix \"re-\" and \"binding\" ligare, which means \"binding again\", from which it was understood that \"binding God and man again\". The first translation of the word Religion was in the Treaty of Amity and Commerce (1858) between Japan and the United States, and the translation of the word 'Soji' and 'Soho.' Other translations that followed from the end of the Edo period to the beginning of the Meiji period include 'Religion,' 'Somon,' 'Soshi Hokyo,' 'Hokyo,' 'kyomon,' 'Shinto,' and 'Shodo.' Among them, words containing religious practices such as 'Soshi' and 'Somon' were more widely used than words with strong meanings of thought and doctrine, such as 'Tokuho' and 'Shodo,' which corresponded to the fact that religion was deeply associated with practice for many Japanese. Although the word 'religion' has a stronger meaning of doctrine than practice, it is said that such translations eventually became established in the context of diplomacy in the process of westernization of Japan and Westernization of the values of elites and intellectuals. The term \"religion\" is believed to have been adopted from the translation of Religions\u00fcbung, which was included in Article 4 of the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between the Northern German Federation in 1869. It is also said that the word 'religion' came to be used by many Japanese in the sense of 'religious general' as it is today when it was published in the dictionary \"Revised Enhancement Philosophy of Philosophy\" (Tetsujiro INOUE) published in 1884.",

Religion that is believed only in certain regions and ethnic groups, such as Judaism, Shinto and Hinduism, is called ethnic religion.

In addition to pointing out in the mouth, Tsukkomi sometimes replaces the body of a bokke by slapping (dock) with a flat hand, an instep of a hand, or a small tool, or by kicking it with a leg. According to Atsutane AKIDA's bibliography, when Engo TAMAGOYA sang \"Soga Monogatari\" (The Tale of Soga), Tsukkomi's interaction with the drum tataki of the daiyaku was the beginning of Tsukkomi. The role of boke and tsukkomi is not always fixed, and there are some combinations where boke and tsukkomi are replaced by nature by flow. For example, in response to jokes about the role of Boke, the role of Tsukkomi is called 'noru,' i.e., a performance in which the role of Tsukkomi is temporarily sympathized with Boke, and after a certain amount of nokomi is put in the role of Tsukkomi, it is noritsukkomi. Therefore, it is reasonable to think that Boke and Tsukkomi conceptualized the way of interaction rather than 'playing a role.' In trio manzai (if the role is fixed), the ratio of two boke and one tsukkomi is the mainstream. Depending on the role of the neta, it is sometimes distinguished from 'small boke' for a small bokeh, which corresponds to fris (described later), and 'big boke' for a person who performs a large bokeh that reaches Ochi. In conjunction with the above-mentioned roles, one of the members must play the role of advancing, deploying, and converting the composition of the medium, called 'mush-fri' or 'fri.' The term 'tsukkomi' in \"Daijisen\" states that 'it is a manzai, and it is mainly a role to advance the story against the blur,' and it is defined that Tsukkomi takes charge of the frisbee, but there are many combinations where Bokke takes charge of the frisbee. If Boke and Tsukkomi assume fixed combinations, three kinds of combinations may be conceived: one in which the tsukkomi progresses, the other in which the tsukkomi progresses, and the other in which both the boke and the tsukkomi progress. In his book, Isami MAEDA classified manzai into the following four types and ten types. Manzai-shi's geisha and etiquette combine or combine these ten elements into one or the other.

Design design in architecture is an area that determines the shape and material of buildings mainly from an artistic point of view, and in consideration of the functions required in structures and facilities, we lead the decision of the overall structure and shape policy, design it to combine the aesthetics and functions required by society and the host, and create design books (architecture drawings). In recent years, there has been a tendency to preserve architectural architecture in the form of architectural photographs after completion. Architectural structure design refers to the design of foundational diagrams, structural calculations, and other architectural structures specified by the Ordinance of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism. The field of design is designed so that buildings do not collapse due to their own weight, loading load, earthquake, wind, snow, and other external forces. In cooperation with a design representative, a structural plan is established so that the design property has the necessary strength in the structure, and the structure calculation is actually carried out to verify it, but in buildings that require large-scale space such as skyscrapers and gymnasiums, and buildings with complex shapes, it can be dominant in overall design. Equipment design refers to the design of architectural facilities (architecture equipment prescribed in Article 2, item (iii) of the Building Standards Act) in floor plan diagrams, structural details, and other design books. Based on building laws and regulations, architectural environment engineering, air conditioning, ventilation, hygiene, communication, smoke evacuation equipment, and the specification of lifting equipment considering barrier-free, the planning and design of the matters related to the building equipment will be carried out and decided. The field of disaster prevention planning and evacuation planning to ensure the safety of users of buildings. In particular, it is closely related to evacuation regulations and firefighting laws under the Building Standards Act.",

The original term \"architecture\" refers to the act of building buildings (processes, techniques) rather than individual buildings. When referring to an individual building, it should be called a \"building\", but in fact it is often confused and used. Others think that artistic works should be called architecture, but this also has nothing to do with the distinction between \"Architecture\" and \"Building\". According to the oldest existing architectural thesis, \"Architectural Books\" (also referred to as \"Architectural Theory\" or \"Architectural Ten Books\"), written by the Roman architect Witruvius, it is necessary to combine utilitas, firmitas, and venustas, and it is considered to be an artistic and scientific point of view in order to achieve this. It is involved in the construction of a comprehensive environmental design, such as regional planning, urban planning, and landscape design, and the formation of a community, as well as the creation of interior decorations such as exterior walls, openings, interior furniture, and small items. However, it is usually taken as a unit of land. According to Article 2, item (13) of the Act on Building Standards, which is one of the laws related to architecture in Japan, it is defined as 'to newly build, increase, remodel, or relocate buildings.' The term \"architecture\" (architecture) was translated as \"architecture\" in the early Meiji period, and the term \"architecture\" was used in the sense of \"architecture\", but the word \"architecture\" was used in the sense of \"architecture\" today in the English-Japanese dictionary of the Meiji period. The institutional magazine of the Architectural Society (currently the Japan Architectural Society) was 'Architectural Journal' (originated in 1887). In a paper published in 1894, Tadata ITO argued that the term 'architecture' was appropriate as a term that expresses the attributes of general art rather than engineering.",

        "paragraph": "In this paper, we mainly describe it in the human world. The Japanese word \"world\" has a history of coming to Japan as a Chinese language through China from India. The origin of Sanskrit is Loka-dhaatu. \"loka\" meant something like \"space\", \"a place without trees\" or \"vacant land\". \"dhaatu\" means \"world\". The word \"loka-dhaatu\" has a history of being used as a Buddhist term, meaning \"a space in which a living thing survives and revolves, in which a Buddha spreads his teachings\". When Sanskrit was translated into Chinese, it became a world. The word 'world' focuses on the idea of time, the word 'world' focuses on space, and 'world' is a translation that takes into account both time and space. One sutra states that the world consists of the east, west, north, south and south, and the world is the third generation of the past, present, and future. In China, the term 'world' was originally used as a Buddhist term, but it gradually became used in the field of poetry (especially in Chinese poetry) to mean 'the world' or 'the world.' The term 'world' is used in \"Taketori Monogatari\" (The Tale of Taketori) and the like in the sense of 'the world' and 'the world.' Looking at the West, the word \"kosmos\" was used in ancient Greek, meaning \"world\", but also \"beautiful decoration\" and \"order\". In other words, while contrasting with the concept of \"chaos\", it meant \"a world with a beautiful order\". Thus, from Greece to the West, it seems that the concept of the world was more focused on the aspects associated with order. In \"The Gospel of John,\" it is said that 'the word was in the cosmos. The world was made up of words, but the world did not accept words.' The first two \"cosmos\" refer to a world created by God and which has a divine order, and the third \"world\" refers to a world that has been given order by human beings.",

In practical terms, the term \"world\" is often used in many senses, although it often refers to the entire physical domain in which mankind is constantly active (such as \"worldly bonds\" and \"worldly worlds\"). It is a pluralistic term that mainly means space related to some kind of society. It is often used as a social, political, economic or human geographical concept associated with human beings. In 'social' which is a synonym, the focus is on groups and communities, and it is associated with interpersonal relationships such as relatives. The term 'world' is often used today as a concept of space (because the scope of people's activities has expanded), but 'the earth' does not include much meaning in Japanese as a place of human activity, and is often used as an object or physical space from the perspective of natural sciences. In the future, if the constant activity of mankind spreads to the universe, the physical area included in the \"world\" may be extended to space and other planets. The cohesive way of thinking about the world and the way humans are in the world is called the \"worldview\". It also partially overlaps with the view of life, but refers to a wider range than the view of life, and possibly includes emotional appraisal, as well as life. Unlike the world view, \"World Image\" is an attitude that looks at the world from the outside, where the world is only an object of intellectual and objective analysis. However, the world image is often verified according to the times, breaking down the traditional view of the world, and becoming the intellectual foundation of a new view of the world. In other words, a world view is a way of thinking that is based on the life experience and traditional ideas of people living in various parts of the world of each era, and is a guideline for each person's way of life and behavior by merging with the world image as an intellectual system. Although it is often used to refer to physical, social, and psychological areas in which individuals and groups in the human world belong or operate, it can also be used for non-human organisms or for areas of non-biological or abstract events.",

Nakatomi (Middle vassal) of Dazai no Kanzuka, Noriyoshi Ajamaro, told Usa-jingu Shrine that if Dokyo were taken to the Emperor's rank, there was a Shinto deity that the whole country would be in peace. However, after WAKE no Kiyomaro visited Usa-jingu Shrine as an Imperial envoy, Dokyo did not get the Imperial Throne because he appealed that this Shinto shrine was false. When Emperor Shotoku passed away in 770, Dokyo asked for a coffin and protected the Imperial mausoleum of Emperor Shotoku even after the funeral, but on August 21, 770, he was ordered to become the betto of Shimotsuke Yakushi-ji Temple (Shimono Province), and went down to Shimotsuke Province. The news of Dokyo's death was reported to Emperor Konin from Shimotsuke Province on May 13, 772. Although Dokyo was not punished for his many years of service, four of his relatives (his younger brother, Teruhito YUKAKI, and his sons, Hirokata, Hirota, and Hirotsu) were captured and exiled to Tosa Province. (The above 'Shoku Nihongi' (Chronicle of Japan Continued)) In the precincts of Ryuko-ji Temple (Shimono City, Tochigi Prefecture), there is a mound that is said to be the grave of Dokyo. Because he was favored by Emperor Koken, there was a theory that he had a relationship with the Emperor and a theory that he had a big root. It is often used as a material for a collection of anecdotes such as \"Nihon Ryoiki\" (The Diary of Japanese Spirits) and \"Kojidan\" (The Tale of Ancient Matters). However, these materials began to be chanted after the Heian period, and there is no reliable primary historical material. In the Edo period, a senryu called 'Dokyo is made to have three knees,' 'Dokyo is made to die, and Mitonori' and 'Dokyo is made to have roots.' In addition, the species of beetle that lives in the mountains of Osaka and Nara has a very large junction in comparison with the length of the body, so it is called 'Dokyo-osumishi' after Dokyo's theory of a great root. Kiyoyuki TSUJIGUCHI said that this theory was established because 'Dokyo' and 'Dokyo' were confused and tied to Doso no kami. At Yuge-jinja Shrine in Kumamoto City, there is a folklore that 'After Dokyo lost his position, he visited this place, where he became a married couple for the first time when he saw a fair and gorgeous woman named Fujiko-hime, and Dokyo Hoshi, known for her dedication to the hospitality of Princess Fujiko, had a peaceful life as a good husband.'",

His secular family name was Yuge clan (Yuge no Muraji), and there is a genealogy that says he was a son of Yuge no Otomaro. He was also called Yuge no Dokyo from his secular surname. Along with TAIRA no Masakado and Takauji ASHIKAGA, he is sometimes referred to as one of the three villains in Japan. The Yuge clan was a member of the clan who led the Yuge section that produced the bows. Although there are more than one lineage, it is said that the lineage (Yuge-ren) belonging to Dokyo was a family of the Mononobe clan, and it is said that after Moriya MONONOBE slandered his mother's family name and called himself Yuge-tairen, his descendants called themselves the Yuge clan. In the Senmyo issued by the Retired Emperor Koken in 764, it is said that Dokyo tried to succeed the position of 'daijin' (minister) of his ancestors, so FUJIWARA no Nakamaro told him to dismiss it, but this 'daijin' is thought to refer to Mononobe no kamiya who was in the position of tairen. There is another theory that he was the son of Emperor Tenchi, Prince Shiki. He was born in Wakae County, Kawachi Province (present-day Yao City, Osaka Prefecture) in 700. When he was young, he became a disciple of Gijuku, a high priest of the Hosso sect, and learned Confucianism (Sanskrit) from Ryoben. He was known for his knowledge of Zen, and he was allowed to enter Naidojo (Buddhist hall in the Imperial Palace) and was enthroned as a Zen priest. In 761, when the capital was temporarily moved to Horanomiya in Omi Province to rehabilitate Heijo no miya Palace, he was taken care of by the Retired Emperor Koken (later Emperor Shotoku), who had been suffering from illness. Since Emperor Junnin always expressed his opinion on this, the Retired Emperor Koken and Emperor Junnin were incompatible with each other. In 763, he was appointed to Shosozu instead of Jikun, and in the following year, 764, FUJIWARA no Nakamaro, Daijo-daijin (Grand Minister of State), was deceived in the Rebellion of FUJIWARA no Nakamaro, so Dokyo was appointed to Daijo-daijin Zenji (Grand Minister of State). In the following year, he became a ruler and promoted a policy based on the philosophy of Buddhism.

        "paragraph": "The Turkic origin is suggested to be somewhere between the Trans-Caspian meadows and North East Asia (Manchuria), and there is genetic evidence that the region near South Siberia and Mongolia is the \"original region within Asia\" of the Turkic people. Similarly, several linguists, including Juha Yanhnen, Roger Brench, and Matthew Spriggs, suggest that modern Mongolia was the origin of the early Turkic language. Around the beginning of the 1st millennium BC, extensive contact occurred between the Turks and the Mongols. The cultural traditions shared between the two Eurasian nomadic groups are called Turco-Mongol traditions. The two groups share a similar religious system, Tenglis, and there are many obvious borrowings between the Turkic and Mongolian languages. Although borrowings were bidirectional, today the terminology of the Turkic language constitutes the largest foreign vocabulary in the vocabulary of the Mongolian language. Some vocabulary and extensive type similarities between the Turkic and neighboring Tungus, Mongolian, Korean, and Nisshin languages (previously all thought to be part of the so-called Altai languages) are considered to indicate prehistoric contacts between these groups in recent years. It is also known as the Northeast Asian Language Union. There are also loan terms that indicate that he had contact with Chinese in the time of his native Turkic. Robbeets (etal.2015, etal.2017) stated that the origin of the Turkic language was somewhere in Manchuria, close to the origins of the Mongolian, Tugngus and Korean languages (including the native languages of the Japanese language), and that these languages originated from the common Transeurasian language. The evidence for the Trans-Eurasian language family has also been presented by Nelson et al. 2020 and Li et al. 2020. The earliest document of the Turkic language was a surreptitiary inscription called the Choiren inscription, which was built between 686 and 687 in the period of the Second Sweaty Country, and was written in the Old Turkic (Turk-Roon) script. Other inscriptions remain in various places in the Mongolian highlands. In 745, Uighur, who destroyed the protagonist, inherited the Old Turkic script.",

        "paragraph": "The Turkic language (also known as the Turkic language or Turkic language) is a family of languages spoken throughout Central Asia and throughout the Altai Mountains west of the Mongolian Plateau, from Eastern Europe to northern Asia (Siberia). From the results of historiography, it is thought that the people who speak this Turkic language were from Central Asia and Mongolian plateaus to Siberia. There is a theory that the Turkic and neighboring Mongolian and Tungus languages share some of the characteristics of the language, so many linguists reject the theory, although there is a theory that the Turkic and the Altaiic languages are combined. Although there is no proof of the mutual phylogeny of the Altai languages, the Turkic should be called the Turkic if the Altai languages were to be recognized as the \"Altai languages\" that share the same ancestral language. For this reason, it is often simply called the Turkic language. It is said that in each language group, the commonality between languages is large, and communication is easy. Compared to the vastness of its distribution, the differences between languages are relatively small, and it is possible that the whole Turkic language is regarded as a single language, the Turkic language, and that each language is a dialect of the Turkic language. In particular, the speakers of the three languages (Oguz, Kipchak, and Karruk) have adopted many vocabularies from Arabic and Persian as a result of their acceptance of Islam. Politically, many languages except Turkish are borrowed from Russian. The present Bulgarians used the Slavic Bulgarian language, but their ancestors, the Bulgars, were Turks who spoke the Bulgar language until they came to the Balkan Peninsula. Bulgaria has adopted a number of Turkish vocabulary as a result of its subsequent Ottoman rule. Turkic languages are classified into several groups of words based on characteristics such as phonology. Below is an example of only the main ones of each language. Like in Japanese, it is characterized by vowel harmony, with adverbs and abbreviated word endings attached to the target words and predicates. The order of words in sentences is basically similar to that in Japanese, and many languages are subject-object-predicate.",

In 1197, Tekish was officially approved by the Abbasid Caliphate as a sultan to rule Iraq and Horacean, and was recognized by both himself and others as a successor to the Great Seljuks. Although Holam Shah was originally from Mamluk and had no tribal ties, the military power of the dynasty was heavily dependent on the Turkic nomads around Holam, and the power of the Turkic nomads Kancri and Kipchak north of the Aral Sea played a major role in Tekish's supremacy. One of Tekish's wives, Telken Hatun, was born in Cancri, and her son, Muhammad, succeeded Tekish in 1200 and was enthroned as the seventh Sultan. In the reign of Alaudine Muhammad, Tekish's son, Holam Shah was at its peak. Allauddin repelled the Gol dynasty, which had invaded Hollasan, and conversely took Herat, the home city of Hollasan in the Gol dynasty. The Western Karahan dynasty, which had barely survived under the sovereignty of Kara-Kitai, ordered Alaudine to counterattack Kara-Kitai in exchange for his vassals and attacked Kara-Kitai in 1208. Alauddin was defeated by Kara Kitai and rumored to have killed him in Holaism, but in 1210 he crossed the river Swirl, allied with the Nimans in addition to the Western Calahan dynasty. In 1210 (or 1212), Mar Waller Annaflu, who completely destroyed the Western Calahanate, who refused to serve Holaism, and spread between the Am and Syl rivers, took power and moved the capital to Samarkand.

After defeating the Fars and Azerbaijani Atabek regimes convened by the Abbasid, in 1217, the Abbasid invaded Iraq to oppose almost all of Iran, and the Holam Shah's power developed into a great empire that extended from Central Asia to Western Asia.",

It is also called the Horatian, Huwaratian, and Kolamic. The independent and semi-autonomous Kingdom of Horasm, given the title Horasm Shah in Persian, has continued to rise and fall as the ruler of Horasm even though it has undergone changes in Islam since the introduction of the Arabs, but the term Horasm Shah was commonly used to refer to an independent government from the Seljuk dynasty in the 11th century. The flag is a green moon in Canton, with the rest in black. The Horatian Shah originated from the Turkic Mamluk, Anush Teguin, who served the Seljuk dynasty, who was appointed governor of the Horatian region, which had been Gazna territory until about 1077, about 30 years earlier. After the death of Anush Teggine, his son Kutubuddin Muhammad was appointed governor-general of Holaism by the Serjuque dynasty around 1097, calling himself Holaism Shah. After Muhammad's death, Atosuz, who hereditaryally succeeded Horasm Shah, showed his independence from the Serjuque dynasty around 1135. In 1138, he was defeated by Sultan Sanjar of the Seljuk dynasty, based in Horacean, south of Holaism, and again surrendered to the Seljuk dynasty. At the same time, Athoss was captured by his eldest son, Atorgue, and there is a section in which he called Kara Kita to Central Asia due to the loss of his territory and his son. In 1141, when Sanjar was defeated by Kara Chitai at the Battle of Katwan, he again broke away, and continued to resist and succumb to Sanjar. However, the Holam region was destroyed by the general of Kara-Kitai, Elb's, and he pledged tribute to Kara-Kitai. In 1157, after the dissolution of the Seljuk regime in Horacean after the death of Saint-Jal, Horacem Shah became independent again, but this time he had to become a member of Kara Kitay, who had expanded his power to Central Asia through the Seljuk dynasty.

In 1866, after the invasion of the Choshu army in the Bakucho War (the Second Conquest of Choshu), the Hamada Domain burned Hamada-jo Castle and the lord of the domain, Takehiro MATSUDAIRA, escaped to Matsue-jo Castle. While the feudal retainers of the Hamada Domain were prepared to recover their lands under Matsue-jo Castle, the families of the feudal retainers fled to Mimasaka Province and began evacuating to the territory of about 8,000 koku or more, and segregated them in each village in their territory. After the death of Shogun Iemochi TOKUGAWA in 1866, the war ended, but Hamada was placed under the occupation of the Choshu Domain and could not return. According to the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), the domain was transferred to about 8,000 koku or more of the territory in Mimasaka Province, and more than 800 feudal retainers and their families gathered together. Takeda was assigned to the headquarters of Mototaro FUKUYAMA's residence in Omineya, Satokobun Village, and the provisional office of the domain was located in Kumon, Tsuruta (present-day Tsuruta, Takebe-cho, Kita Ward, Okayama City) and Oto. The bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) provided 20,000 koku of rice stored in Hamada until he returned to Hamada, but in 1867, he was granted 20,000 koku of shoryo (territory) in Mimasaka Province, and he established the domain with a total of 28,000 koku (approximately 8,000 koku) of shoryo (territory). In the Battle of Toba-Fushimi in 1868, he fought with the army of the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun).

It is also known as the Toyoyo Earthquake or the Toyoyo Earthquake. The source of the earthquake is a little closer to Oita Prefecture in the Toyoyo Strait, which is located between present-day Oita Prefecture in Kyushu and Ehime Prefecture in Shikoku, and it is considered to be one of the in-plate earthquakes originating from the area from Aki-toge Pass through Iyo-toge Pass to Bungo-sui. Immediately before the earthquake, the Ansei-Tokai Earthquake (M8.4) on December 23 and the Ansei-Nankai Earthquake (M8.4) on December 24 occurred one after another. This earthquake occurred about 40 hours after the Nankai earthquake and felt stronger than the Nankai earthquake in Buzen. The river horn (1951) gives the scale MK = 4.3, and the magnitude is converted to M = 7.0. Usami (2003) estimates that M = 7.3-7.5. Ancient records of the earthquake are recorded along with the Tokai and Nankai earthquakes. Yoshida (according to \"Akamatsu family document\") in Iyo Province, Uwajima (according to \"Seismological Chronicles of Japan\"), Saeki (according to \"Goyo Nikki\") in Bungo Province, Nobeoka (according to \"Nikki\") and Ogura (according to \"Suzuki Daizoshu\") in Buzen Province recorded that it was even more intense than the earthquake of the 5th. The Nankai Earthquake is said to have been well-received around Yoshisada in the suburbs of Shanghai, China, but its historical material, \"The History of the Chinese Earthquake\" which described the earthquake, recorded that it was also referred to as the \"Senkokuchi Great Earthquake\" in Shanghai on December 26, suggesting that the tremor of this earthquake was stronger than that of the Nankai Earthquake at a seismic distance of about 1,000 km. It is said that there was no tsunami in this earthquake, and it is recorded that the tide was no different from normal in Uwajima (according to \"Daiken\"), but in Saeki, it is recorded as 'Urasu Takanami no ho' (\"Goyo Nikki\").

        "paragraph": "A declaration of war is a declaration in which a conflicting state declares its willingness to start a war on a hostilities party. The declaration of war is to officially declare the intention of war in the conflict-related countries. In other words, a declaration of war is to inform the other country or neutral country that it will enter the state of war, and it is often used in the same sense as the opening of war, but in a narrow sense it is a different term. In general, an ultimatum is issued as a precautionary warning before the start of the war. When negotiations broke down and diplomatic negotiations ceased, the diplomatic corps of both sides withdrew. In many cases, this is the end of diplomatic relations. This custom of foreign transportation began during the Renaissance, but it was convened at the United Nations Peace Conference in 1907 due to the fact that the Russo-Japanese War of 1904 was started without declaration of war (it was not a problem because it was ultimatum to Russia two days ago), and it was established as an international rule for the first time in the 'Convention on the Opening of the War' signed on October 18. The treaty stipulated that the effectiveness of the declaration of war would occur at the time the other country received it. However, there was little respect at the time, and after the First World War the League of Nations was reestablished. In armed conflicts between states without declaration of war, there is no application of neutrality laws to third countries that do not receive notice, and third countries are allowed to maintain diplomatic relations similar to peacetime with conflict-related countries. It is not always judged as a war in the state of the cessation of diplomatic relations. After World War I, there were many cases in which the application of wartime international law was avoided because it was not a state of war, even if it was a state of high armed conflict. The 'Convention on the Opening of the War' was stipulated in Article 3 (all warring states must be part of the treaty), and Italy signed the treaty, but did not ratify it, and the status of the declaration of war in the countries involved in World War II became very complicated. There was no official declaration of war in the Second Ethiopian War. During World War II, many states declared war, but during this period, Nazi Germany, with many fronts at the end of the war, opened a war without a formal declaration of war on most fronts.",

'pull shot', in which the player first places the ball at the top of the opponent's goal, and then pulls the stick and rolls the ball in front of his hand, aiming at unguarded areas or corners of the goal.'snake' and 'front pin' are both methods of holding the ball in the shape of a player, or keeping the ball in place.Using these methods, the player can swing the ball in either direction.Table football is often played in pubs, bars, workplaces, schools, and clubs, with little regulation, simply to enjoy.FOOTBALL is also a fairly advanced set of rules and regulations.",

Cook saw surfing in Tahiti and Hawaii, and wrote about it in his voyage diary.Afterwards, Europeans such as Christian missionaries began to migrate to these islands.The missionaries considered the culture of Polynesia to be barbaric, banned surfing, which was part of their culture for reasons of civilization, and further removed the surfboard and burned it.Therefore, surfing in Polynesia came to an end once in the modern era.",

J. R. Murray's \"History of Chess\" was published.This book is still regarded as the sacred text of chess history.History of Chess denies the traditional theory that the origin of chess was the four-player system (although it has not been confirmed that it was the two-player system), but provides a detailed explanation of the four-player chatur-a\u1e45ga.After World War II, Murray revised some of his theories, and the four-player theory returned to the mainstream.",
