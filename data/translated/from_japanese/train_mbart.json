            "The most common gauge in the world is 1435 mm (4 foot note 1]8 1/2 inches), which is called standard gauge.The gauge wider than standard gauge is called wide gauge, and the narrow gauge is called narrow gauge.The narrow gauge that is most common in Japan is 1067 mm, which is commonly used on conventional lines.Changing the gauge is called realignment, but realignment is not done unless there is an overwhelming effect on the periphery, and the cost is enormous, and unless there is an overriding reason.In the curved section, in order for all the wheels to be able to run without the wheel flanges touching the gauge, so that all the wheels cannot turn towards the center of the curve, the inner gauge is slightly extended to the curved centre, and the gauge spacing is extended beyond the specified gauge so that the wheels can run smoothly, and this width is called slack.In the curved section, in order for all the wheels to be able to run without the wheel flanges touching the gauge, so that the inner gauge is slightly extended to the curved centre, and the gauge spacing is extended beyond the specified gauge so that the wheels can run smoothly, and this width is called slack."

            "A curve radius of less than 600 m is provided, but the width is calculated from numerical and experimental values such as the curve radius, the fixed axis distance of the carriage, the gauge, etc., and is set in 5 mm increments, depending on the rank of the curve radius, and the maximum value is set at 30 mm, because taking a large value would create a risk of derailment.Also, a slack of less than 2 mm may be provided even if the curve radius is more than 600 m.The exact definition of the gauge is the distance between the left and right sides of the inner side of the rail in a position that is only a certain length down from the top of the head of the rail, and the shortest distance between the inner side of the rail within a certain range from the top, depending on the country or region, etc.There are slight differences between countries and regions.In the late 19th century, France and Italy used the distance between the center of the rail as the standard gauge, in which case the gauge varies depending on the width of the rail.The origin of the 4-foot-8.5-inch gauge, which is considered the standard gauge in modern times, is the 4-foot-eight-inch gauge used in the carriage railway of the Kiringworth coal mine in northeast England.Although there was a theory that the origin of the Kiringworth wheel gauge can be traced even further back to ancient Roman carriages, it was later denied."

            "\"Osama\" is a 2003 Afghan-Japanese (NHK), Irish-Iranian-Dutch co-production directed by Sedik Balmak, the first film to be made after the reconstruction of Afghanistan.The actors were not actors, but the director found them among the general public.The film won the Camera Doll Award at the Cannes International Film Festival and the Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film.The film was co-produced with NHK and screened at the 2003 NHK Asian Film Festival.A 12-year-old girl who lost her father in the civil war had to work to support her family, but under the Taliban regime, women could not go out without men, so she cut her hair and started working as a boy in a dairy.The Prophet Muhammad married a 6-year-old girl, Aisha, at the age of 53, and she completed her marriage at the age of nine.Therefore, in conservative Islam, marriage and sex with girls over the age of nine are legal (although medically dangerous), and acts such as the ending of this film are considered to be no problem in such a society."

(JR Hokkaido), and in 2007 an experimental train was manufactured and verification tests were conducted at the Naeho Plant.The Hokkaido Shinkansen is supposed to run the same track as the Aobako Tunnel and the common section before and after it (Shin-Nakakokuni Signal Station - Kikouchi Station) by dividing the strait line into three tracks.Although it is not a problem to run only because the tracks are originally made by Shinkansen standards, the maximum speed of the current freight trains is less than 110 km/h, and the waiting facilities can only be made before and after the Aobako Tunnel, so it may be a bottleneck for dialing."

            "The basin area of the Tone River, including its tributaries, accounts for about one-half of the total area of the Kanto Plain.The plateau consists of the Musashino Plateau, the Sagamino Plateau (the Sagamihara Plateau), the Omiya Plateau, and the Shimousa Plateau, and is covered with volcanic ash soil called the Kanto Rom Formation (from Mt. Fuji, Mt. Hakone, Mt. Asama, Mt. Akashiro, Mt. Ototai, Mt. Nasu in the southern Kanto, and Mt. Tama, Mt. Sayama, Mt. Kaji, and Mt. Hiki in the northern Kanto).The Kanto Plain is Japan's largest plain, and has been formed by a change in the Kanto basin movement that has been continuing since the New Tertiary.This is a movement in which the subsidence occurs mainly in the central part of the present-day Kanto Plain (the Kasu Basin), and the surrounding mountains rise.This causes the accumulation of soil and sand from the surrounding mountains to be very thick (the Tertiary Formation reaches 3,000 meters), and by the further rise, many hills and plateaus were formed.It is believed that large structural lines such as the eastern edge line of the Fossa Magna and the central structural line exist in the central part of the plain, but because of this thick accumulation of soft sedimentary layers, it is difficult to find active faults that cause earthquakes (the faults exist at the base of 3,000 meters below the sedimentary layer)."

            "Niigata Station (Niigata Station) is a station of the East Japan Railway Company (JR East) located at Hanazono 1-chome, Chuo-ku, Niigata City, Niigata Prefecture.It is the largest passenger terminal station in Niigata City, and is responsible for a wide range of transportation from wide-area transportation such as the Joetsu Shinkansen and the Nihon Kaijukan Line to regional transportation in the Niigata metropolitan area.It is also a base for public transportation other than railways such as route buses and high-speed buses.Currently, the continuous three-dimensional intersection of the conventional line around the station building and related development projects are being carried out (details will be described later).The office management code is\u25b2301150.This station is the terminus of the Joetsu Shinkansen and the following three lines of the conventional line, each of which is the starting point or the end point of this station.Note 1]Incidentally, the Iwagoe West Line, which shares the Niigata Station - Shintsu Station of the Shin-etsu Main Line on the official website of JR East, is also indicated as the line belonging to this station J 1].There are also trains that cross this station and cross the above three lines directly to each other.The first railway station opened in the present Niigata City area was Numatari Station, which was established in Numatari-cho Ryugashima, Nakagamahara-gun (now: Numatari-higashi and Ryugashima near Numatari-cho, Chuo-ku, Niigata City) and was opened on November 20, 1897."

            "At that time, Niigata City on the left bank of the Shinano River and Numatari-cho on the right bank of the Shinano River were engaged in a fierce battle for the establishment of a railway, but the width of the Shinano River at that time was about 1 km wide and the construction of an iron bridge required a huge amount of money, so the two sides agreed on an eclectic plan of establishing 'Niigata Station' at the Numatari-cho school production site (present-day Manshiro, Benten, and Yachiyo, Chuo Ward, Niigata City) near the Higashizume of Manshiro Bridge on the right bank of the Shinano River.However, Hokuetsu Railway virtually rejected this plan on the grounds that the land price was high, and the 'Numatari Station' that Ryuga had established on the island was the terminus station.Although there was a movement against this on the Niigata City side, the controversy intensified due to the government's approval, and some members of the 'Railway Comrades Association' on the city side radicalized their actions.They caused a riot to attack people who valued Numatari Station, and furthermore, on the early morning of November 11, ahead of the scheduled date of the railway opening on November 16 of the same year, bombs were planted in the locomotive and freight depots on the site of Numatari Station and on the iron bridge on the Shinkurinogigawa River, and the riot developed into a riot to blow up the railway.Fortunately, the damage was minor and the operation was only delayed by four days."

            "In 1869, Takeshiro MATSUURA, who had been exploring Ezo and interacting with Ainu, submitted a Kenpaku to the government and presented six proposals: Hidakami-do Road, Kitakai-do Road, Kaihoku-do Road, Kaishima-do Road, Tohoku-do Road, and Senshima-do Road.The Meiji government decided to use Hokkaido based on 'Kitakai-do Road' and to change 'Kai' to 'Kai'.By the proclamation of Dajokan (Grand Council of State) on August 15, 1869, it was widely known that 'Ezo is now called Hokkaido, divided into eleven provinces, and the names of the provinces and districts are written on a separate sheet of paper.'Incidentally, Matsuura explained in the Kenpaku that the idea of 'Kitakai-do Road' was devised because Ainu called himself 'Kai.'However, linguist Ikkyosuke KANEDA argued that no evidence of such a fact had been found at the time.Hokkaido is considered to be one of ordinary local public organizations (prefectures) equivalent to other 'Tsu, Fu, and Prefectures' in the Local Self-Government Law, but in the case of 'Tsu, Fu, and Prefectures,' it is sometimes referred to and named as 'Tokyo,' 'Osaka,' 'Kyoto,' 'Toyama,' and 'Fukuoka.'However, in the case of Hokkaido, it is very rare for Hokkaido to be referred to and named simply as 'Hokkaido' by omitting 'Do' (although there are cases in which it is used as part of firm pronouns such as company names and school names such as Hokkaido Times, Hokkaido Gakuen University, etc.)."

            "Future (French: futur, German: Zukunft, English: future) is also used as a \"future word\" and is sometimes used as an adjective.Future (mirai) is something that comes after the present in time.As long as time and physical laws exist, the coming of the future is considered inevitable.Due to the obvious nature of reality and the inevitability of the future, what exists now and what will exist in the future is classified into two things, permanent and temporary.The concept of eternity and the future have been the main subjects of philosophy, religion, and science, and it is impossible for even the greatest people to define them without discussion.In Western civilization, which regards time as linear, the future is the expected part of time that extends in one direction.In special relativity theory, the future is considered to be the absolute future, i.e. the future cone of light.In the philosophy of time, there exists the position of presentism, which states that only the present exists and that the past and the future do not exist."

            "In religion, the future is considered when dealing with issues such as karma, the afterlife, and the theory of the end of the world.Religious scholars such as prophets and fortune-tellers claim to be able to see the future.Systematic research to predict the future has arisen from the observation of celestial bodies of ancestors.Futurology is the study, technology, and practice of what is likely to happen in the future.Modern futurists emphasize alternative and pluralistic futures rather than one-size-fits-all futures, emphasizing the limits of prediction and possibilities for the possible creation of a preferred future.The future has been explored through several artistic movements and cultural categories.In the early 20th century, futurists explored all forms of art such as painting, sculpture, poetry, theater, music, architecture, and even gastronomy.Futurists disliked past trends, especially traditions in politics and the arts.Instead, they supported the love of speed, technology, and violence.Futurists' music emphasized respect for machines, the introduction of machines, and the imitation of machines.Futurists embraced other artistic fields, but eventually embraced industrial design, textiles, and architecture.In grammar, \"future\" is one of the tense."

            "It mainly deals with articles on near-to-market game software.One of the most popular sections of Famitsu is the cross-review section, which began on October 31, 1986, with four editors playing the game software as reviewers, each scoring a total of 40 points out of a total of 10 points.If the total score of the four is 32 points or more, they will be inducted into the Hall of Fame, but when it comes to inducting into the Hall of Fame, silver (30-31 points), gold (32-34 points) and platinum (35- points) will rise in order.This section is highly influential, and this cross-review has brought many new works to the forefront.When Famitsu introduced this review format, other home game magazines began to set up corners that imitated it.On the other hand, it is sometimes criticized that the article lacks fairness because of the magnitude of its influence.When Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time earned 40 points for the first time in the history of cross-review, it was questioned that the score was unusually sweet compared to the previous review in other game magazines."

            "Landforms (landforms) are the forms of undulating (convex) surfaces of the earth.Tropology classifies each part of the earth with a specific morphological feature formed by a specific cause, giving each a specific topographic classification term, and they are called landform species and landform units.Landforms are formed by a series of internal, external, and extraneous actions.Internal action produces variable and volcanic landforms, and external action produces eroded and sedimentary landforms.In addition, external action produces collision landforms, but these are rarely seen on Earth today.Landform species (landform units) are classified into seven types, depending on their size: giant landforms, large landforms, medium landforms, small landforms, micro-landforms, micro-landforms, and ultra-micro-landforms.However, even though they are actually the same type of landform, the size of each individual varies widely.Although many proposals have been made for classification examples, there are no internationally standardized ones.Here is Suzuki (1997)'s classification.All landform species have a causal hierarchy.The larger the size of a landform species, the smaller the collection of landform species is, and the larger the size of a landform species, the more complex are the forces, materials, and processes involved in the formation, the thicker the materials, the longer the formation time, and the smaller the internal homogeneity."

            "Four-column manga (\u3088\u3093\u30b3\u30de\u307e\u3093\u304c) is one of the forms of Japanese manga that creates a short story by using four-column stories.It is a form that has been established since ancient times, as it depicts a minimum story, and is published in some newspapers and magazines.There are also many specialized media such as \"4-column manga magazine\" that appeared in the 1980s and \"4-column manga anthology\" that became popular in the 1990s.The basic form of expression is to arrange the four-column lined up as a placement of inheritance and transfer, and the fourth-column lined up as an ochi.In modern Japan, the arrangement of the columns is generally vertical, but historically it is not necessarily so (discussed later), and in areas other than Japan, horizontal arrangements such as \"peanuts\" and two-column structure (\u7530\u306e\u5b57) are seen.In modern Japan, there are works that have two-column or two-column structure in one row.Also, for convenience, the fifth-column (two rows with the fifth-column four times the other rows.Depending on the work, it may be embedded in the last page, but it is often embedded in the first page, in this case usually the large ochi of the fifth-column serves as the title cover)The number of columns may vary, such as three-column (\u5e8f\u7834\u6025), eight-column, etc."

            "Winter (\u3075\u3086) is one of the four seasons, and refers to the coldest period and season in the year.The season between autumn and spring.Like the 24th day of the month and the lunar calendar, the sun's altitude is the lowest in the year and the night is the longest period.In the northern hemisphere, the temperature is often low around January-February after the winter solstice, and in the southern hemisphere, it is around July-August after the summer solstice.The Japan Meteorological Agency calls the day with the lowest temperature of 0 \u00b0C or less on a day a winter day (\u3075\u3086\u3073), and the day with the highest temperature of 0 \u00b0C or less on a day a mid-winter day (\u307e\u3075\u3086\u3073).Since such days occur around December to March of the following year around January in the center of each year (although, depending on the year and region, they may also occur in November and April), in Japan, the area around this time falls into the range of winter.When the northern hemisphere is winter, the southern hemisphere is summer because the sun's altitude is higher, and when the southern hemisphere is winter, the northern hemisphere is summer as well.The season of winter is born because the temperature changes due to the difference in the altitude of the sun.Because the earth is tilted to the earth's axis, the altitude of the sun changes seasonally at the same point, and when the altitude of the sun is low, it becomes winter."

            "The term \"kakaku\" refers to the status and evaluation obtained or given by a certain clan or family line in history.Kakaku is literally a system of evaluation of the family, which was the basis of the order of society as a whole from ancient to modern times when there was a system of rank.Kakaku does not evaluate the family as a whole, but classifies the entire members of the nation or society, and fixed and classifies the positions among the clans by assigning ranks based on the lineage and positions held by the members of certain clans.The difference between the status and positions of the family and other ranks and characteristics of the family was that the status and positions belonged exclusively to individuals, but the evaluation of the family was based on the unit of a particular family.In many cases, the determination of the family rank was fundamentally based on the lineage of the ancestors and the traditional authority accompanying it, and the connection with the Imperial or Royal Household and the closeness of influential clans greatly influenced the family rank.In Japan, since the Heian period, under the Ritsuryo system, the opportunities for the promotion of the ranks through success increased, and as the opportunities for the rise of the status through military decoration increased, centering on the rising samurai, and as the family ranks became hereditary, it became the starting point for the family ranks to be fixed."

            "OPS is an abbreviation of On-base plus slugging, and is one of the indicators used to evaluate batters in baseball.It is a value that combines the batting rate and long batting rate.It is an indicator of the overall batting contribution per seat, and the higher the number, the more batters can be evaluated as contributing to the team's scoring per seat.It is an indicator that can be easily calculated by the sum of the batting rate and long batting rate, and is heavily used in sabermetrics because it has a very strong correlation with scores.It is an indicator that the founder of sabermetrics, Bill James, co-developed with Dick Kramer and Pete Palmer.The impetus for development began when they questioned that the rules of baseball that \"more points\" wins, even though the goal of the attack should be to record more points, but the ranking of attacks is listed in the order of the batting rate that does not evaluate four dead balls or long batting.By the way, since the maximum value of the batting rate is 1.00 and the maximum value of the long batting rate is 4.00, the maximum value of OPS is 5.00.The advantages of OPS that emerged from this is that while it is a relatively easy number to calculate, the correlation with scores is very high."

Sato, who has experience in the U.S. baseball world, introduced the batting height corresponding to OPS in a contract with the Seibu Lions.In MLB in 2013, the OPS when totaling the batting performance of all players was.714.By league, the American League with DH is.725, and the National League without DH is.703."

Basedo (1723-1790) founded the Pan-African Academy in 1774, advocating the transition from church-controlled education to state-controlled education, incorporating educational contents and methods according to the developmental stages and life experiences of children, such as play, crafts, gymnastics, and outdoor activities.C.G. Salzmann (1744-1811), a teacher at the Pan-African Academy, founded a school with the same aim and was appointed principal, where a prototype of academic physical education was created in which all students could run, jump, throw, and do average exercises according to their abilities while being supervised by a physical education teacher and an assistant principal in a dedicated gymnasium.Goutz Moutz (1759-1839), who took up the post of physical education director at the Salzmann school, is said to have theorised that physical education was not a conventional comprehensive physical education, but an independent field as a means of educational exercise, and is called the \"founder of modern physical education\"."

            "Overhead lines (also known as trolley lines, tram lines, etc.) are a type of electric railway system that consists of an overhead line at the top of the space through which a vehicle passes, from which electricity is collected by means of a pantograph or other electrical collecting device.The overhead line is also called a trolley line.The trolley bus is an overhead line system, and most railways have overhead lines and a third track system.The basic structure consists of a trolley line to supply electricity in contact with a pantograph or other electrical collecting device such as a railway vehicle, a hanger, dropper, suspension line, suspension block and curved drawbar that are suspending or supporting fixtures, and supporting fixtures such as electric poles, beams, and movable brackets that support them.In the DC electrification zone, for reliable transmission, a \"feeding line\" is laid along the overhead line from the substation and is connected to the trolley line by a feeder every 250 m as a standard.Because of the method of suspending the trolley line, the weight of the trolley line creates a slack, the longer the support interval, the heavier the weight, and the lower the tension, the greater the slack."

            "If the speed of the vehicle is low, even if the relaxation of the trolley wire is somewhat large, there is no problem in the following up of the collector to the trolley wire, but if the speed of the vehicle is high, the up and down movement of the collector (pantagraph) becomes intense, and it is easier to cause obstacles such as disconnection from the trolley wire.Therefore, it is necessary to give appropriate tension to the bracket.When the collector passes through the trolley wire, the trolley wire is pushed up, and after passing, the vibration attenuates after causing free vibration.The bracket has a push-up spring constant, and the supporting supporting point of the bracket is large, and the center of the radius between the supporting points is small in the middle vicinity, so when the collector passes through, the amount of push-up of the bracket is small at the supporting point, and the amount of push-up is large at the center of the radius, so the collector will proceed with repeated up and down fluctuations.Materials: Wire for feeding wire is used more than hard copper and wire for hard aluminum.Hard copper trolley wire is mainly used for trolley wire, silver-plated copper trolley wire with increased heat resistance, CS trolley wire with steel core in copper for high-speed section of Shinkansen, tin-plated copper and precipitation-reinforced copper alloy (PHC) trolley wire with excellent wear resistance."

            "The 2009 Nippon Series (Japanese: \u306b\u305b\u3093\u304d\u3085\u3046\u306d\u3093\u306e\u306b\u3063\u307d\u3093\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba) was the 60th edition of the Japan Professional Baseball Championship (JPL) between the Yomiuri Giants and Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters, which was held from October 31 to November 7, 2009.The Giants vs. Nippon Ham was the second match in 28 years since 1981.The Nippon Ham had never played in the Japan Series between 1988 and 2003, when it was based at the Tokyo Dome, so it was the first Japan Series game held at the Tokyo Dome in the history of the team, even though it was played as a visitor team in the third round of the series.As a special measure against the infection of the new influenza, the number of eligible players (40 people) was abolished.However, the number of people who can enter the bench (25 people) remained unchanged.Admission revenue was 1,281,696,000 yen, the Giants' distribution to players was 1,191,8601 yen (the highest ever distribution), and the Nippon Ham was 795,457,534 yen.The distribution to both teams was 208,836,6134 yen.The Yankees continued to say that the Pa League team will not be the best in Japan in the Oxley Year and will not be able to play the championship."
