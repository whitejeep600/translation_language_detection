            "Fruit (cauliflower) Biologically, a fruit is a structure of a fruit plant that contains seeds in it.Since the seeds of a fruit plant mature in the cauliflower, the cauliflower is the part that becomes a fruit, and the seeds of all other fruit plants are in the fruit.When one hears a fruit, one gets the impression that it can be eaten with flesh, because there are not a few seeds that form such a fruit and it was an important food for humans.Such fruits are thought to have evolved as a plant breeding strategy to develop the part that becomes an animal's food around the seeds, and to spread the seeds through the animal's body by being eaten.Such evolution of edible evolution has different evolutionary directions depending on the target to be eaten, and to produce fruit corresponding to it.For example, those that evolved to be eaten by birds resulted in the top of the tree, and the size is about a few millimeters for many birds, and it has a prominent color to appeal to the visual.On the contrary, mammals have a strong sense of smell against birds, and many have evolved to emit a strong smell."

            "The Tokaido Shinkansen (Tokaido Shinkansen) is a high-speed railway line (shinkansen) of the Tokaido Railway Company (JR Tokai) that connects Tokyo Station to Shin-Osaka Station.It is also called the Tokaido-Sanyo Shinkansen (Tokaido-Sanyo Shinkansen) because many trains run directly to the Sanyo Shinkansen.It is the world's first high-speed railway and has the oldest history as a Shinkansen in Japan.Before the opening of the Tokaido Shinkansen, the Tokaido Main Line, which is a major artery between the east and west, was undergoing rapid economic growth, and the line capacity was tight, and it was forced to drastically increase its transport capacity.In response, the Japan National Railway Company (JNR) decided to build a new standard gauge line capable of high-speed operation under the supervision of Shinji Tokawa, the president of JNR, and Hideo Shima, the chief engineer.The construction ceremony was held on April 20, 1959, at the Atami Exit of the Shintana Tunnel, and the construction began, and it opened on October 1, 1964, just before the opening of the Tokyo Olympic Games.At the planning stage, the line was called the Tokaido Shinkansen, but at the time of opening, it was named the Tokaido Shinkansen.The name Shinkansen is said to be derived from the internal name of the bullet train that was planned between Tokyo Station and Shimonoseki Station before the war."

            "A volt (symbol: V) is a unit of voltage, potential difference, and excitation, meaning the force that pushes out electricity, and represents the height of the potential difference.In Japan, the home voltage is usually 100V.For example, in a river, electricity has the property that the water's momentum (current) is stronger the higher the height difference (higher the voltage) is, as is the difference between upstream and downstream.The name is derived from the physicist Alessandro Volta, who invented the Volta battery.A volt can be defined as follows.The expressions are only different, and both values are the same.In the International System of Units (SI), it is an assembly unit, and represented in SI basic units, V = m2\u00b7kg\u00b7s\u22123\u00b7A\u22121.The electrical resistance of one ampere of current flowing when applying a volt voltage is 1 ohm (\u03a9).The ohm is defined from a volt and an ampere (\u03a9 = V/A).According to the original sound, it is sometimes denoted as a volt.In 1800, Alessandro Volta invented the Volta battery.In 1874, the British Association for the Advancement of Science (BAAS) defined the unit of excitation volt, named after Volta, along with the unit of electrical resistance ohm."
