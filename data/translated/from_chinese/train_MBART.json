The interaction of the spotted hyena with humans has a long history, with human depictions of it first appearing in the late Paleolithic, including paintings and sculptures of the Lascaux Caves and Shawnee Caves. The spotted hyena has a bad reputation in both Western culture and traditional African religions. In the former, the spotted hyena is considered to be an ugly and cowardly animal; in the latter, it is considered to be a greedy, gluttonous, stupid but also powerful and potentially dangerous animal. Western impressions of the hyena are mostly derived from the writings of Aristotle and Pliny the Elder, although the descriptions of the two do not carry much criticism.",

Newton's law of universal gravitation in classical mechanics is an excellent approximation of gravity under normal physical conditions.

Therefore, even if the temperature of the plasma is low enough, the average velocity at which these particles move is still very fast. This leads to the conclusion that even if the object has been compressed to a very small space, it still takes a great deal of force to control the particle's momentum. Unlike the classical ideal gas where pressure is proportional to temperature (P = nkT/V, where P is pressure, V is volume, n is the number of particles - a typical atom or molecule, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is temperature), the relationship between pressure and temperature of degenerate matter is very weak, in particular, the pressure has not yet reached zero, or even is already at absolute zero.",

After the victory in the war, the Fifth Army was one of the five main components of the NRA. It was annihilated in the Battle of Huaihai in 1949 (i.e. the Qiu Qingquan Corps). It was rebuilt and withdrawn to Kinmen. Originally used as the \"Fortune Army\" of the NRA, this flagship was for the \"Fortune Army\" of Li Fulin, mainly a \"Green Forest Unit\", established in the Henan area of Guangzhou after the Xinhai Revolution, mainly active in the Pearl River Basin, the army was originally formed by local bandits and militias. Li Fulin supported Long Jiguang during the second revolution, so although he was inclined to the NRA, he was not disbanded.",

Due to the lack of long-lived isotopes, only trace amounts of it occur in nature in uranium ores, predominantly 227Ac, as a decay product of 235U. Each tonne of uranium ores contains about 0.2 milligrams of the element. As the chemical and physical properties of uranium and lanthanum are too close, it is unrealistic to separate the element from the ores. Scientists have produced it in nuclear reactors by neutron irradiation with radium-226. Uranium is rare, expensive, and highly radioactive, so it has little industrial use. Currently, it is used as a neutron source, and as a radiation source in radiation therapy. The French chemist Andr\u00e9-Louis Debierne announced the discovery of the new element in 1899.",

Particularly notable was the fact that the number of casualties on both sides was not taken into account, even reaching civilians who were not involved in the war. Initially, the German defence forces broke through the Soviet defences in a rapid offensive after the heavy bombing by the Luftwaffe. On September 13, 1942, the Germans invaded Stalingrad and fought a fierce street battle in the city. Although the Germans succeeded in occupying 90% of the city at various stages, they were unable to capture the last part of the Soviet defences. As the Germans slowly advanced through the city, the Soviets assembled a force of about 1,143,500 men on the eastern bank of the Volga River and on the northwestern outskirts of Stalingrad, and in Operation Uranus, launched on November 19, quickly broke through the temporary defensive line established by the Axis forces, surrounded the German Army Group VI and other Axis forces in the city, but was repelled by the Soviets.",

Due to the differences in the size of the core and the envelope, the core does not participate in the expansion of the envelope and the shared envelope, while the shared envelope will contain two objects: the donor star's distant core and the companion star. These two objects (initially) continue their orbital motion within the shared envelope. However, they are thought to lose energy because of the drag of the gas within the envelope, which will take them into a tighter orbit, and increase the actual orbital velocity (thereby increasing the kinetic energy of the two objects, but reducing their kinetic energy in the binary system more than the kinetic energy, thus ultimately resulting in energy loss). The lost orbital energy is assumed to cause the temperature of the envelope to rise and cause the envelope to expand, and at the end of the shared envelope phase, it may be that the envelope dissipates into space, or that the two objects merge within the envelope and do not have more energy to cause the envelope to continue to expand or dissipate.",

In low-mass stars, convection ensures that the entire lithium is easily depleted, so that in brown dwarf candidates, the presence of lithium spectra is an important indicator of the existence of a brown dwarf, otherwise it is a secondary star. A study of the lithium abundance of 53 Taurus T stars has found that lithium depletion is strongly correlated with size, suggesting that lithium burning fusion is carried out via the P-P chain.

In 1941, the city plan announced that Park Road (now Linsen Road) and Outer Ring Road (now China East Road) would be established in today's Eastern District. In the 1970s, the aforementioned roads were finally built, along with the construction of the Zhongshan Expressway, and traffic improvements in the Eastern District grew rapidly. Until the eve of the 2010 municipal merger, the Eastern District was the most populous district in Tainan Province, with nearly 200,000 people. In the 1970s, the Eastern District was repeatedly redeveloped to meet the population growth, during which time many military sites were also released for the use of the city plan. The most important of these was the Fourth Redevelopment District, the Second A Redevelopment District, and the Toro Dormitory Redevelopment District. The Fourth Redevelopment District is located in Takuan Cuo, which has Tainan Cultural Center, a supervisory station, a land administration office, a district public office, a municipal hospital, and other facilities.",

By examining the light curves of stars observed by telescopes or satellites, it is possible to infer whether other stars produce stellar flares. The frequency of solar flares varies greatly with the average 11-year period of activity, ranging from a few days during the solar period to less than a week during the quiet period (see solar cycle). Large flares appear at a much lower frequency than small ones. According to NASA observations, on July 23, 2012, a solar superstorm with a large and potentially destructive force (flares, coronal mass ejections, and solar electromagnetic pulses) passed over the Earth and accelerated charged particles, mainly electrons interacting with plasma material.",

However, his theory did not gain much support at the time, when most geologists believed that there were no craters left on Earth. In the 1920s, American geologist Walter H. Bucher studied a series of craters in the United States. He concluded that these craters were caused by large explosions, but he believed that these explosions were caused by strong volcanic eruptions.

Areas that are specifically related to galactic tides include galactic collisions, the collapse of dwarf or satellite galaxies, and the Oort cloud of the Solar System, which is affected by galactic tides. When an object (the blue object on the left) is in the gravitational field of a massive object (the yellow object), it is distorted by the tidal force. According to Newton's law of universal gravitation, gravity increases with distance. The closer one approaches another object B, the more intensely A is affected by the gravitational force of B. This is also true for different parts of the object, where the surface of A is attracted by B more strongly than the core of A. When the gravitational force of other objects is particularly strong, this causes the distance between the surface of the smaller object and the core of the object to be pulled apart, and the object tends to flatten in the direction of the larger object.",

As with all radar measurements, these measurements depend on the time it takes for the light to return from an object. Then, these measurements are compared to those calculated by astrophysics: the calculated positions are usually called a calendar table, and are calculated using astronomical units. These comparisons use the speed of light on astronomical units, with a value of 173.144 632 6847 (69) AU/d (Barycentric Dynamical Time, TDB).",

Lassell supported Herschel's seven known Saturn moons as early as 1847 and named the eighth newly discovered moons in 1848 on the basis of Herschel's naming plan.",

Some officials in China have recognized that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is not a socialist republic, because the Korean Labour Party abandoned Marxism-Leninism in 1980 and established the idea of subjectivity as the only guiding ideology. Because of differences in the understanding of Marxism and its political objectives, different types of Marxists have completely different views on what constitutes a socialist republic. For all Marxists who oppose Stalinism, for example, democratic socialists believe that \"there is no socialism without democracy.\" Social democracy is theoretically universal, and universal suffrage includes the right to vote and the universal right to be elected.",

In the case of suicide, the motives of each suicide attempter are different, and the psychological quality of the individual, the microenvironment and the degree of social support in the vicinity play a major role.

The Dutch discovered Queensland around the 17th century. In 1770, Captain Cook of the British Navy charted the coastline of Queensland. After 1810, a wave of gold rush attracted many immigrants, and the land lease schemes granted by the colonial government further encouraged the flow of free immigrants. Queensland was part of the British colony of New South Wales until 6 June 1859; on 6 June 1859, Queensland enacted the first new law; and on 10 December that year, the first Governor of Queensland, Sir John Bowen, formally proclaimed the independence of Queensland from New South Wales as a self-governing colony.",

The industrial production of hydrogen mainly used natural gas in the process of steam reforming, or through energy-consuming hydroelectric reactions. Hydrogen is more commonly found in nature in the form of hydrogen (a diatomic hydrogen molecule), with a few instances of single-atomic hydrogen. Hydrogen is a highly flammable substance, as long as its volume ratio in air is between 4% and 75%, it can burn at concentrations of 4% to 74% when mixed with air, or at concentrations of 5% to 95% when mixed with chlorine, forming an explosive mixture, which can be ignited by sparks, high temperatures or sunlight.",

Since Sweden has long been below the freezing point, the use of the opposite of the current centigrade can avoid the generation of negative numbers.

Uranus is only one-tenth the age of the Sun, but has a mass 2.1 times that of the Sun, and is expected to live only one-tenth as long as the Sun; both stars are currently nearing the midpoint of their lifespans. Uranus's spectrum is classified as A0V, slightly warmer than Sirius's A1V. It is still in the main sequence star stage, fusing hydrogen in its core into helium to emit light and heat. Uranus has an unusually low abundance of helium-heavy elements (larger atomic sequences), and its luminosity varies slightly from period to period, so astronomers suspect it to be a variable star. It rotates quite rapidly, with an equatorial rotation speed of 274 km/s. Centrifugal forces push it out of the equator, with temperature variations reaching their maximum through the surface of the photosphere at the pole.",

From a thermodynamic point of view, at the melting point, the change in the Gibbs energy of the material \u0394G is zero, but the increases in plutonium (H) and entropy (S) (\u2206H, \u2206S > 0). When the Gibbs energy of the liquid is lower than that of the solid, the material melts. This temperature is related to pressure. Low-temperature helium is the only known material that does not absorb heat when melting. Among the most commonly used principles for melting is Lindemann's principle. Lindemann's principle believes that melting is caused by vibrational instability, when the thermal oscillation amplitude of the atoms in the crystal is higher than the distance between the atoms, the crystal melts, i.e. <\u03b4u2>1/2 > \u03b4LRs:177, where Lindemann's principle is consistent with experimental data on crystal materials, and also with glass transformation data on amorphous materials.",

It may have originally been an O-type main sequence star. Star distances can be used to measure the parallax produced when the Earth orbits the Sun. However, the parallax of VY Canis Major is too small and the error is too large to use this method. In 1976, Charles J. Lada and Mark J. Reid discovered a molecular cloud at the 15th corner to the east of VY Canis Major.",

The current geomagnetic N Pole is located near Greenland in the northern hemisphere, in fact it is the S Pole of the geomagnetic field, and the geomagnetic S Pole is the N Pole of the geomagnetic field. When heat is emitted from the Earth's nucleus, it causes the convection motion of molten iron in the outer nucleus, which generates electricity, and the geomagnetic field is the result of this electricity. This principle of the formation of the celestial magnetic field is called generator theory. The N Pole is usually located near the geographic pole, but its position can vary considerably on a geological time scale.",

The unit of density in the International System of Units is kg/m3, the other common units are g/cm3, and the common unit of density in engineering is t/m3. Density reflects a property of the substance itself, and can therefore be influenced by external factors. In general, the main physical quantities affecting the density of matter are pressure and temperature. The influence of pressure and temperature on the density of gases is more pronounced. Gases usually give only the density under standard conditions or at constant temperature, while density under other conditions can be calculated by the equation of the state of gases (such as the ideal gas state equation or the Van der Waals equation).",

In 1690, he observed Jupiter's atmosphere and discovered that Jupiter's equator rotated twice as fast as it did, thereby discovering that Jupiter's rotation was distorted. In 1675, he discovered a dark gap in the middle of Saturn's light ring, which was later named after him. He speculated that the ring was composed of countless small particles. Spectroscopic observations more than two centuries later confirmed his conjecture. From 1671 to 1679, he carefully observed the surface features of the Moon, and in 1679 he sent a large moon map to the French Royal Academy of Sciences.

        "paragraph": "satire is a literary genre used to expose the contradictions or flaws of an object. It is often exaggerated or caricatured in order to produce a humorous effect. It is usually used to humiliate or expose the flaws of an individual, company, government, or society itself in order to make improvements. Of course, bad imitation, acting, adjacency, juxtaposition, parallelism, contrast, analogy, analogies, etc. are also often used in satire techniques. To say that satire is satire is a big mistake. Strictly speaking, satire is a colloquial type; and satire is a more specific modification technique. Although satire usually means humor, its larger purpose is often constructive social criticism, using intelligence to draw people's attention to specific problems in society and to wider problems.",

The astronomer John Frederick William Herschel (son of William Herschel, also the discoverer of Satellite I and Satellite II) later suggested in Results of Astronomical Observations made at the Cape of Good Hope that these seven moons should be named after the Titan family, a suggestion that was later formally adopted.",

Asteroseismology is a tool for studying the internal structure of a star. Vibration frequency can provide the source of seismic waves and the density of matter passing through the region. Star spectra can allow astronomers to analyze the composition of stars, so spectroscopy and asteroseismology combine to learn about the internal structure of a star. Asteroseismology can change the light of a star into acoustic waves. Asteroseismologists propose that the vibration in a star is caused by the conversion of thermal energy into pulsating kinetic energy. This process is similar to any heat engine, where heat is absorbed in the high-temperature vibrational phase and released at low temperatures.",

In 1913, the first parliamentary elections of the Republic of China ended, and the Kuomintang, representing the Southern Revolutionary forces, obtained a parliamentary majority. Kuomintang secretary-general Song Kyoren was assassinated in Shanghai on his way to Beijing. The Kuomintang asserted that Yuan Shikai was the assassin's mastermind, and with his influence, launched a series of wars against Yuan and the subsequent North Sea government. On December 12, 1915, Yuan Shikai proclaimed himself emperor, changed the Yuan Hong Keng, and on December 25, Tsai Yuan, Tang Jiyao, Li Li Lijun, and others in Kunming proclaimed Yunnan independence, and launched a nation-protection movement. In 1916, Liu Xianzeng of Guizhou, Guangxi Lurong Ting, Guangsu Governor Feng Kunzhang, Jiangxi Governor Li Jun, Zhejiang Governor Zhu Rui, Hunan Governor Yuan Yuan Ming, Shandong Governor Jin Yunpeng and other five marshals joined forces to suppress the imperial palace, and various foreign envoys expressed their opposition. In March, Yuan Shikai ordered the abolition of the Hong Keng imperial system, and on June 6, Yuan Shikai died in anger. After Yuan Shikai's death, the North Sea soldiers went their separate ways, splitting internally, forming three main forces: the Anhui branch led by Dan Qiray, the direct branch led by Cao Yuan, and the subordinate branch led by Zhang Shaolin.",

The most spectacular accretion disks found in nature are those of active galactic nuclei and quasars, which are thought to be massive black holes in the center of the galaxy. When matter enters the accretion disk, it follows a trajectory known as the Tendex line, which describes a spiral line inward. This is because particles friction and bounce back against each other in turbulence, causing frictional heating, thereby emitting energy, reducing the angular momentum of the particles, causing the particles to drift inward, thereby pushing the spiral inward. The loss of angular momentum is represented by a decrease in velocity; at slower velocities, the particles must adopt a lower orbit. When the particles fall to this lower orbit, part of their gravitational potential energy is converted into additional velocity, and the particles are accelerated.",

However, in the understanding of common people and most social scientists, democratization usually refers to the process of transition from authoritarianism or totalitarianism to liberal democracy. In this process, the organization of political power may change in essence. The social ecology of democratization will change greatly. According to the famous American political scientist Samuel Phillips Huntington in his book \"The Third Wave: The Wave of Democracy in the Late 20th Century\", it is common to divide the modern history of democratization into three waves, the first wave began with American independence and the French Revolution, which led to the democratization movement throughout Europe at the end of the 19th century; the second wave began with the wave of national-state independence after the Second World War, but gradually declined in the 1960s. The third wave of democratization is generally considered to have originated in the transition of power between Greece, Portugal and Spain in South Europe between 1974 and 1975, including Brazil and Argentina and Chile in Latin America, followed by the June Movement in South Korea in Asia and the Taiwan Resolution of the Republic of China, and finally ended with the democratization of Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Yugoslavia, Albania and the former Soviet republics and Mongolia in Eastern Europe.",

With only a few hours of accumulation and gravity compression, these substances can begin to fuse. Usually, an increase in temperature (above 1 \u00d7 109 k) causes thermal uncontrollable. The explosion of this star's nuclear synthesis begins with thermal carbon-nitrogen-oxygen cycle, rapidly undergoes the Rp-process, the accreted matter burns out within a few seconds, and the energy it provides is the bright X-ray flash observed by X-ray telescopes. Theoretical evidence suggests that, at least in some cases, the accreted hydrogen will continue to burn continuously, causing the accumulated helium to burst. The behavior of the X-ray burst source is similar to that of a nova. In the case of dense white dwarfs, the continuous accretion of hydrogen may eventually cause an uncontrollable explosion.",

A neutron without an electric charge is composed of one super quark and two lower quarks. By weak interactions, the super quark can also change its flavor to a lower quark, resulting in \u03b2 radiation. positron emission is caused by the transformation of an upper quark into a lower quark. Nuclei capable of positron emission can also be electron captured. For low-energy decay, electron capture has an energy advantage of 2mec2 = 1.022 MeV, because the final state has one electron less than one more positron. As the decay energy increases, the branching fraction also increases. However, if the energy difference is less than 2mec2, positron emission will not occur, and only electron capture can occur.",

Most planetary nebulae are thought to be formed as follows: At the end of the star's life, the stage of the red giant, the outer gaseous shells were blown into space by strong stellar winds. After most of the red giant's gas was scattered, ultraviolet radiation from the hot planetary nebula nucleus (PNN) ionized the scattered outer gas. Absorbing ultraviolet high-energy gaseous shells around the central star emitted a faint fluorescence, making it a colorful planetary nebula. Planetary nebulae played a key role in the chemistry of the evolution of the Milky Way, diffusing elements created by stars into elements in interstellar matter.",

At the same time, the nucleus is torn apart by an unrestricted electrostatic repulsion force between the protons. The information that a physicist trying to synthesize superheavy elements can get is the information collected by the detector: the location, energy and time of the particle's arrival on the detector, and the information about the decay of the particle.

In 1983, it was re-established as a city at the district level. The city of Xiangtan was founded in the Southern Song Dynasty. The following mainly describes the history of the city of Xiangtan. Historically, the entire territory of Xiangtan City is composed of Xiangtan County and Xiangxiang County. The development of the two areas is not the same, and Xiangxiang City developed even earlier than Xiangtan. Therefore, for the comprehensive history of the current territory of Xiangtan City, please refer to the history of Xiangtan, Xiangxiang City and Shaoshan City. Stoneware and pottery excavated at Jinqi Village in Yangjiaqiao Town, Jinshi Town in Xiangtan City, Daiziping Site in Jinshi Town, prove that the inhabitants of the Stone Age have reached a higher level of civilization. The site of Daxi Culture indicates that the settlement of Xiangtan began 5,000 years ago. Furthermore, the bronze porcupine statue of the late Shang Dynasty excavated at Mt. Funagata, and the burial grounds of the Warring States period, reflect the city of Xiangtan that was formed at that time.",

        "paragraph": "Corona Australis is a minor constellation in the southern sky, originally named Corona Australis, meaning \"the southern crown\" and corresponding to Corona Australis (\"the northern crown\") in the northern sky. Corona Australis is one of the 48 constellations identified by the astronomer Claudius Ptolemy in the 2nd century AD, and one of the 88 modern constellations recognized by the International Astronomical Union. In the eyes of the ancient Greeks, Corona Australis had nothing to do with the crown, but was associated with the flower rings of Capricorn or Centaurus. Other civilizations viewed it as the home of turtles, ostrich nests, tents, or hares. Corona Australis is less luminous than Corona Australis, but its brightest stars are elliptical or horseshoe-shaped, and are prominent in the night sky. Capricorn 6 and Beta Corona Australis are the two brightest stars in the constellation, both of 4.1 magnitudes.",
