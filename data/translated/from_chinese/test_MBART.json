In 1604, the Emperor issued the Emperor's decree: Lu Song He (\u5442\u5b8b\u914b) should kill the merchants, and punish the officials for their crimes. It is believed that the death penalty was imposed on him, and that he was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of his wife and children, but he did not commit the crime. The Chinese then went to Lu Song again, and the barbarians profited from the Chinese market, but they did not reject it, and they were reunited for a long time. In 1609, more than 20,000 Chinese were murdered because Chinese merchants protested overtaxation. Six years after the massacre, 50,000 Chinese merchants were massacred by Spaniards in Luzon, Philippines. There's some controversy about how this will be handled in the morning. In 1639, the Spaniards forced the Chinese to pay high-value identification taxes and rents, which were resisted, and the Spaniards again massacred the Chinese, and the Ming Dynasty was deeply engulfed in warfare: the Ming army gathered 300,000 men from nine sides and defeated the eight flags of Manchuria, resulting in the overthrow of the entire army; locusts, droughts, famine, and starvation occurred in Shaanxi, Henan, Shandong, etc.; Li Jianzheng led 17 cavalry across the central plain, gathered 500,000 troops; Zhang Zhenzhong rebelled in Hubei Valley City against the Ming, inflicted havoc on two lakes, and destroyed the Yueyang Tower in the fire. So the court neglected overseas affairs. In 1654, Dominic I, the Italian priest Licol\u00f2, sailed from Manila to Xiamen, was commissioned by Mong Cheng, built a church, held a public service.

Judiciary refers to a court or a specific body that, in accordance with its statutory powers and procedures, specifically applies the law to the hearing and trial of civil and criminal cases. The common law holds that justice is trial and judgment. In the ordinary legal system, only the judiciary has the power to interpret the law (including the Constitution). In continental law, the court conducts a specific inquiry into the case; the judge summons witnesses, question witnesses, defendants, and so on. The court has the power to interpret the law, but does not necessarily have the final power to interpret the law. In addition, prosecutors are often part of the judicial system. Under ordinary law, the court does not conduct a specific inquiry into the case. The role of a judge or magistrate is merely to ensure that the plaintiff (or, in criminal cases, the government's lawyer) and the defendant are able to present their case fairly and reach a decision. If the defendant is charged with a serious crime (such as murder, rape, etc.), in some jurisdictions (such as Hong Kong, the United Kingdom, and the United States) it is the jury that decides whether the defendant is guilty, and the judge is solely responsible for determining the punishment. In common law, only the court has the power to interpret the law, and the court's interpretation and judgment of the law are binding on subsequent similar actions, becoming case law.

In 1919, he was appointed as an engineer and director of the Hankou Xiechang Fireworks Factory. In 1920, Wu founded the Incheon Beef Leather Factory in Shanghai. In the 1920s, following Japan's invention of taste buds, young Wu Yinchuan developed his own taste buds from grains in his lab. But Wu Yingzhuang, who had come out of the laboratory, encountered many obstacles, until he met Zhang Yiyun, the great soybean king of Zhejiang. It was Zhang's unique insight and hard work that led to the creation of the perfect combination of national industrial capital and technology, as well as the chemist Wu Yingzhuang, who had originally worn a long grey cloth and buried his head in the laboratory to invent, creating the taste of the great king known to all adults.

However, after the invasion of Poland, Germany began to attempt to establish an empire in Europe, starting a series of wars from 1939 to 1941 that resulted in Germany occupying most of Europe and signing the Tripartite Pact with Italy and Japan. The declaration of neutrality was followed by the signing of the Treaty of Non-Aggression between the Soviet Union and Germany, which led to the invasion and subsequent occupation or annexation of six countries on Europe's borders, including Poland, which had been occupied at the outbreak of World War II. The British and Commonwealth nations continued to fight the Axis powers, and numerous military conflicts broke out in North Africa and the Atlantic Ocean, making Britain one of the few major European powers still resisting German invasion. In June 1941, Europe's Axis powers decided to tear up their co-operation with the Soviet Union and invade the Soviet Union in a joint offensive that resulted in the largest ground operation in human history, Operation Barbarossa. By December 1941, the Axis powers in Asia had been weakening for many years in the Battle of China, in order to gain leadership in Asia and the Pacific, launched the Pearl Harbor Incident, attacked the British and American colonies in the Pacific to seize Southern Ocean resources, led the United States to declare war on the Axis powers, and the pattern of the Eurasian War clearly emerged.",

In the post-war period of the Republic of China, the government of the Republic of China, which regarded itself as a liberated colony, expanded the implementation of democracy to a small extent during the initial occupation, but the short post-war period of democracy, due to the events of the 1920s and the outbreak of the Second Republic Civil War, turned into a period of martial law under the oppressive rule of the Kuomintang. This was followed by a series of political struggles under martial law, including the earthquake, the out-of-party movement, the Zhongli Incident, the Hashimoto Incident, and the Beautiful Island Incident, which culminated in comprehensive democratization reforms in the 1990s. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, democratic ideas were introduced to Taiwan through Western countries. In 1895, during the Second Sino-Japanese War, Taiwan was declared a democracy. The main purpose of Taiwan's establishment was not to pursue democracy, but to resist the Japanese takeover. In the Declaration of the Democratic Republic of Taiwan, he argued that \"Taiwan is independent, rebuilding a democracy; all government officials are elected by the people, and all political matters are handled fairly\", indicating that democratic thought had begun to germinate in Taiwan at that time.

In terms of geodesy, the meridian across the center of the main building of the Pulkovo Observatory is the starting point on all the maps published in Russia in the past. Due to the geographical northern latitude of the observatory, it was impossible to observe the stars to the south, so two observatories were established in present-day Ukraine, located in Sims and Nikolayev, respectively, on the Crimean peninsula. During World War II, the Pulkovo Observatory was heavily bombed by the Germans, almost all of its buildings were destroyed, and some important equipment, library materials, etc. were transferred to St. Petersburg to be properly preserved. By the time the war was over, the Soviet government had decided to rebuild the Pulkovo Observatory. Reconstruction began in 1946 on the ruins of the site, was completed in May 1954 and officially opened, both equipment, personnel and research areas were greatly expanded than before, and new departments such as radio astronomy and instrument manufacturing were established. The original instrumentation was restored, and new equipment was installed, including a 65 cm refractive telescope, an interferometer, a solar telescope, a coronal instrument, and a radio telescope.

        "paragraph": "It was not until marriage became popular that the distinction between legitimate and illegitimate became apparent. The heir has the right to inherit the property and status of the father. A concubine is a concubine or concubine other than a legitimate wife, but \"concubine\" in modern Japanese refers to a woman who is unofficially married and lives with her husband, i.e., a Chinese mistress. During the Heian period, nobles' lawful wife was called Mirenchu, and concubines were not allowed to use this name. Later, the official wife of a minister and a seii taishogun (literally, \"great general who subdues the barbarians\") was called Gotaisho. After the Civil War, it was also known as the House of Lords. From the Edo period onwards, the eligibility of Gotaisho and Gotenchu was strictly regulated, except that Gotaisho became the official wife of the shogun of the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), Gotenchu became the official wife of the Tokugawa shogunate (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), and Gotenchu became the official wife of the Tokugawa shogunate (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun). The three of them, who were later to appear in the Three Houses, had the same status as the Three Houses, and the rightful wife of the Three Houses was also entitled to be called Mirenchu. In the case of a lord with more than 100,000 koku, his lawful wife is called Gozen-sama, and the lawful wife of a lord with less than 100,000 koku is called Ogata. For example, the wife of an Edo bakufu shogun (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) who is married to a person who is of the rank of Shogun (shogunal deputy) of three or more is called \"Goshuden-style\"; the wife of an Edo bakufu shogun who is of the rank of Shogun (shogunal deputy) of four or less is called \"Ozumi-style.\" According to the order of heirs, the eldest son was regarded as the heir, who would inherit the position of the general, and the surname of Takechiyo at birth was also inherited by the heir. Since Takako TAKATSUKASA, the lawful wife of the third shogun, was the head of the palace, it was often entered by the five regents (one, two, nine, Konoe and Takako) or the imperial family, as an acknowledgment of trust between the Imperial Court and the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun). Even samurai-born palaces had to be adopted by the five regents (such as Atsuko KONOE, the thirteenth shogun's stepmother) before they could enter Daio.

During the transit of Venus, after the observed second contact and for some time before the third contact, observers on Earth may see Venus as a droplet of water near the edge of the Sun. Just after the second contact, and before the third contact, a small black \"droplet of tears\" appears between the disk of Venus and the edge of the Sun, making it impossible to determine the exact time of the second and third contacts. This led to the failure of attempts in the 18th century to establish a truly accurate number of astronomical units using the transit of Venus. The black droplet phenomenon has long been believed to be due to Venus' dense atmosphere, and it is also believed to be the first real evidence that Venus has an atmosphere. However, it is now widely believed that the black-drop phenomenon on Venus was caused by turbulence in the Earth's atmosphere or by optical defects in instruments. To find the cause of the black-drop effect, scientists such as Charles Wolff and others in the 19th century created a machine that could retrieve the transits of cash stars because the 1769 technique could not overcome the effects of the black-drop phenomenon today, and astronomers at the time were unable to determine the exact time when the transits began and ended. This phenomenon has long been believed to be caused by Venus' dense atmosphere, and is one of the evidences for the existence of Venus' atmosphere. However, recent research suggests that this effect may be due to a flaw in the instrumentation. In 2012, Jay Pasachoff and William Sheehan, based on observations by Pasachoff et al. of the 2004 transit of Andromeda, suggested that the conditions observed by Lomonosov should not have been caused by the atmosphere of Venus, but by the \"black-drop phenomenon\" observed during the June 8, 2004 transit of Venus.",

The Communist Party of China often uses the official term \"Taiwan\" to refer to the relationship between the \"Mainland\", the \"Macau Region\" and the \"Free Zone\" (which is no longer commonly used) when dealing with issues on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. \"Freedom Zone\" refers to the Taipei-Kinma region.

The government of the Republic of China accused General Guo Tingliang of plotting a coup d'\u00e9tat and imprisoned Thaksin on the pretext that he \"tolerated the armed rebellion of the armed forces, hid the bandits, and was a conspirator\". More than 300 people were imprisoned. On January 8, 2001, the Taiwan Public Prosecutor's Office re-investigated the case and concluded that Sun Litian had been falsely accused of treason, and after investigating Li Bingnan et al., the deceased anti-Japanese leader claimed that Sun Litian's subordinate Guo Tingliang was a spy, and that the government had deliberately fabricated a hoax. The coup d'\u00e9tat was a series of events, the main purpose of which was to overthrow the Sunni regime. From 1950, Chiang Kai-shek and the Jiaozhi system began to have systematic subordinates of Sun Litian, until 1955, when Sun Litian was officially dismissed and placed under indefinite detention. It is not clear what the real motive of Chiang Kai-shek was, but historians still have no definite opinion, but all tend to support the theory of seizure of power. In 1949, the Republic of China government was defeated in the Sino-Japanese Civil War, and Sun withdrew to Taiwan, where he was invited by Allied Commander-in-Chief Marshal MacArthur to Tokyo, Japan, to discuss military cooperation between the United States and China. During the negotiations, Marshal MacArthur expressed the hope that his grandson would take over the national government, but this was rejected by his grandson. In September, he was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Taiwan Defence Force, Training Corps. In October, the Youth Army participated in the Battle of Kuning Head, winning a victory, stabilizing the National Government's forces in Taiwan.

The film stars Zhang Guorong, Wang Zuxian, Wu Ma, Liu Zhaoming, and other actors include Lin Wei, Xue Zhiren, Wang Jing, and Hu Dawei. In 1978, Xu Ke, who had entered the television industry with the intention of making a horror film, recalled watching Li Hanxiang's version of The Beautiful Ghost as a child, but the producers of Television Broadcasting Ltd. rejected his proposal. Years later, Xu decided to take it to the big screen. The film's story is based on the original novels The Stranger's Tale and Li Hanxiang's version of The Beautiful Ghost, but Xu Ke decided to add a touch of romance to the film to suit the mood of contemporary audiences, and hired Nguy\u1ec5n Chia Chi, who had written the screenplays for several third-rate films. Principal photography on the film began in October 1986, and it took more than five months to complete pre-production. The film had a budget of about $1.2 million, but was twice over budget. The film was well received, grossing more than $18 million in less than a month, and was subsequently released across the country. Most critics praised the film, especially the film's cinematography, visual effects, and acting, and a few called it a cult classic. Over time, many retrospective reviews acclaimed the film, even calling it an important milestone in Hong Kong cinema as it broke the monopoly on comedy and action films and brought the film back to life.",

When trees and shrubs are in their early stages of growth, the vascular layer in the root stem becomes active, develops toughening skins outside, develops wood inside. Wood is a generic term for the development of plant tissue within the vascular formation layer, including woody parts and radioactive thin-walled cells. As the main product of the forestry industry, Wang Baiyun plays a very supportive role in human life. Depending on the characteristics of the wood, people use it in different ways, for example, as a fuel and as a building material. Wood is a natural organic composite, composed of fibrous fibers (high tensile strength) and a matrix of lignin (high compressive strength). Generally, wood is defined as the woody part of the stem that grows secondarily. There's about a trillion tons of timber on the planet, and it's growing by about 10 million tons a year. Timber, which is abundant and is a carbon-neutral renewable material, is one of the renewable energies that's getting a lot of attention. Approximately 3.5 million cubic meters of wood were produced in 1991, mainly for furniture and architectural structures. In 2011, in New Brunswick, Canada, the oldest known woody part, the oldest known plant, was found about 400 million years ago. Wood can be dated by radiocarbon dating, and some plants can be dated by tree rotation. Humans use wood as fuel, or as a covering for houses, tools, weapons, furniture, packaging, crafts, and even paper. Each year the width of the circle and the abundance of isotopes provide some information about the weather conditions at that time. Wood is a complex organic compound with about 44 percent carbon, 6 percent hydrogen, 42.5 percent oxygen, less than 0.5 percent nitrogen, and less than 1 percent other elements.",

The first medium-range ballistic missile was Von Braun's V2 rocket, designed and built during World War II (the \"V\" comes from the German word Vergeltung, meaning \"revenge\").

In 1282, he was appointed commander-in-chief of the army of the People's Republic of China (People's Republic of China). Until 1292, Shunyuan and the 8th and 2nd Xuanxuang Divisions were merged, and the 8th Shunyuan Xuanxuang Division was established in Guiyang, still called Guizhou, but the Yuan Dynasty rulers called Shunyuan City. It was founded in 1289 by the founder of the Yuan dynasty, Emperor Taizong (\u5143\u4e16\u7956), and was located in Jinzhuangzhai (\u91d1\u7af9\u5be8) in Jinzhuangfu (\u91d1\u7af9\u5e9c). At the beginning of the next year, Kinchiku-fu was changed to Kinchiku-chokanshi. With the establishment of Guizhou and other provinces in 1413, Guizhou officially became the 13th province of the Ming Dynasty. In 1568, he moved from Chengbanfu (now Huishui County) to Guizhou City (now Guiyang City).",

Malcolm's definition included only the continental part, excluding the oceanic part. The SEAC promoted the use of the term \"Southeast Asia\", but the concept of early Southeast Asian configuration was not fixed, as most of the Philippines and Indonesia were excluded from the SEAC. By the late 1970s, the general standard usage of the term \"Southeast Asia\" and the territory it encompassed had emerged. The most common definition of \"Southeast Asia\" now includes the regions in which the political entities listed below are located. * Malaysia's administrative center is located in Bujumbura, Southeast Asia, which is geographically divided into two parts: the South-Central Peninsula and the Malay Archipelago. The maritime aspect of Southeast Asia is also referred to as the Malay Archipelago, a term derived from the European concept of the Malay peoples of the South Islands. Ocean Southeast Asia and continental Southeast Asia are divided into the following regions: In addition, Hainan, Guangxi, Guangdong, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Fujian, and southern Yunnan are generally regarded as Southeast Asian regions in terms of natural geography; these regions all have subtropical climates; and historically, the languages spoken by minorities in Guangxi and Yunnan are of the same language family as those spoken in the countries of the South-Central Peninsula (Tungdong, South Asian, or Miao). The indigenous peoples of Taiwan and other Southeast Asian countries, such as the Philippines and Indonesia, belong to the Southeast Asian language family, and Taiwan is also the origin of the Southeast Asian language family. Although the main ethnic group in Taiwan is Han Chinese, the blood composition is similar to that of Southeast Asians due to the large number of indigenous peoples who have been assimilated and married to Han Chinese.",

The starting point of this plan was, by resolutely blocking the reinforcements, to gain as much time as possible for the besieging forces. According to the Qur'an: \"The kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and the kingdom of the earth, and the kingdom of the earth, and the kingdom of the heavens, and the kingdom of the earth, and the kingdom of the earth, and the kingdom of the earth, and the kingdom of the heavens, and the kingdom of the earth, and the kingdom of the earth, and the kingdom of the heavens, and the kingdom of the earth, and the kingdom of the earth, and the kingdom of the heavens, and the kingdom of the earth, and the kingdom of the earth, and the kingdom of the heavens, and the kingdom of the earth, and the kingdom of the earth, and the kingdom of the heavens, and the kingdom of the earth, and the kingdom of the earth, and the kingdom of the heavens, and the kingdom of the earth, and the kingdom of the earth, and the kingdom of the heavens, and the kingdom of the earth, and the kingdom of the earth, and the kingdom of the heavens, and Beginning in August 1948, the National Army was forced to take a key defensive position, defending Jinan with 110,000 troops in the Second Sui Jing District, and preparing to reinforce Jinan with about 170,000 troops in three main regiments in the Xuzhou area (Kyu Qingquan, Li Mia, Huang Ba Tao) at any time northward: 8,656. On August 10, 1948, according to Mao Zedong's orders, \"Awa Yu, Chen Shiqiu, Tang Liang, and Zhang Zhen shall present a plan and unify the command according to the situation,\" the planned three operational plans for the attack on Jinan were jointly reported to Mao Zedong and reported to the Shandong Military Regiment Xu Zhengyu, Tan Zhenlin, and others. Three proposals were made. The first plan was to move south of Xuzhou, to encircle and reinforce. The second plan was to attack Jinan head-on, with reinforcements. The third plan was to \"capture Jinan and reinforce it simultaneously, but with a focus on equipping and using troops.\" The third option is the best. In the telegram, Awyu also issued a special order to the Shandong Military Regiment: \"Please Xu (Seyu) Tan (Zhenlin) Liu (Shokyo) expedite the completion of all preparations for the Siege of Ji, and arrange the battlefield between Zou (county) and Fuji (county).",

Its original map, which treated Stewart Island as a peninsula, treated the Banks Peninsula as an island. Cook's maps led to the expansion of European whaling activity in the area. In 1788, the British annexed New Zealand as part of the Australian colony of New South Wales. It was not until July 1841 that New Zealand was separated from the colony of New South Wales, formally becoming a New Zealand colony. After the Treaty of Waitangi was signed in 1840, New Zealand became a British colony. However, the treaty had two versions in English and Maori, with the British royal representative signing the English version and the Maori signing the Maori version. The M\u0101ori version promised the M\u0101ori \"tino rangatiratanga\", which means \"autonomy\" in M\u0101ori, while the English version translates it as \"leadership position\", with different meanings and interpretations. The word and other issues remain a bittersweet bittersweetness between the New Zealand government and M\u0101ori people. For example, \"Ownership of the Seabed and the Front Sea\" is a property issue. In 1901, the British colonies across the Tasman Sea, including New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, Western Australia, South Australia, Tasmania, and New Zealand, decided to form a new state, the Commonwealth of Australia. New Zealand was initially very interested in joining the Commonwealth of Australia, and actively participated in the drafting of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia, but ultimately decided on its own independence.",

Thus, firearms merely inherited the status of dreadnoughts in weapons, and did not replace bows and arrows nor spears and other combat weapons. It was used as a firearm and cold weapon from the 14th to the early 19th centuries. At the time, firearms were still manufactured by hand, and even though the same type of firearm was of the same caliber, other parts were often incompatible. On 15 September 1714, the Royal Arms Office signed a contract for the development of firearms, which led to the birth of the King's Pattern in 1722, followed by the P1724 prototype in 1728, and the production of the P1730, a series of Brown Bess guns with 120 years of service. The concept of fixed ammunition was invented around the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and is difficult to verify because of the immateriality of logistics. It is a type of ammunition, preloaded with bullets and ammunition, loaded and fired after firing, and the gun is equipped with a trigger, a mother bird gun, and so on. In principle, it is an unresolved aeration problem and has not been widely adopted. Although conventional ammunition was different from modern ammunition at the time, it was still revolutionary in that it pre-determined the amount of good ammunition and ensured that it would not be damp and easy to carry, compared to the difficulty of controlling the amount of ammunition and the dampness of the scattered ammunition at the time.

He accurately deduced that Neptune was a synchronous rotation satellite orbiting Saturn, and that it was much darker on one side than on the other. This was later confirmed by a larger telescope. The difference in brightness between the two hemispheres of Titan is enormous. It is dark on one side (reflection 0.03\u20130.05), slightly reddish-brown on the other, and bright on most of the other side (reflection 0.5\u20130.6, close to Uranus II). So the magnitude on the opposite side of the orbit is 10.2; the magnitude on the same side of the orbit is about 11.9 \u2014 beyond the scope of the best telescopes of the 17th century. This dark surface of David resembles Taoist figures and the surface of tennis. Its dark side is named Cassini, and its bright side is named the Roncesvalles Plateau. The original surface material that formed the dark side was thought to have come from outside of Neptune, and today its surface is composed of crusts left over from the melting of the ice in warmer regions, containing organics similar to those found on the surfaces of primitive meteorites and comets. Observations from Earth have shown that it contains abundant carbon elements, possibly cyanide compounds such as hydrogen cyanide polymers. On September 10, 2007, Cassini flew over the moon from a distance of 1,640 kilometers, and found that both sides of the moon were heavily bombarded.

Over time, the ethnic conflicts that resulted from this inequality became more acute. The emperor declared, \"I am not satisfied with the people, I am pleased with one another.

However, the Manchu emperor, while denying that Han military flag bearers belonged to the Manchus, had an advantageous and entangled aspect, especially after the entry, which was to expand and magnify the Manchus far less than the Han, to consolidate the Manchu subject rule, and to bring the Han military flag bearers who were close to the Manchus and relatively close to the Manchus into the Manchus, especially those Han flag bearers who belonged to the Manchus before the entry.",

The Greeks developed vowels, and the Greeks added vowel alphabets. Ancient Greek originally had 26 letters, which gradually evolved into 24 after the Homeric period, and has continued to be used in modern Greek.

Greek writing uses the Greek alphabet, as described above, with a total of 24 letters, including seven vowels and 17 consonants. Classical Greek is very different from modern Greek. First of all, many words have different meanings, some old words have disappeared, some have new meanings. Secondly, grammatically, classical Greek grammar is more complicated, modern Greek is simpler. In addition, modern Greek is relatively simplified in writing. These simplifications were largely the result of an artificial act of language unification in the 1980s. In fact, due to ethnic complexity, as well as political and religious reasons, the historical Greek language is constantly changing. Classical Greek, however, is indeed a treasure trove of language, containing so many words with such precise meanings, such deep-rooted accuracy, that the naming of many modern things is borrowed from classical Greek.",

A fixed number of levels, domains, boundaries, gates, cords, eyes, families, genera, and species used in a level-based system hierarchy. A levelless system uses an arbitrary number of levels. Groups that are classified are called classification units. Modern biological taxonomy is based on Linnaeus' system, which classifies species according to their shared physiological characteristics. After Linnaeus, the system was gradually improved according to Darwin's principle of common ancestors. In recent years, molecular phylogenetics, which uses bioinformatics to analyze genomic DNA, is radically changing many of the original classifications. Biological taxonomy is a branch of systematic taxonomy. Although Linnaeus used biological classification only as a means of identification, it is now widely accepted that classification should reflect Darwin's principle of common ancestry. With the emergence of cladistics, or cladism, in the 1960s, a taxonomy group was positioned at a particular location in an evolutionary tree. If a taxonomy includes all descendants of a common ancestor, it is called monophyly; if it includes all descendants of a common ancestor, it is called paraphyly; if it does not include all descendants of a common ancestor, it is called polyphyly.

A more radical view within the Indian government is that the McMahon Line was originally intended to mark the border between India and China on the highest ridge of the Himalayas. Whereas the established McMahon Line is south of the Himalayan peak, the original McMahon Line should be considered to be the Himalayan peak north of the actual McMahon Line. Following India's independence in 1947, the Nehru government led India into the First Indo-Pakistani War, and concluded military protection treaties with neighbouring Nepal, Bhutan, and Sikkim, striving to fill the power vacuum created by British withdrawal from the South Asian subcontinent and expand India's strategic advantage in South Asia. Because of its strategic importance to India, the Indian government also advocated the policy of inheriting the colonial era, establishing a buffer zone in Tibet, and indirectly controlling Tibet by sending troops to consolidate the security of the Himalayan defences. In 1951, the People's Republic of China entered Tibet through military operations and negotiations. In a letter to the Chinese government, the Indian embassy in China said: \"The Chinese army's invasion of Tibet has to be regarded as tragic. In 1959, after the Tibetan uprising, the 14th Dalai Lama fled to India, founded the Tibetan government of exile, advocated Tibetan independence. In 1960, the Premier of the State Council of China, Zhou Enlai, visited India, met with the Prime Minister of Nepal, proposed a negotiated solution to the border issue, no consensus. After 1960, Sino-Soviet relations began to deteriorate, and Sino-US relations were at a standstill because of the Korean War. India has good relations with the Cold War-era Soviet Union and the United States. In August 1962, the Cuban Missile Crisis erupted, causing tensions between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, and involuntary intervention in the Sino-Indian conflict.",

However, it is now known that when a cell divides, it produces a phenomenon of decreasing replication. As the length of the end of the DNA becomes shorter and shorter, affecting the accuracy of the original DNA, aging occurs. However, once cell aging occurs, this process is irreversible. And there's no way to replenish the end of the DNA. According to Ray Kurzweil, chief futurist at Google, advances in medical technology will extend lifespans by more than one year per person, nanobots will repair and replace cells, tissues and organs, reverse aging processes, and by consciousness transfer, allow people to survive through other bodies without being constrained by physical death, and by 2045, artificial intelligence will outperform humans by a billion times. According to the law of mass conservation (also known as the law of non-extinction of matter), the most basic materials and energies that make up matter cannot be created or extinguished, but can only be reassembled. Thus, from a materialistic perspective, when a human being dies, even if his or her remains are cremated and the ashes scattered over the ocean, they don't really disappear or disappear, but only the basic particles that make up the human body reassemble. According to fear management theory, human beings, fearing the disappearance of the self after death, tend in some way to make themselves symbolically ever present in other people's memories, group life or cultural customs, etc., and those who support the idea that the mind is ever-in-the-mind believe that even if the body has passed away, the mind can survive in such a way that death is not so frightening.",

The British Virgin Islands consist of four main islands: Totola, Virgin Gorda, Anegada, and West Van Dyke, as well as over 50 smaller islands and reefs, of which about 15 are uninhabited. Tortola is the largest island in the British Virgin Islands, about 20 kilometres long and 5 kilometres wide. The islands have a population of 28,000 and its capital, Rhode Island, is located on the island of Tokelau. Approximately 100 BC, the Arawak Indians were the first to migrate from South America to settle on the islands (but there is also evidence that the American Indians were active on the islands before 1500 BC). The Arawak Indians remained on the islands until the 15th century, when they were driven out by the Caribbean from the Lesser Antilles, and the Caribbean Sea was named for them. However, some historians disagree with the claim that \"the warring Caribbean drove the peaceful Arawaks out of the Caribbean\", arguing that this is a simplistic version of what the Europeans have always said, and that the truth behind it should be more complicated. In 1493, Columbus discovered the Virgin Islands on his second voyage to the Americas, becoming the first European to do so.",

In 772 BC, Assyrian king Assyria III became impotent, and during his reign there was a continuous internal rebellion and plague. Tiglath Parashar III was one of the most important monarchs of the New Assyrian Empire, and through his reforms, Assyria once again went from weakness to strength. One of the key elements of the reform was to limit the power of officials. During the reign of Hadrian III, officials were highly empowered, and could even launch battles without the king's knowledge. Local governors tend to form subordinates, some of whom are already independent or are clearly prone to independence. Tigrath Parashar replaced the governor with a chief executive named \"Bell-Pahatti\" in each province. The chief executive's power was smaller than that of the original governor, but it was still not enough to reassure Tiglath Palashal III. To further reduce the power of the local rulers, he began to reduce the size of the province. The newly conquered provinces were often administered by eunuchs. As a result, the number of provinces increased, and by 738 BC, there were as many as 80 known provinces; and the power of the governors of the provinces diminished, and many more were eunuchs. Tigerpalachar also allowed civilians to write directly to the king, to monitor the bureaucracy at all levels. Other reforms targeted the military. These measures included: the establishment of a standing army, supplied by the government, which encouraged the landless to join the army, thereby strengthening the army; the establishment of an army to guard and act as a backup force outside the main army directly under the king; and the conscription of the inhabitants of the conquered areas to fight for the Assyrians, thereby greatly strengthening the army (foreigners usually served only as infantry, cavalry, and chariot troops, or were recruited by the Assyrians).",

Broadly speaking, weather can include changes in the gas (the gaseous and ionic elements) in the entire galactic space, the continuous ejection of the star's corona, and the creation of an essentially very thin atmosphere throughout the solar system.

The emperor was torn between his mother and his ministers, and at one point he decided not to choose a burial place, and the ministers lay outside the monastery crying for a day. In the palace, Kenzong kept asking his mother, Empress Dowager Zhou, for help, but she refused. The Emperor's half-brother, Emperor Deng, asked Empress Dowager Qian to return to Beijing to mourn him, but was unsuccessful.

In the 1950s, the Kimma region used for-profit business invoices, not unified invoices issued by the Taiwan Province. Until January 1960, the Kinma side followed suit with the use of unified ballots, for the Kinmen and Lianjiang county governments to organize and manage separately.

Since the Solar System is thought to be formed from such a disk, I Canis Major and similar stars, such as Virgo and Beta Pictoris, may be candidates for exoplanets. Kinetic studies indicate that Ursae Majoris I is a member of an association known as the IC 2391 supercluster. Although the members of this group are not gravitationally bound to each other, all stars have roughly the same common motion. This suggests that they were born in the same place, perhaps initially forming an open cluster. Other members of this group include Alpha Pictoris, Beta Canis Major, and the open cluster IC 2391. The total number of possible members has been confirmed to be over 60. In astrology, it is believed that Pisces represents misfortune and shame.",

In April 1927, the Wuhan National Government ordered the pursuit of Zhang Tailei, Tsai and others. In the second half of 1927, Stalin's Chinese policy was criticized by Trotsky, who ordered the Chinese Communist Party to launch a series of armed uprisings in hopes of seizing power in some provinces, thus proving his Chinese policy correct.

This battle is sometimes referred to as the Battle of Huaiyin and the Battle of Huai'an. Like other conflicts between the two Communist parties after World War II, this one stemmed from Chiang Kai-shek\u2019s realization that his Kuomintang regime lacked sufficient troops or transportation capital to deploy its own troops to China\u2019s Japanese-occupied territories. He did not want the Communist Party, which had occupied most of China's rural areas, to further expand its territory by accepting the surrender of Japanese troops and controlling the Japanese occupation zone, so he ordered the Japanese army and the pseudo-army not to surrender to the Communist Party, to maintain their own forces, to \"keep order\" in the occupation zone, and, if necessary, to fight against the Communist Party, until the National Army finally arrived and completed its deployment. As a result, most members of the pseudo-government and the pseudo-military rejoined the army. However, most of these troops that were converted from the former state army to the pseudo-army were not Chiang Kai-shek's heirs, but were mainly composed of troops of warlords who were nominally under Chiang Kai-shek's rule before World War II, nominally only the Kuomintang, and mostly maintained their own independence or semi-independence. These warlords cared only about maintaining their own power, and when the Japanese invaders promised to keep them in power in exchange for their cooperation, they surrendered to the Japanese. After World War II, these warlords returned to the Kuomintang for the same reason. Chiang Kai-shek clearly found it difficult to eliminate these warlords as soon as they surrendered and returned to the Kuomintang, thus incriminating other factions within the army, and these pseudo-warlords could still help the Kuomintang gain more territory by deploying their own troops to complete the takeover and control.",

        "paragraph": "Some of the gaps are segments of tiny moons that have been cleared, such as Pan, probably many of which have not yet been discovered, and some of the rings are bound by gravity waves of some Shepherd Dog moons (such as the F-rings maintained by Prometheus and Pandora). Other gaps may be caused by resonance with the orbital periods of the larger moons, the presence of the Cassini node bound to the Milky Way, and more circular structures that produce spiral waves due to periodic perturbations by other moons. Data from the Cassini spacecraft show that Saturn's ring has its own atmosphere, independent of the planet itself. The atmosphere contains oxygen molecules (O2), which are produced by the Sun's ultraviolet rays interacting with the ice in the ring. The bonds between the water molecules are stimulated by ultraviolet light to produce chemical reactions that release and eject gases, especially O2. According to these atmospheric models, there are also H2, O2, and H2 atmospheres that are very sparse, but are strangely condensed around the ring, its thickness being only one atom. Saturn has a complex pattern in its brightness. In 1980, when Voyager 1 flew over Saturn, it was shown that the F-rings were composed of three braided rings with complex structures; it is now known that the outer two rings had protruding tumors, causing the illusion of weaving and clustering, while the third, less luminous, was inside them. The rings of Saturn may be very old, dating back to the formation of Saturn itself, and there are two main theories about the formation of Saturn's rings. One theory, which originated in the 19th century at the Roche limit, suggests that the ring was originally a Saturnian moon that fell into the Roche limit due to a decay in its orbit and was torn apart by tidal forces because it was not tight enough (see Roche limit), and this theory evolved into the theory that the moon collapsed when it was struck by an asteroid or comet.",

The tower system is similar to those of the Left Gate, but it's narrower, it's only 11.2 meters wide, it's 5.5 meters deep, and it's 12.2 meters high from the ramparts. There was no gate under the gate of the city of Dongbenmen, but a wooden square gate. The archery tower was built in the Qianlong period, with two archery holes, four holes per level on the north side and two holes per level on the east side.

The tower is 10.5 meters high, the other shapes and sizes are the same as the East Gate. The West Bend Tower, the Arch Tower, and the urn castle were demolished in 1952. It's right in the middle of Nangaki, the inner city of Beijing. It was built in the 17th year of the Ming dynasty, and was originally named after the central gate on the southern side of the Yuan Dynasty capital, Li Zhengmen, which was later changed to its present name.

The policy began with George Kennan's \"long telegram\" to the U.S. ambassador to the Soviet Union. After the end of World War II, relations between the Allies and the Soviet Union were strained, and Stalin established a number of pro-Soviet states around the Soviet Union to secure his own territorial dominance, such as the seizure of Poland. President Truman of the United States decided to take political countermeasures, limiting the socialist system of the Soviet Union. On March 12, 1947, Truman delivered a State of the Union address to the U.S. Congress, hoping that Congress would support democratic governments in Greece and Turkey. The U.S. began to provide military and economic assistance to countries that opposed socialist politics, a policy that formally proclaimed the U.S. foreign policy. The newly appointed U.S. Secretary of State, George Carter, Jr., adopted John F. Kennedy's \"X\" blockade plan, which was defined by Kennedy as a \"blockade of Soviet imperialism,\" and published in the July 1947 issue of Foreign Affairs. In his signature essay On the Causes of Soviet Behavior, Kanan proved the defectiveness of the socialist system, and argued that when the United States truly saw its own strength and accepted a dominant position, it was perfectly capable of limiting Russia's expansion back. Subsequently, the United States provided military and economic assistance to Turkey and Greece, owing to their geographical importance, jointly holding the Black Sea to the Mediterranean at the mouth of the Danube: if the Soviets controlled the area, the Soviet Black Sea fleet could sail freely into the Mediterranean, and the military threat would reach the entire Mediterranean region, threatening Italy, Spain, France, and the British-French North African colonies.",

Adult males with certain property qualify as citizens and can participate in the political life of the city-state. Public life in cities is an obligation, not a reward. Only by participating in the management of things in cities can you become a real person. The political activity of the city-state is the discussion of matters in the public assembly of the square, each citizen has an equal right to speak. This assembly is also the only legislature in the state. At rallies, citizens complete the functioning of power through speeches. But it can be manipulated by politicians, and it can lead to majority tyranny. Municipal offices were created either through direct elections or by drawing lots. The distribution of public office is achieved through rotating governments. Most ancient societies were monarchy-dominated states, usually subject to the doctrine of monarchy, but the nature and circumstance of their power varied from time to time and from place to place. The Roman Empire was the most representative of authoritarian states, and its central idea of government was the authority of the Roman Emperor, emphasizing the interests of the emperor and the government over the interests of the individual. Any decision on political matters must go back to the source of authority. The Senate represents this authority, used to give legitimacy to the government, but has a People's Chamber to represent male Roman citizens. The emperor's authority remains unchanged, and the system of power, led by the emperor, is constantly changing. China, at the time of the Western Zhou, was already a feudal monarchy, the head of state called Tianzi. Since the establishment of a unified centralized state in the Qin Dynasty, the emperor's monarchs have concentrated more power. This political system prevailed in China from then until today and in the Chinese-speaking countries that were influenced by the Chinese civilization.",

However, because the recruitment system destroyed the idea of the \"soldiers' separation\" of the early guard system, the cabinet had to subordinate the military power to the general, and the Ming Dynasty could not fully control the military power under the recruitment system, especially the relatively well-known \"relative family army\", which contributed to the consolidation of centralized power.

The largest of these is still Neptune I, discovered by William Russell on October 10, 1846, 17 days after the discovery of Neptune; the second moon, Neptune II (Lead), was discovered more than a century later. Neptune is the only irregular satellite with a planetary mass, i.e., it orbits in the opposite direction of Neptune's rotation and is inclined relative to the equator. This suggests that it was not formed at the same time as Neptune, but was captured by Neptune's gravitational pull. The second largest irregular moon in the Solar System is Phoebe, but it has only three tenths of the mass of Neptune. The capture of Neptune, which may have occurred some time after the formation of Neptune and its satellite system, was a devastating disaster for Neptune's primitive satellite system. Disturbing their original orbits, they collide with each other to form a rubble disk. Neptune's mass is large enough to reach a state of fluid static equilibrium, and it is able to retain a sparse atmosphere, forming clouds and haze. There are also seven regular moons in the orbit of Neptune, orbiting in the same orbit as Neptune and close to the equatorial plane; there are also some moons in the rings of Neptune, the largest of which is Proxima 8, which captures Neptune and regenerates from the previous debris disk after the orbit of Neptune has been rounded.

Because this is the most densely populated region of asteroids, estimated at as many as 500,000, the region is known as the main asteroid belt. The asteroid belt is formed by a group of stars in the primordial solar nebula \u2014 precursors of planets that are smaller than planets. Jupiter's enormous gravity hindered these stars from forming planets, and caused many of them to collide with each other at high energies, causing many debris and fragments. The asteroid's orbit around the Sun continued to be perturbed by Jupiter, forming an orbital resonance with Jupiter. The asteroids at these orbital distances (i.e., the Kirkwood Gap) are quickly swept into other orbits. The first three asteroids discovered in the main belt were Chitose, Mars, and Vesta, while the largest three were Chitose, Kenshin, and Vesta, with an average diameter of over 400 km; only one dwarf planet, Ceres, was found in the main belt, with a diameter of about 950 km; and the remaining asteroids were not large, some as large as dust.

The realistic elements of the work were gradually strengthened. The long novels Return to the Countryside, Mayor of Castlebridge, and Residents in the Woods, through the tragic encounters of the characters in the book, reflect the enormous changes in England's legal countryside after the industrialized forces penetrated the countryside. Tess of the Derby and Jude the Unknown are two of his representative novels, the former depicting the tragedy of the persecution and destruction of rural girls by the rich, and the latter a story of the destruction of the ideals of rural youth in industrial society. In his later years, he turned to poetry, writing the play The Ruler, denouncing the tyrant who brought misery to the people. His works are full of sympathy for the poor and unhappy lives of the people, profound revelations and criticisms of industrial civilization and morality, but his works also have some pessimistic and fatalistic themes.

Later, Constantine I moved the capital to Byzantium and named it New Rome, but historians prefer to call it Constantinople. Constantinople remained the capital of the empire until its end.

Emperor Theodosius I was the last emperor to rule a complete Roman empire, whose territory was increasingly eroded by adverse factors such as abuses of power, civil wars, barbarian invasions, military reforms, and economic decline. In 410 and 455, the western Roman city was invaded by Germanic tribes such as the Visigoths and Vandals.

Padus Plants are not called cherry blossoms in Chinese, but they are often called cherry trees in Japanese, such as ash-leaved plums are called cherry trees in Japanese, and cypresses are called dog cherry trees in Japanese. Most of the wild and cultivated varieties of cherry blossoms bloom in the Northern Hemisphere between March and April. For wild varieties, even the same fat, each tree has different genes, so even if they're planted in the same place, there are some differences in when they bloom. On the other hand, for cultivars, they are often planted to admire cherries, and because they are clones propagated by grafting or cutting, they are genetically homogeneous, so that every tree of the same cultivar blooms and withers in the same place. In addition, some wild varieties, such as the Greater Sakura, and the cultivars that they breed, are already blooming before the leaves open, giving a spectacular impression to those who appreciate them. Yoshino cherry blossom is one of the most popular cherry trees for viewing cherry blossoms, because in addition to these characteristics of simultaneous flowering and blooming before the leaves open, it can also produce large numbers of flowers, and quickly grow into a large tree. Many cultivars of mountain cherry blossoms are derived from complex interspecies hybridization on the basis of Oshima cherry, which is commonly used for ornamental purposes, usually reaching blooming status within a few days to two weeks after the blooming of Yoshino cherry blossoms. Cherry blossom time is thought to be influenced by global warming and urban heat island effects. According to a 1200-year-old Japanese cherry blossom record in Kyoto City, Japan, from 812 to the 19th century, the cherry blossoms were relatively stable, but after that, the cherry blossoms began to bloom faster, and in 2021, the earliest record of a 1200-year-old cherry blossom appeared.",

Hu advocated the use of white literature, arguing that \"white literature is the authenticity of Chinese literature, and a necessary tool of future literature, it can be asserted.\" In April 1918, he published The Construction of the Literary Revolution, which divided the eight propositions into four principles: one must speak and speak only. And the second is, what to say, what to say; how to say, how to say. And the third is to say what I say, and not what others say. The fourth is what the people of the time are, and what they say. In addition, he proposed a new historical view of literature, overturning the orthodoxy of ancient literature, and establishing vernacular literature as the canon of Chinese literature. On the other hand, to use the traditionally neglected vernacular as the only tool of all literature, to create Chinese literature. In the February 1917 issue of the New Youth, Chen published \"Literature Revolution\" and made three major claims: \"To overthrow the carved, aristocratic literature, to build a simple, lyrical national literature,\" \"To overthrow the obsolete, paved classical literature, to build a fresh, sincere literal literature,\" \"To overthrow the perfunctory, arduous forest literature, to build a clear, popular social literature.\"",

This ideology supports \"Taiwan is Taiwan\" and the two-state doctrine, arguing that Taiwan should follow the Republic of China's flag and constitution. The term \"Taiwan Independence\" was coined in 2015 by Tsai Dingqi, the general convenor of the Taiwan Alliance for the Defence of Taiwan, to distinguish it from \"traditional Taiwan independence\", which is a claim to establish an independent state entirely under the name of Taiwan, arguing that it does not belong to Taiwan independence. This political term is similar to the old term \"independence\", both of which were seen as independence by the People's Republic of China. The term was first coined in 2015 by Tsai Dingqi, and is used to distinguish between different political policies such as \"Taiwan Independence\" and \"Taiwan Independence\". In the Taiwanese independence movement, there are many different lines of argument, one of which is that Taiwan should be independent, establish its own constitution and national flag, and the national flag should be the Republic of Taiwan, which is called \"Taiwan Independence\" or \"traditional Taiwan Independence\". The term \"Taiwan independence\" is a euphemism for \"Taiwan independence\", which explicitly advocates open Taiwanese independence, the establishment of a sovereign independent \"Taiwan Republic\", and the abolition of the political system of the Republic of China.

Dutch has more phonemes than German, Russian, etc. In addition to the phonemes ch, lingo also has phonemes. Dutch is a SOV language, ordered main-subject-predicate. Most sentences in Dutch follow the second-order principle of verbs, meaning that the definite verb of a clause or sentence is placed in the second place, and has a separate component before it, used as the subject of the clause. In most sentences, the main order (not inverted) is: subject-limited verb-indirect adjective-determined adjective of time and place-direct adjective-predicate-non-predicate part. In sentences, the second syllable of the verb no longer applies, occurring in reverse (as in German), reversing the SOV syntax. In Dutch grammar, the sex of a noun determines whether it is modified or assigned to its prefixes, adjectives, and pronouns. Sex in Dutch is a very complex topic, because depending on the geographical area and the speaker, there are two types of sex in Dutch: the first is universal and neutral; the second is trisexual (negative, positive and neutral). The Dutch language of the Kingdom of the Netherlands belongs to the first category, i.e. the two sexes; the Dutch language of Belgium (also known as Flemish) retains the three sexes. Traditionally, Dutch nouns were identical to German, Icelandic, and so on, and continued the three genders of the Germanic language: negative, positive, and neutral. Both the negative and the positive (or universal) nouns use the definite de, which contains more than half of the Dutch nouns; the neutral nouns use the definitehet, which contains a small part of the Dutch nouns.",

The idea of a smart city originated with the idea of a \"smart Earth\" proposed by IBM, and similar concepts have existed before, such as digital cities. In November 2008, at the beginning of the global financial crisis of 2007-2012, IBM launched the Smart Earth: The Next Generation Leaders Agenda, a thematic report published in New York that called for the full use of the next generation of information technology in all industries. Specifically, the idea of \"intelligence\" is to enable mankind to manage the state of production and life in a more subtle and dynamic way through the application of a new generation of information technologies, by embedding and equipping sensors in various objects of the production and life systems such as power systems, water systems, transportation systems, buildings and oil and gas pipelines in every corner of the world, connecting the Internet of Things to the Internet, integrating human society and physical systems, and then integrating the Internet of Things through supercomputers and cloud computing. Since then, this idea has been embraced around the world, as a point of economic growth in response to the financial tsunami. At the same time, the development of smart cities is considered to contribute to promoting the sustainable development of the city economy, society and the environment, coordinating resources, alleviating the \"big city disease\" and improving the quality of urbanization.

The United Nations was established in 1945 after the end of World War II, replacing the League of Nations to prevent war and provide a platform for dialogue between nations. The United Nations has established a number of subsidiary bodies to implement its purposes. The United Nations is headquartered in Manhattan, New York City, United States, and is mandated to exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction. Other major offices are located in Geneva, Nairobi and Vienna. As of 2018, the United Nations has 193 member states, including all non-contested sovereign states except Vatican City State. In the century before the United Nations was founded, many international treaty bodies and conferences were established to regulate conflicts between nations, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907. The original and complete idea of creating a new world organization dates back to the United States State Department in 1939. U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt first used the word \"\" United Nations \"\" to describe allied nations. On 6 January 1946, the first session of the United Nations General Assembly (51 representatives attended.

Police forces are generally divided into two systems: patrol police and criminal police, which are then further subdivided into various ranks and categories of work. The London Police Department is the world's first urban police department to use modern policing to maintain law and order, and the Hong Kong Police Department is the first police department in Asia to use modern policing to maintain law and order. Most countries and regions have separate police and military forces, independent of each other, each with its own professionalism. In France and the People's Republic of China, in addition to the police, members of the army or a separate national gendarmerie are also responsible for handling or coordinating security matters. In a few areas, the police became auxiliary armed units of the army. In countries with no army or no military command, the police are the only armed forces that can be directly deployed by the local government or authority, such as Iceland and Panama. In dictatorships and totalitarian states, the police function as an instrument of the dictator to suppress dissent, and there may be police systems such as secret police and religious police. Military police, also known as gendarmes, are those who are responsible for maintaining military order in military camps and areas, and in countries and territories with gendarmes, gendarmes can maintain military order under military law, prosecute military personnel, and assist military prosecutors in military law cases. Some states and territories also have a national constitutional army, stationed in fortresses, borders, important institutions, armed with heavy weapons of infantry rank, and with law enforcement powers over the population. The term \"Chinese police\" first appeared about 1900 years ago, in October 1894.",

Already in the 3rd century BC, the founder of the Persian Sassanid dynasty, Artaxerxes I, built a defensive fortress in what is now the city of Kerman, named after himself, Behdashir, the prototype of what is now the city of Kerman. After the Battle of Nahavand in 642, Persia was conquered by the Arab Empire, and the city fell to the Muslims. Initially, the city was isolated from the outside world, allowing only the Wahhabis and Zoroastrians to settle, but in 698 the Wahhabis disappeared, and by 725 most of the city's inhabitants were Muslims. In the 8th century, the city was famous for Kashmiri wool scarves and other textiles. After the decline of the Abbasid dynasty in the late 9th and early 20th centuries, the city came under the control of the Tahrir, Safavid, Ottoman, and Byzantine dynasties, and was conquered by the Mahmoud Sultan of Ghazni in the late 10th century. According to some accounts, in the 10th century Behdahir was renamed Kerman.",

Since the Second Shang Dynasty, only members of the royal family were allowed to take office.

According to the Chronicle of the Sun Yat-sen, the Ryukyu people were descendants of the Emperor. God sent the goddess Amamikiyo and the male god Shinerikiyo to humanity, bearing three sons and two daughters, as the ancestors of the Ryukyu people. The eldest son is the descendant of the heavens; the second son is the ancestor of the princes; the third son is the ancestor of the people. In fact, in early Ryukyu, there was no concept of a king, and the heads of the various regions called themselves priests, and were sometimes honored with the titles \"Lord of the World\" and \"Lord of the World\". According to the Okinawan scholar Ipopuyu, \"Aji\" is a transliteration of \"Lord\" (alji) in the Ryukyu language. The first settlers in the area came in the 12th century, and they built several castles and fought against each other. Afterwards, the king unified Ryukyu.

In 1869, the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Qing dynasty concluded a treaty establishing diplomatic relations, which were formally implemented in 1871. During the Eight Nations Campaign of 1900, Austria-Hungary was one of the participating nations. On October 6, 1913, the Austro-Hungarian Empire recognized the Republic of China, and the only Chinese ambassador to the Austro-Hungarian Empire at that time was Shen Ruilin. In 1938, Nazi Germany annexed Austria, and the Republic of China and Austria again broke off diplomatic relations. After World War II, the Republic of China and Austria briefly established diplomatic missions. After the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, the Austrian embassy in Taiwan was closed. Diplomatic relations between the Republic of China and Austria were not interrupted until the establishment of diplomatic relations between the People's Republic of China and Austria on 28 May 1971. In 1964, the People's Republic of China and Austria signed an exchange of letters, the Mutual Commercial Representative Office.

The forms of these materials include ionized gases, atoms, and molecules, as well as cosmic dust and cosmic rays. They fill the intergalactic space, and they successfully integrate into the surrounding intergalactic space. Energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation occupies an interstellar radiation field of the same volume. Interstellar matter, whether it's atoms, molecules, or ions, has different phases depending on the temperature and density of the material. Interstellar matter consists primarily of hydrogen, followed by helium, and is composed of trace amounts of carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen relative to hydrogen. The thermal pressures of these phases are roughly in equilibrium with each other. Magnetic fields and turbulent motions also provide pressure for interstellar matter, which is usually more important than thermal pressure. By Earth's standards, all phases of interstellar matter are extremely fragile. Cold, dense interstellar matter, the main components of which appear in the form of molecules, has a density of 106 molecules per cubic millimeter (1 million molecules per cubic millimeter). Thermal, diffuse interstellar matter is mainly ionized atoms, with densities as low as 10\u20134 ions per cubic millimeter. Relative to the Earth's sea level, about 1019 molecules per cubic centimetre, and 1010 molecules per cubic centimetre (10 billion molecules) in the Highly Vacuum Laboratory, are the densities of extreme vacuum. By mass, 99% of interstellar matter is of various types of gas, and only 1% of it is dust particles, known in astronomical terms as metals. By mass, 70 percent is hydrogen, 28 percent is helium, 1.5 percent is heavy elements. In interstellar matter, hydrogen and helium are mainly the result of protonuclear synthesis, while heavy elements are the result of quenching during stellar evolution.",

It is also known as the \"Left-Wing\" or \"Left-Wing\", and the \"Left-Wing\" or \"Left-Wing\" or \"Left-Wing\" as well as the \"Left-Wing\" or \"Left-Wing\" or \"Left-Wing\" as well as the \"Left-Wing\" or \"Left-Wing\" as well as the \"Left-Wing\" or \"Left-Wing\" as well as the \"Left-Wing\" or \"Left-Wing\" as well as the \"Left-Wing\" or \"Left-Wing\" as well as the \"Left-Wing\" or \"Left-Wing\" as well as the \"Left-Wing\" or \"Left-Wing\" as well as the \"Left-Wing\" or \"Left-Wing\" as well as the \"Left-Wing\" or \"Left-Wing\" as well as the \"Left-Wing\" or \"Left-Wing\" as well as the \"Left-W The inscription on the left reads, \"It is a great honour for me to be here,\" and the inscription on the right reads, \"It is a great honour for me to be here.\" It is necessary to discuss the meaning of \"enthronement\" in the book of Spring and Autumn, and the following characteristics can be derived from the preliminary analysis. First, the Eight Enthronements of Spring and Autumn are recorded seven times in the Spring and Autumn Equinox, the first spring of the new reign of Lu. The exception is the Spring and Autumn Chronicle: \"Summer, June, July, the death of the Duke (of the previous year's death, Duke Lu Zhao) until the end of the reign of Emperor Qianhu. Pentecost, the emperor ascends the throne. The jubilee of the accession of Louis was a special occasion. It can be seen that there is a close relationship between the Enthronement and the Neolithic, that the beginning of the Neolithic and the Enthronement coincide in time. Secondly, there are the Four Kings of Lu, who are absent from the Book of Spring and Autumn, and the year of Spring and Autumn is the year of their accession to the throne. For example, the enthronement of Ruin was not recorded, but the Spring and Autumn Chronicle was chronicled in the form of \"a certain year of Ruin\" during his reign. Thirdly, the \"enthronement\" time of the new emperor recorded in Spring and Autumn is not the time when the new emperor is established or when the new emperor actually begins to reign. The old man died, the new man was confirmed, and he was actually in power. However, the next year, the first January of the new millennium, he was \"appointed\" to the throne.",

Du's strategic plan consisted of three steps: the first step was the New Sixth Army and the 52nd Army in southern Liaoning, taking advantage of the weakness of the Communist army in front of them, and rapidly taking the city of Andong. Then the whole vast area of southern Liaoning was adjacent to the garrison of the brigade of the Soviet Union, the east to the coast of the Yellow Sea did not need military defence, the duck-green river and the confrontation with North Korea, could greatly save military forces; in the second step, with the forces of the new sixth army, the 52nd army, the Youth Army 207th division together with the forces of three armies occupied Jian and Linjiang, thoroughly eliminated the communists in Nanchang; finally, the new army of Changchun, the 60th army of Yongji, the 71st army of Shiping, and other units to withdraw troops, with the forces of five armies from Jilin City to bypass right hook and bypass to capture Harbin.",

Most of the collapsed mass concentrated in the center, forming the Sun, the rest flattened and formed a protoplanetary disk, followed by planets, satellites, meteors, and other small solar system bodies. This is a widely accepted model of the nebula hypothesis, first proposed in the 18th century by Emanuel Swedenborg, Emanuel Kant, and Pierre Simon, Marquis of Lapland. Its subsequent development was intertwined with many other scientific fields, including astronomy, physics, geology, and planetary science. Since the advent of the space age in the 1950s, and the discovery of extrasolar planets in the 1990s, this model has been challenged and refined in the process of explaining new discoveries. Since its formation, the Solar System has undergone considerable change. Many moons are formed from a disk of gas and dust surrounding their parent stars, while others are believed to have been captured, or from massive collisions (e.g., Earth's moon). Interstellar collisions continue to occur today, and are at the center of the evolution of the Solar System. The positions of the planets are constantly shifting, and some of the planets are already aligned with each other. Thought about the origin and fate of the world can be traced back to the earliest known writings; however, for most of that time no one attempted to link such a theory to the existence of the Solar System, for the simple reason that people at the time generally did not believe that the Solar System as we now know it existed. The first step toward the theory of evolutionary formation of the Solar System was the widespread acceptance of the Sun's center, which puts the Sun at the center of the system, putting the Earth in orbit around it.",

After several years of anti-Tang warfare, Silla finally gained control of the Korean Peninsula south of the Datong River. North of Datong River was occupied by the Tang Dynasty and the later rising Bohai State. On December 16, 755 (Tuesday), Emperor Xuanzong's fourteenth day of the month of November, the envoys of Fanyang, Pinglu, and the Three Rivers of the East, An Lushan, raised an army in Fanyang, which is known as the Anshi Rebellion. During the 5th Dynasty, Liaoning was gradually occupied by the southern Chetan, and after the Tang Dynasty, it became the core part of the Liaoning Dynasty and the birthplace. On May 11, 1922, Xu Zhengchang issued a presidential decree, dismissing Zhang Xuanlin from his posts as the three provincial envoys, the provincial envoy to Mongolia, and the military governor of Fengtian. However, on May 12, Zhang Zhaolin declared the independence of the Eastern Three Provinces. Later, the Fengtian Provincial Assembly elected Zhang as the Commander-in-Chief of the Eastern Three Provinces and the Governor of Fengtian Province, Sun Lixiang, Wu Junhui as the Deputy Commander-in-Chief, and Zhang Shaolin began to take full control of Fengtian Province. At that time, the provincial capital was Shenyang, and the province was divided into fifty-nine counties. In 1931, the Nineteen Eighth Incident broke out, and within days the entire province fell. On March 1 of the following year, Japan established Manchukuo. The province is divided into three provinces: Andong, Fengtian and Jinzhou. After the establishment of the Pseudo-Manchukuo, Japan leased the territory to the Pseudo-Manchukuo. In 1937, a new lease agreement was concluded between Japan and Manchuria, which transferred the administrative authority of Manchuria's Manchurian dependent territories to the Guangdong Province, but kept Guangdong Province outside the nominally independent Guangdong Province until the end of World War II, when it returned to Liaoning Province after the surrender of Japan. In September 1945, after the division of the northeastern region into nine provinces, the administrative division of the province was changed to Liaoning (province-level Shenyang) and Liaoning (province-level Liaoning). The city of Shenyang was elevated to the status of a municipality in June 1947.",

In the 5th century BC, after the Peloponnesian War, the ancient Greek mainland gradually declined, but its cultural influence continued to expand, and in the 3rd century BC, Alexander the Great conquered Egypt and Persia, established a great empire across Eurasia and Africa, spreading Greek culture to Asia and Africa. In 27 B.C., ancient Rome arose, formed the Roman Empire, became a great empire that ruled Europe, Western Asia and North Africa, and the Mediterranean became its inland sea. The Apennine Peninsula was the political and economic center of Europe at the time. After the 1st century, Christianity began to spread in Rome. In 313, Christianity was declared a Roman state, gaining dominance in Europe. In the late 3rd century, the Roman Empire gradually weakened.

The following year, production of the aircraft began, with 175 participants, 70 of whom were engineers, taking three years, and the aircraft was delivered on April 20, 1951. The cyclone was originally developed to meet the needs of the Navy, but was eventually adopted by the United States Air Force's SAGE system. The Navy, which spends millions of dollars a year on the project, has lost interest. In 1949, the Soviet Union's first atomic bomb was successfully detonated, and the U.S. Air Force responded, eventually capturing the cyclone. The wind turbine's initial operating speed was only 20 kilowatts per second, and it was practically still a long way away. The problem is mainly with the use of the main memory, the Williams tube. To solve the problem, Forrester tried using a spiral tape instead, which was not very successful, and eventually chose a magnetic core memory. As a result, the wind turbine's calculation speed was increased to twice that of its predecessor (40 kbit/s). Due to the use of magnetic core memory, the speed of the wind turbine became the world's fastest at the time. Add eight microseconds, multiply by 25.5 microseconds, divide by 57 microseconds. The reading time of 8,500 microseconds using a drum storage device is only 8 microseconds after the core memory is replaced. The speed of the cyclone made the development of the SAGE system possible, and production of the AN/FSQ-7 began.",

Europeans arrived in the San Francisco Bay Area in 1542, and the San Francisco area became part of Spain's Upper California Territory in the 16th century. The Spanish general Don Gaspar de Portola led his men to explore the San Francisco Bay Area in 1769. On 28 March 1776, the Spanish explorer Juan Bautista de Anza selected two building sites, one for military purposes and the other for missionary purposes, but the actual construction was supervised by two of Anza's companions, Lieutenant Jos\u00e9 Joaquin Moraga and Francisco Pal\u00f3u, a Franciscan priest.",

After the end of World War I, the isolationist United States began to reduce the size of its federal army. Congress passed the National Defense Act of 1920, which reorganized the U.S. Army, defining its three components: the Regular Army (the Army's reserve force), the Army National Guard, and the Army Reserve. The United States began using aircraft after 1910, initially under the command of the Army. In 1947, after World War II, the United States Army Air Forces formally separated from the United States Army and became the independent United States Air Force. The U.S. Army also participated in the Korean War and the Vietnam War. With U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War no longer supported by the people, the Volunteer Army Project (VOLAR) began in the late 1970s, seeking to abolish the compulsory military service.

On October 27, 2016, the Communist Party of China's Sixth Plenary Meeting of the Eighteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China merged the \"supervisory organ\" with power organs (the People's Congress and its Standing Committee), administrative organs (the People's Government), judicial organs (the People's Court and the People's Procuratorate) for the first time, and upgraded it from a constituent department of the People's Government to a parallel state organ. For this reason, the CPC Central Committee decided to establish the Leading Group for the Pilot Work on the Deepening of the National Supervisory System Reform, and Wang Qishan, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, served as the head of the group. On November 7, 2016, the General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued \"On the Pilot Program for the Development of the State Supervisory System Reform in Beijing, Shanxi and Zhejiang Provinces\", which determined the thinking of the supervisory system reform.",

The North American Free Trade Agreement reopened negotiations, and the first round of negotiations officially kicked off in August 2017. On August 27, 2018, the United States and Mexico reached a preliminary agreement in principle to renew the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA): On September 30, 2018, the United States and Canada announced that they had reached a consensus on a new agreement: Agriculture has been a contentious issue since the original NAFTA negotiations, and any free trade agreement signed under the World Trade Organization framework raises similar issues. Agriculture is the only part not to have been negotiated in tripartite consultations, with three separate agreements being negotiated bilaterally. Agreements between Canada and the United States contained restrictions on agricultural products and tariff quotas, mainly sugar, dairy products, and poultry; agreements between Mexico and the United States allowed phased trade liberalization. The overall effect of the Mexico\u2013Mexico Agricultural Agreement is controversial, as Mexico does not have the infrastructure investment needed to compete, such as a complete rail and road transportation system, which puts the country's poor in a more difficult environment. In fact, Mexico's agricultural exports increased by an average of 9.4 percentage points annually from 1994 to 2001, compared to imports which increased by only 6.9 percent. Mexico's corn production increased after the NATFA was implemented, but the domestic demand for corn exceeded what was available, making imports more urgent than Mexico's initially agreed agricultural quotas.",

Allied military operations in Normandy progressed smoothly, and by early August they had achieved the objectives of the Grand Duchy's campaign, gaining control of much of the Normandy region. Following the fall of Normandy to the Allies, Allied troops approached the original French capital, Paris. On 19 August, the French Resistance in Paris responded by launching an uprising to drive out German troops stationed in Paris. Among them, the former Vichy France, which had a police force of 10,000, also joined the uprising under the banner of the Resistance. The Germans, on the other hand, had about 20,000 regular troops stationed in Paris, 5,000 of whom were in the city. The two armies fought fiercely in the streets. Due to the heavy casualties of the French resistance, the insurgents' fighting power and weaponry were far inferior to those of the trained regular German forces, as well as inadequate supplies and ammunition, the insurgents sent envoys to the regular Allied forces to seek help. However, according to the Allied plan, the Allied forces intended to bypass Paris after the Normandy landings and attack Germany directly, avoiding entering the city for street fighting, so the Allied generals in command of the front refused to seek the help of the French guerrillas. However, under the influence of Charles de Gaulle, the supreme decision-maker of the Allied forces, the plan was changed, and the French 2nd Armoured Division was sent to attack Paris; on 24 April, the leading elements of the L'Aquilae Division entered Paris and engaged the Germans; on 25 April, the French issued an ultimatum to the German commander of the garrison, Lieutenant General Dietrich von Kurtitz.",

There are also specialty plastics for special purposes, like medical plastics, conductive plastics, high-temperature plastics, etc. Biodegradable plastics degrade naturally when exposed to certain environmental or biological conditions in nature. Specific conditions may include exposure to the sun, exposure to water or moisture, bacteria, enzymes, wind abrasion and other environmental conditions (environmental decomposition), or biological conditions such as predators, pests or insect attacks. Some types of plastic decomposition require that the plastic be exposed to sunlight, and some decompose in landfills or compost. Starch particles have been added to plastics to accelerate their decomposition, but they are still unable to completely decompose the plastic. Some researchers have used genetic engineering to modify a bacterium to make plastics that are completely biodegradable, but this material (polyhydroxybutyrate) is still very expensive by 2013. There are also companies that have developed biodegradable additives to accelerate the decomposition of plastics. Natural plastics include natural rubber, latex (which can be used to make gum), insecticides, and nitrified fibers, but most of today's plastics are produced by the petrochemical industry. The limited availability of oil and the problem of global warming have led to the development of bioplastics, plastics made from renewable sources of biomass, such as vegetable oil, corn starch, peas starch, etc. The world's annual consumption of soft packaging is estimated at 12.3 million tons, of which 32.7 million tons are bio-based. Some plastics are semi-crystalline polymers with half crystalline and half amorphous chemical structures, so they have both melting points (the temperature at which intermolecular forces are overcome) and one or more glass conversion temperatures (the temperature at which local molecular elasticity is significantly increased).",

At the same time as spreading Catholic doctrine, missionaries also introduced a great deal of Western science and technology. Some Chinese physicians and emperors accepted scientific and technological knowledge, but were largely unaffected by it.

On September 23, 63 BC, Octavian was born in a small place called \"the head of the ox\" on Mount Palatine in Rome, near the Piazzale Roma. He inherited his father's name Gaius Octavius. In September 45 BC, Caesar the Great adopted Jadwiga and designated her heir by will. In March 44 BC, when Caesar was assassinated, Octavian was in the army of Albania. He was eighteen years old, often underestimated by his opponents. However, he repeatedly emphasizes himself as Caesar's son to arouse people's affection for him (so much so that he deliberately omits Octavian to call himself Gaius Julius). Anthony accuses Housewife of being a child molester and of killing Caesar in order to have him adopted. The Roman historian Suetonius analyzed Antony's accusation that he was trying to throw dirty water at Octavian, because Antony had also insulted Octavian's relatives' ancestors. After Caesar's death, Octavian marched to Italy, where he recruited and expanded Caesar's old army. After arriving in Rome, he discovered that the capital was in the hands of the republicans Marcus Junius Brutus and Cassius, who had murdered Caesar. After a tense standoff, he formed a military dictatorship with Marc Antony and Caesar's important colleague Marcus Emilios Rebida, known as the \"Third Coalition\". They then began to clean up the Senate, enslaving the property of 300 senators and 3,000 knights, which was not only \"cleansing\" the place, but a large portion of the unclaimed property was used to expand the army.",

And that breakthrough would benefit his social practice. \"The first generation of leaders is the leader who is determined to hold the future of the country in his own hands; the second generation of leaders is the leader who is able to satisfy the people's desire for life, and life is not so easy to satisfy.

In terms of the natural environment, burning natural gas is cleaner and produces fewer greenhouse gases than fossil fuels like oil and coal. To get the same amount of heat, burning natural gas produces 30 percent less carbon dioxide than burning oil, 45 percent less than burning coal. Combined cycle electricity using natural gas is the cleanest fossil fuel energy available. This technology is being widely adopted where gas can be obtained at a reasonable cost. Fuel cell technology may eventually provide a cleaner alternative to converting natural gas into electricity, but it is not yet price-competitive. Similarly, natural gas is said to peak around 2030, 20 years later than oil. Global gas supplies will run out in the mid-1980s.",

In addition to the above-mentioned technical issues, organ transplantation in some places may also raise ethical controversies because of the source of the organ donor, so as noted above, in general, if the patient is not dead or suspected to be dead, it must be performed after the legal examination has been completed, and after the prosecutor has determined that no further examination is necessary.

In the final years of the Yuan Dynasty, political corruption, unremitting natural disasters, unremitting civil unrest, the civilian Zhu Yuanzhang joined the Red Scarf Army, and rose to prominence among them, following the occupation of Hozhou by Guo Zhixing. After the death of Guo Zi-Xing, Zhu Yuanzhang was promoted to the rank of deputy commander-in-chief of the left by Han Lin, the then rebellious King of the Koming Dynasty, and his troops occupied Chuzhou, Wazhou, etc., and eventually captured Jiuqing (now Nanjing City), adopting the policy of \"high walls, plentiful food, loosely called the king\" suggested by Zhu Liang. In 1364, Zhu Yuanzhang proclaimed himself King of Wu, establishing the Western Wu Dynasty. In 1368, Zhu Yuanzhang ascended the throne as Emperor on the fourth day of the first month of the lunar calendar, and became known as Daimyo (\u5927\u660e), uniting the whole country. At the beginning of the new millennium, the world was stable, the national power was growing rapidly, and history called the reign of Hongwu. After Zhu Yuanzhang's death, his grandson Zhu Yunzhang succeeded to the throne, but he was defeated in the Siege of Yanjing by Zhu Yuanzhang's fourth son, Zhu Di, who had been stationed in Yanjing. After Zhu Di ascended the throne, he moved the capital to Juntianfu (present-day Beijing), changed the bureaucratic post of Beiping to Beizhi, and the former bureaucratic post of Beijing to Tianfu, and renamed Nanjing. After the Three Great Conquests of the Han Dynasty, to settle internal and external problems, Japan destroyed the enlightened plan of Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI to invade Korea by crossing the sea, however, because of the dispute over the country, the emperor gradually neglected the dynasty, the history called the Wanren neglected the government, while the Donglin Party dispute also brought political chaos, and the real power of women began to rise. The day is marked by a turning point in the day-to-day life of the village. The Ming Dynasty encompassed the Han Dynasty.

Under low-voltage fluorescent lamps, high-voltage discharge tubes, and neon lights, it emits a distinctive reddish-orange color. Plutonium is also used in plasma tubes and refrigeration equipment, with few commercial applications. Its commercial sources are mainly distilled from liquid air. Because air is the only source, plutonium is more valuable than helium. Plutonium is the second lightest inert gas, after helium. It emits orange-red light in a vacuum tube. It also has the smallest liquid temperature range of any element: 24.55 K to 27.05 K (-248.45 \u00b0C to-245.95 \u00b0C, or 415.21 \u00b0F to 410.71 \u00b0F). On a unit volume basis, it has a cooling capacity that's 40 times higher than liquid helium, three times higher than liquid hydrogen. Of all inert gases, plutonium discharge is most intense at equal voltages and currents. The color of plutonium in vacuum discharge tubes is orange-red, visible to the naked eye, due to the presence of many radionuclides within this range. It also has a bright green spectral line, but is generally not recognizable, and can only be detected by spectrophotometry. There are two common applications of fluorescent lighting in everyday life. The bulbs are generally smaller and operate at voltages between 100 and 250 volts. Lamps are often molded into various shapes and characters as signs, and are used in architecture and the arts. It is often used in advertisements for neon lights, emitting bright orange-red light. Although neon lights of other colors are often referred to as fluorescents, they use different types of inert gases or fluorescents of different colors. Other applications include: liquid and gaseous plutonium are relatively expensive, and the price of liquid plutonium can exceed 55 times that of liquid helium.",

It is believed that the treaty marked the beginning of normalized Chinese diplomacy, but in fact, until the establishment of the prime minister's office, the Qing dynasty treated foreign affairs with the concept of feudal lordship, and endeavored to seek foreign submission in exchanges (e.g., with Machiavelli), unlike diplomacy in the modern sense. With the decline of the Qing dynasty and the corruption of the government, as well as foreign aggression, starting with the Treaty of Nanjing, the Qing dynasty began to sign a series of unequal treaties with foreign countries. These unequal treaties, either demanding land expropriation or demanding compensation, led the Qing dynasty from a powerful Eastern empire gradually to a semi-colonial state, which, in the face of repeated blows, ultimately led to the overthrow of the Qing dynasty. Nearly 200 treaties were signed by more than fifty republics before, during and after the Qing Dynasty. Although a considerable part of them were treaties degrading the state (such as the Sino-British Treaty of Tianjin), there were also treaties that promoted the dignity of the state at the time of its glory (such as the Treaty of Nebuchadnezzar). But from the beginning to the end, the Qing dynasty government never forgot its prestige as a \"heavenly dynasty great power.\" Even when they sign some unequal treaties, they don't forget to hang their heads, to see themselves as heavenly, to see each other as little countries that are inspired by heavenly morality and dignity, that owe a debt of gratitude to heaven. The Great Purge Law, compiled in 1646, retained the provisions of the Great Ming Law relating to \"the smuggling of foreigners and the violation of the law of the sea\".",

Of the remaining 90,000 soldiers, only about 10,000 survived, of whom 32,000 were killed, and most of the remaining tens of thousands died of starvation or disease during the retreat. The main cause of such heavy losses was the departure from reality and irresponsible operational planning and evasion of command responsibilities of Commander Mutaguchi, which is still regarded as a standard military disaster; in Japan, the use of the Inpal to describe someone doing something has become synonymous with \"recklessness\". In August 1942, the South Vietnamese Army launched an offensive against India, known as Operation 21 in addition to recruiting supporters in Burma and elsewhere who hoped to use the opportunity of the Great East Asia War to achieve Indian independence. The initial plan for Operation 21 was to use the main force of the 15th Army's 18th Division, with a combined strength of about two divisions, to bring troops to India and Burma, with the main task of cutting off the Allies' Chiang Kai-shek route and weakening the country's war capabilities.

The Sanskrit word du\u1e25kha, commonly translated as \"pain\", or \"pain meaning\" (as one of the four meanings), from Sanskrit semantics, means \"anxious\" or \"unsettled\". It can correspond to modern descriptions of such emotions as \"pain,\" \"sadness,\" \"anxiety,\" \"discontent,\" and \"depression.\" To suffer means to suffer, to be unhappy, or to be miserable. The dissatisfaction of the heart is because of the circle of the heart, the circle without end, the thought without end, the thought of the past, the thought of the future, the thought of the present, and so on. Thoughts are stirred up by dissatisfaction, and at the same time, just like dissatisfaction, they often repeatedly feel what is lacking in life, that there are always places that are not right, that are not enough, and so they always want to make up for the shortcomings, to tidy up the situation so that they can have a little more comfort. Continuing to struggle and to concentrate is very annoying and painful; when one enjoys pleasure, one is afraid of losing it, and strives to seek more pleasure, or to preserve it; when one suffers, one strives to escape from suffering; and one is always dissatisfied, so that all one's activities do not always contain the components of dissatisfaction and pain. Buddhism believes that all existence is suffering. Life is full of suffering and joy, but what makes it hard to endure are the irregularities. Life, old age, and sickness are what all beings have to do, and the \"I\" is made up of five substances and spirits, but is a short-lived and accidental product, not a lasting, abiding, eternal thing.

He used telescopes to prove that the motion of the stars was negligible, but he found aberrations in the path of light, the motion of the Earth's axis, and he edited a table of 3222 stars. The most common measure of stellar parallax is the annual parallax, defined as the difference in angle between the positions of stars seen from Earth and the Sun, i.e., the difference in the diagonal of the average radius of a star in Earth's orbit around the Sun. One parsec (3.26 light-years) is defined as a distance of one arcsecond from the annual parallax. Annual parallax is a measurement of the position of a star that is observed at different times of the year, moving through Earth's orbit. Annual parallax measurements were the first reliable measurement of the closest distance to a star. The first successful measurement of stellar parallax was that of 61 Cygnus by Berserl in 1838. Due to the difficulty of measurement, by the end of the 19th century only about 60 stellar aberrations had been observed, and most of them were using filament microscopes. In the early 20th century, astronomical cameras using astronomical photographic plates accelerated this process. Automatic film measurements and more sophisticated computer technology in the 1960s made the pairing of stars more efficient. In the 1980s, photosensitive coupled components (CCDs) replaced photographic film, reducing uncertainty to a thousandth of an arcsecond. Stellar parallax is still the standard for calibrating other measurements (see Cosmic Distance Scale). Distance calculations based on stellar parallax require very precise measurements of the distance between the Earth and the Sun, now based on radar reflections from the planet's surface.",

The entire archipelago is divided into two administrative regions: the Kansai Region and the Jersey Region. Although often misunderstood as British (United Kingdom) territory, the Channel Islands are actually British royal territory, with sovereignty vested directly in the British Crown rather than part of the United Kingdom. The origins of the Channel Islands can be traced back to the 10th and 12th centuries, when the Duchy of Normandy ruled northern France and William I of Normandy conquered England and became King of England in 1066. Following the invasion of Normandy by King Philip II of France in 1204, the Channel Islands were not reclaimed by France, but continued to be controlled by the British. In 933, the islands were annexed by the Duchy of Normandy. In 1066, William the Conqueror of Normandy invaded and conquered England, becoming King of England. From 1204 onwards, the king of England lost part of the Norman continent to the Hundred Years' War. This meant that the Channel Islands were separated from the Duchy of Normandy and ruled by the King of England. The entire archipelago is divided into two administrative regions: the Kansai Region and the Jersey Region. The two administrative regions have been separated from each other since the late 13th century.

In addition, Noah Webster published a dictionary in the United States in 1828. In the 19th century, as public education and public libraries became more widespread, people had more opportunities to read books, and to interact in standard languages. Through trade and settlement, many people were exposed to foreign cultures, and with the influx of immigrants to the United States, foreign languages were introduced into English. After World War I and World War II, people from different backgrounds assembled in a short space of time, and social mobility intensified, invisibly narrowing the differences in social accents, particularly in the United States.

        "paragraph": "In astronomical dynamics, any orbit of an architecture under the standard hypothesis must be the shape of a conical tangent. The eccentricity of the cone section, the orbital eccentricity, is an important parameter in defining the orbital shape, and it defines the absolute shape. The eccentricity can be explained by the degree to which the shape deviates from the circle. Under the standard hypothesis, the eccentricity ( eccentricity, e {\\displaystyle e\\,\\!} ) is a strict definition of circles, ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas, and has the following values: the eccentricity e {\\displaystyle e} of an ellipse is the angle projection of the circle. For example, the eccentricity of Mercury is (0.2056), and a simple calculation of the inverse function of the sine yields a projection angle of 11.86 degrees, and then if you look at any circular object (such as a coffee cup seen from above) from that angle of inclination, the ellipse you see in your eye will have the same eccentricity. For example, Earth's current orbital eccentricity is 0.0167, but due to gravitational attraction between planets, it slowly becomes closer to zero over time, with a maximum value of about 0.05. (Please refer to (back up the page, in the Internet Archive)). In other measurements, Mercury's eccentricity (0.2056) is the highest of any planet in the Solar System.

The term \"class\" is used in many historical or political contexts to refer to \"multiple social groups with different identities, different statuses, wealth, forms of work, lifestyles, or other social, economic, or cultural factors, of different ideologies, etc.\" Most theories of class are based on the notion that societies are divided and antagonistic groups, and that the antagonisms between groups place societies in perpetual conflict. Marxism-Leninism holds that class has never existed, as the earliest primitive societies did not have the underlying factors for the emergence of class because of their excessively low productivity. It is generally assumed that the emergence of a class occurs after a certain degree of productivity has been attained, such as when a slightly larger society begins to have a division of labor phenomenon, and that it will inevitably die out in another extremely productive society (e.g., a capitalist society extinguishes a feudal society). The earliest classes occurred during the slavery era \u2014 the slaveholder class and the slave class. Marxism's most classical definition of class comes from Lenin: class, that is, such large groups as these, which have different positions in a certain historical system of social production, different relations of occupation of the means of production (which are largely prescribed by law), different functions in the organization of social labour, and thus different ways and quantities of the social wealth which they control.",

Practical testing found that the former approach was more conducive to maintaining road safety, and thus became the norm for automobile manufacturers.

In the early days of Wang Guo's study of law, they divided the rise of law into different periods. The King's family believed that the law began after the reign of the Zhou Emperor (see \"Kingdom of Heaven\" and \"Kingdom of Heaven\" respectively); the Guo family believed that the law began during the Warring States (see Guo Mojo's \"The Origin of the Golden Book of Law\"). The sequence of sentences, the sequence of Wuxian, also produced some overlap in later times.

Examples include Emperor Wei and Emperor Wei, Emperor Jin and Emperor Jin, Emperor Wei, Emperor Song, Emperor Liang and Emperor Liang, Emperor Chen, Emperor Sui, Emperor Tang and Emperor Taizong, Emperor Qing and Emperor Qing. Since the Song Dynasty's proxy learning was popular and the evaluation of Emperor Wu declined, the word \"\u6587\" was used to praise Emperor Wu, usually above the word \"\u6b66\". There are three main types of verbs: \"good\", \"bad\" and \"fair\". The term \"good\" and \"bad\" originated in the Western Zhou Republic, when Zhou Liang's tyranny was referred to as \"harsh\" and \"private\" due to the fact that \"the mouth of the people was more protective than the mouth of the river\".

In 1683, Admiral Shlong of the Fujian Naval Division fought against the Ming Zheng naval forces in Penghu, defeating Qing's army first and winning afterwards. After the defeat of Liu Guo-ken, Ming Zheng's internal unwillingness to resist the Qing army, and the defeat of King Cheng Kai-shek of Ping County, the Southern Ming Zheng regime collapsed, ending 22 years of rule in Taiwan. During the Three Domains Disturbance, the Qing Dynasty, which had entered the Central Plains shortly afterwards, had an unstable foundation and was constantly engaged in warfare with various Southern Ming forces, so Ming Zheng, who was on the side of Fujian Province, basically adopted a strategy of peaceful negotiation. In 1667, the Qing court sent General Kong Yuanzhang to Taiwan to mediate. He promised that if Zheng Zhen returned, he could seal the \"Eight Min Kingdoms\" and continue to rule the territory of Mintai, but Zheng Zhen refused. In 1669, Emperor Kangxi expelled Obai and began a pro-government policy. He then ordered the Ministry of Justice to make a major concession, allowing the Zheng clan to seize the territory, and to protect Taiwan for the rest of his life. Zheng Zhen compared himself to the king of North Korea, and said, \"If you can follow the example of North Korea, do not shave, call your servants tribute, honor great deeds, then you will be able to do so.\" Kangxi replied: \"If Zheng Jing remains in love with Taiwan, he can leave without thinking. As for not shaving more than North Korea, I wish to pay tribute, it is not acceptable. The North Koreans were never all foreigners, Zheng Xing was a Chinese,\" at which point Emperor Kangxi objected to Taiwan being a part of China, and effectively rejected the peace talks. On April 21, 1674, King Kangxi of the Qing Dynasty, Geng Jingzhong, raised an army against the Qing Dynasty and invited Cheng Jingzei to the expedition.

The truth of suffering and destruction is the method of suffering, to go through the so-called \"medieval\" life according to the principles of the Eightfold Path, and finally be able to liberate the flow of life and death.

In the six realms, the suffering of the lust realm is all three, the suffering of the color realm is bad and suffering, and the suffering of the colorless realm is suffering. Eight types of suffering are commonly used in Mahayana Buddhism: according to the Long Part of Southern Buddhism, the Buddha also divides \"pain\" into ten types (the \"Eleven Methods of Suffering\"): life, old age, death, sorrow, grief, pain, sorrow, anger, resentment, separation of love, unwillingness to seek, and finally, in general terms, \"five are pain.\" The Buddha referred to these sufferings as the \"five virtues of suffering,\" that is, the five negative virtues of suffering, the five virtues of burning, that is, the five virtues of suffering. Moreover, suffering refers to the Four Great Constellations, and once the Four Great Disorders are in place, they cause all sorts of diseases. The suffering of the six realms of reincarnation can refer to a place where one is born after one's death, or it can refer to a situation in which one's karma is suspended, or it can refer to a situation in which one's mind is awakened, and one feels the pain of a certain cycle of reincarnation.

As a result, the Allies decided to conduct military operations against Italy without affecting the main fronts, thereby giving the Royal Navy complete control of the Mediterranean, and greatly improving Britain's ability to communicate with Egypt, the Far East, the Middle East, and India. At the same time, the Germans forced the Soviets to withdraw their troops from the war to defend Italy and southern France, in favor of the Soviets' war against Germany. At the time, the Allies had even hoped that Italy's surrender would force the Germans to abandon Italy and retreat to the north. In September 1943, the Allies successfully landed on the Italian mainland from Sicily, and Italy surrendered to the Allies. The Allied success in capturing large numbers of German troops in Italy prevented the Germans from mobilizing additional troops to support Northwestern Europe. On July 10, 1943, a combined force of British, Canadian, and U.S. forces landed in Gela Bay and Syracuse, Sicily, with amphibious assault vehicles and paratroopers. Although the Germans were unable to stop the Allied occupation of Sicily, they managed to evacuate almost all German forces back to Italy. On 17 August, the last German troops from Sicily withdrew to Italy. Nonetheless, the Allies at least learned to land. On 3 September 1943, the Eighth Army launched Operation Bay City, landing in Calabria, Italy, and the Italian government surrendered to the British on 8 September. However, the Germans did not withdraw and decided to fight alone. On 9 September, the U.S. Fifth Army launched a major campaign of avalanches, but encountered a German heavy artillery counterattack when it landed at Salerno.",

In the 1990s, Intel invested heavily in new microprocessor designs and nurtured the fast-growing PC industry. During this period, Intel became the supply leader for PC microprocessors, and market orientation was dominated by aggressive and sometimes controversial marketing strategies, much like Microsoft dominated the development of the PC industry. The main competitors are Apple, AMD, NVIDIA, Samsung Electronics and TSMC. Intel's growth history can be divided into several distinct phases, described in the following sections. In 1955, \"Father of Transistors\" William Shockley left Bell Labs to found the Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory, which attracted many talented young scientists to join it. Soon, however, Shockley's management methods and eccentric behavior caused employee discontent. Among them, Robert Noyes, Gordon Moore, Julius Blank, Eugene Clay, Kim Hurney, Jay Laster, Sherton Roberts, and Victor Glick resigned, and in October 1957, they co-founded Sendo Semiconductor. Hungarian Andy Grove, who later made Intel a dominant player in the 1990s, joined the company in 1963 at the invitation of Gordon Moore. Due to the rapid development of Sendo semiconductor, internal organizational management and product issues have become increasingly imbalanced.",

Natural geography focuses on natural environments, such as the formation processes of landforms, phenomena related to climate, soil, water, ecology, and vegetation, and their interrelationships. Human geography focuses on man-made environments, such as how humans colonize, manage, and view space.Natural geography is a natural science that specializes in exploring patterns of change in nature (rock, atmosphere, hydrology, and biosphere), and can be classified into the following categories: Biogeography and landscape ecology Climate and prehistoric climateology Oceanography and coastal geography Environmental geography and environmental management Geodesy Landforms Paleogeography and Quaternary science Hydrology and hydrology Soil and soil geography Climate glaciology and frozen soil Chemical geography Seismology and volcanology Human geography deals with the interactions between humans and the environment, and studies the relationship between humans and communities, culture, and economics, thus falling into the category of social sciences. Although there is little mention of human geography and landforms (see natural geography), human activity is certainly mountainous and riverous, with regional climates (such as deserts unsuitable for cultivation). Therefore, when discussing human geography and not neglecting natural factors such as landforms and climate, environmental geography connects the two.",

The Sumerians believed that the entrance to Kur was in the eastern part of the Zagros Mountains, and that every soul needed to pass through the seven gates of Kur. Ancient Egyptian religions believed that man was composed of various elements, some of which were physical, some of which were spiritual. There are similar ideas in the religions of Ancient Assyria and Babylon. The Kottamuwa Stele, a burial stone of 8th-century BC royal officials of the Sam'al dynasty, describes how the Kottamuwa asked his burial attendants to hold a banquet to commemorate his life and afterlife, \"for the sake of my soul on this stone,\" so that the stone could serve as one of the earliest references to the idea that the soul could be separated from the body. It's made of basalt, three feet high, two feet wide. It was discovered during the third excavation of the Neubauer Expedition at the University of Chicago Oriental Institute. The Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith holds that the soul is the symbol of God, the jewel of heaven, and that the most learned cannot grasp its trueness, and that no matter how acute its mystery may be, no one can hope to unravel it.",

Because many Taiwanese soldiers had previously been sent to the front lines, Smith saw Chinese \"Han racism\" firsthand. In 1949, after returning to Taiwan, he was introduced by Chen Baochuan, who recognized him as a high school student of Chiang Kai-shek. At the end of 1951, the assassination of Chiang failed due to the discovery of a gun by the Kuomintang government. On May 19, 1952, Smith's \"Tenzanrin\" arrived in Kobe. Despite successfully escaping from Taiwan, Shimei was arrested by patrolling Japanese police shortly after landing in Kobe, and detained by the Japanese government for several months on charges of \"illegal entry\". In 1952, to make a living while overseas in Japan, Shimei met a Japanese resident in Mainland China, Kyoko Pingga, who was selling noodles and dumplings at a stall in front of the Ikebukuro Station in Ikebukuro, Tokyo. At that time, he visited the National Diet Library of Japan, the Hibiya Library of Literature and Culture, and collected materials related to the history of Taiwan, and recorded and used them. In 1955, in Tokyo, Shimei established contacts with former comrades of Chiang Kai-shek's plan to assassinate Chiang on the island of Taiwan, and began building \"underground operational pipelines\" against the Kuomintang. In April 1967, under the leadership of representatives led by Shimei and Ho Wenshan, the Taiwan Independence Union was established in Tokyo, attempting to associate and unite the various Taiwanese independence movement factions in Japan.

The United Nations also has a permanent observer system, which allows non-members to qualify as members of any United Nations specialized agency. The following is a list in alphabetical order. The United Nations General Assembly may invite non-member entities that are not formally members to participate in the United Nations, and this has happened many times. Such participants are described as observers, some of whom are more clearly interpreted as observers of unofficial member states. The majority of former non-member observer states accept observer status because they have applied for membership but have not been granted, either because of actual or threatened rejection by one or more permanent members of the Council. The right of observers is granted only by the United Nations General Assembly and is not vetoed by the Security Council. An observer state is a sovereign political entity that can apply for membership in the United Nations on a voluntary basis at any time; for example, Switzerland was a permanent observer from 1948 to 2002, before becoming a full member on 10 September 2002. It should be noted that the United Nations considers the Knights of Malta to be a sovereign entity, not a sovereign state. Sixteen former non-members were also granted observer status.

After the end of the ice age, sea levels rose, and with the partial subsidence of the land, the original land was divided into peninsula and island. In the eastern part of the peninsula, the polygonal bay, the curved coastline, is conducive to shipping and development of fisheries. Minerals were scarce, only a small amount of lignite and kaolin. The peninsula has historically been part of Danish territory along with the Scandinavian region and the Isle of Wight. Prior to this, according to Ptolemy, it was the home of the Jodonians, the Symbri, and the Charudes. The Danes built a wall in southern Jutland that extended from the North Sea to the Baltic Sea to resist the Christian Frankish invasion. Charlemagne drove out the pagan Saxons at the southern end of the peninsula (later the Halstein region), and moved the Christian Obots (a group of Slavs who spoke German) there.",

        "paragraph": "American English (abbreviated AE, AmEng, UES, en-US) is a form of English used in the United States. It's the dominant language of the United States. According to the 1990 census, 97 percent of Americans could use English \"good\" or \"good,\" while only 0.8 percent did not use English at all, compared to 3.6 percent in 1890. By 2005, more than two-thirds of native English speakers were using American English. During the British colonization of North America, English was introduced to North America. The first emigration of native English speakers to the United States occurred in the 17th century. At the same time, Dutch, French, Spanish and Swedish are spoken in North America. In contrast to English, many aspects of American English tend to be phonologically conservative. Some people think that some of the North American accents are the same as Elizabethan English, which is still under discussion. Standard American English in the Midwestern and Northern United States is more pronounced than 17th-century English in comparison to contemporary English indigenous tones. The main reason for the conservative pronunciation of American English is that it is a mixture of various dialects from the British Isles. Due to its close relationship with England, the East Coast of the United States remained predominantly British at the time, and the tone of the East Coast of the United States changed with the development of English-speaking America. With relatively little contact between the interior of the United States and the United Kingdom, the original tone was largely preserved. Most contemporary North American English has a curl (also known as a curl), and the letter r is pronounced before the consonant; although English today does not have a curl, this was the case throughout England in the 17th century.",

After the democratization of Taiwan in the 1990s, it became one of the mainstream ideologies. \"Taiwan's subjectivity\" is based on the idea of Taiwan as the center, through the power of multiculturalism and Taiwan nationalism, to break through Chinese centralism, Chinese nationalism or Great Han nationalism, to establish Taiwan as an \"independent country\" democratic system and cultural identity. Taiwanese subjective consciousness, along with the concepts of promoting Taiwanese independence, anti-authority, anti-colonialism, and anti-middle class often form a collection. However, because the ethnic history of the South Islands, European heritage, Chinese traditions, and Japanese Taiwan are all part of Taiwan's history, there is actually a difference. Supporters of Taiwan's subjectivity, such as law and politics scholar Peng Mingmin (Declaration of the Taiwan Self-Defense Movement), historian Cao Yonghe (The History of Taiwan Island), Lin Mazli (The Composition of Taiwanese Blood and the Origin of Taiwanese Ethnic Groups), former president Lee Teng-hui (Special Binationalism), former vice president Lu Xiu-ren (The consensus of '96'), Democratic Progressive Party, Taiwan Solidarity Alliance, Time Force, even musician Xiao Tai-ren, singer Cai Zhen-nan, director Wei De-sheng, all supported or actually participated in the Taiwanization movement, forming a subjective consciousness centered on Taiwan, and developing Taiwan's own culture. Taiwan's subjectivity emphasizes multiculturalism and democratic thought. In the view of Taiwan's subjectivity, the influences of non-Chinese Taiwanese indigenous culture, European culture, Chinese culture (Chinese culture), Japanese culture, American culture, and globalization are all part of Taiwan's historical heritage and modern civilization, hence the criticism that Taiwan's subjectivity is a de-Chineseization. In a speech at an academic conference titled \"New Thinking in the Study of History and Culture\", the Minister of Education of the time of the Communist Party of China, Du Zhengchuan, proposed \"turning 90\u00b0\", \"Taiwan's view map\", emphasizing \"Taiwan must find its own central point\".",

The constellation covers 295 square degrees of the night sky, ranked 48th out of 88 modern constellations. In 1922, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) determined that the three-letter abbreviation \"Tuc\" represented the constellation.

In 1879, the American astronomer Benjamin A. Good described Lacaille as a nebula in the constellation Xi Cuckoo, which is now known as the globular cluster 47 Cuckoo. According to Francis Bailey, Cuckoo was too faint to be assigned the Greek alphabet, so the original name was dropped, and two bodies, now called \u03ba1 and \u03ba2, formed Cuckoo Kappa.

This book is the foundation of modern mathematics and is estimated to be the second most widely published book in the West after the Bible. In all four books, he was assigned to the Department of Astronomical Algorithms. Euclid's Original Geometry consists of 13 volumes. Volumes 1 through 6 deal mainly with planar geometry. The seventh to ninth chapters of the book deal mainly with number theory. Volume 10 discusses unreasonable numbers. Volumes 11 through 13 deal mainly with stereogeometry. Geometry was originally considered by many scholars to be the work of Euclid, who gathered together the principles proved by many of his predecessors and some of his own original proofs, according to an ancient Greek historian Proculus. Euclid wrote the original geometry in 300 BC. It was translated into Arabic, then re-translated into Latin. The first printed book appeared in 1482. The Greek version still exists in various places, such as the Vatican Library or the Bodleian Library at Oxford University. It is regrettable that these existing manuscripts vary in quality and are incomplete. The earliest Chinese translation was the Latin text of Origen (15 volumes), compiled in 1607 by the Italian missionary Limazzo and the Chinese scholar Xu Guangqi, and revised and supplemented by the German priest Christopher Kravius, and named Origen Geometry, from which the Chinese name of geometry is derived.

The name of the town was originally derived from the fact that in order to protect the safety of traveling troops from the mouth of the Great Lake to Zhongli, Taoyuan, it was established Zhang Luliang (present-day Puxin District, Yangmei District), Wang Luliang (present-day Nansei District), and the area between the two places was called Xisei (present-day Pingcheng District, Pingcheng Li Area, present-day Taoyuan 72 Line, along the South Ping Road), and later the security improved, taking the meaning of protecting peace, it was renamed Anping Town.",

The average maximum length of growth for this species is 90 cm, but more than 280 cm have been found. The adult turtle weighs about 135 kg, the heaviest specimen ever found weighing more than 450 kg. The skin is yellow to brown, and the shell is usually reddish-brown. There is not much sex difference before adulthood, and the most notable sex differences among adult turtles are the coarser tail and shorter chest. Red turtles have been found in the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian Ocean and Mediterranean. Most of the turtles live in saltwater and estuarine habitats, and the mother turtles lay their eggs briefly offshore. Red turtles have a low reproductive rate, with females laying an average of four eggs, which they will not lay again for the next two to three years. Turtles are sexually mature between the ages of 17 and 33, with an average lifespan of 47 to 67 years. Red turtles are omnivorous, subsistence invertebrates. The large and powerful lower jaw of the turtle effectively supports its prey. The juvenile turtle has many natural enemies; its eggs are particularly threatened by terrestrial predators. Once adult, the large size of these turtles can cause inconvenience to large marine predators such as sharks. The red turtle is considered endangered and is protected by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Many deaths of turtles are caused by fishing gear. The red turtle will die of suffocation after being trapped in a bottom fishing net. In order to provide turtle escape, turtle escape devices have been installed, with the hope of reducing mortality.",

The Old Hungarian alphabet was once used, but was replaced by the Latin alphabet after Christianity was introduced into the Kingdom of Hungary, but the Old Hungarian alphabet was revived in the Kingdom of Hungary in the late 20th century, and used alongside the Latin alphabet. The Mazar alphabet consists of the Latin letters Q, W, X, and Y, which occur only in foreign words (W and Y, common in Hungarian names, are pronounced V and (J)I, respectively). Sometimes people use the Great Hungarian alphabet and the Small Hungarian alphabet to represent the alphabets with and without Q, W, X and Y, respectively. The language has 14 vowels. The vowels and the vowels can be combined into a number of long vowels. Most of their discrimination is only persistently long or short, but a/\u00e1 and e/\u00e9 differ in both opening size and length. When adding suffixes, Mazar follows the rules of vowel harmony.

After the Battle of Wuhan in October 1938, the Japanese occupied most of the area east of the Beijing\u2013Hanoi and Guangdong\u2013Hanoi railroads, but failed to achieve the goal of forcing the Chongqing National Government and the Chinese military to give up their resistance. Furthermore, the heavy losses suffered by the Japanese army due to the successive attacks of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Army in the Battle of Songhua and other battles in the early stages of the offensive; the fact that the Japanese army itself had to allocate its forces to defend large areas after the occupation made its mobile forces weaker; the guerrilla warfare of the Chinese army in the Japanese-occupied areas also made it necessary for the Japanese army to increase its forces to defend the occupied areas; and Japan's economy was further weakened by the war. As a result, after the Battle of Wuhan, the Japanese army won the occupation of Yueyang and stopped the offensive, and the Chinese anti-Japanese war entered the \"Strategic Compromise Phase\", which Chiang Kai-shek and the Commander-in-Chief of the National Army called the beginning of the \"Second Phase of the Anti-Japanese War\".

The reptiles defined above are considered related because they do not include mammals and birds, and are all descendants of primitive reptiles. Mammals are a monophyletic group, so the parental taxonomy recognizes the traditional taxonomy of mammals; while birds are a monophyletic group, formally called birds. In fact, mammals and birds are subgenera of amphibians. However, reptiles are not an evolutionary branch of the classical taxonomy; they are part of the amphibian family, excluding mammals and birds. There is no identifiable common dimorphism in reptiles. The definition of reptiles includes amphibians with and without features: a lack of feathers and hair. In 1916, Edwin Stephen Goodrich established the lizards and theropods to distinguish between lizards, birds and their relatives, and mammals and their extinct relatives. The differences in the heart and blood vessels of the two evolutionary branches, as well as features of the prefrontal cortex, support this classification. According to Goodrich, the lizards and theropods co-evolved from an earlier protozoan evolution called \"Protosauria\", which also includes some ancient amphibians and early reptiles. In 1956, David Meredith Seares Watson discovered that the two groups began to separate very early in the history of reptiles, so he divided \"Protosauria\" into sauropods and theropods.",

In general metric spaces (i.e., spaces that define distances, such as a two-dimensional plane), the diameter of a set can also be defined. Here the diameter is the smallest upper bound of the distance between two points in the set: a circle can have innumerable diameters (if it refers to the line segment itself), but on the plane, except for any point outside the center of the circle, it has only one diameter. One end of a diameter is called the opposite end of another. Every point on the circumference has one and the same radius. The diameter divides the circle into two parts of equal area (each of which becomes a semicircle), and divides the circumference into two parts of equal growth. The midpoint of diameter is the center of the circle, and the diameter is the longest string on the circle. In other words, the diameter of a circle is the maximum distance that can be reached between any two points on the circumference of the circle. In the same circle, the diameter is twice the radius of r. The ratio of the circumference to the diameter of a circle is the circumference factor. Given a circle and a diameter AB on the circle (A and B are points on the circle), then for any other point C on the circle, the angle ACB is the right angle. If point C is outside the circle, then angle ACB is sharp, and if point C is inside the circle, then angle ACB is blunt. In a rule drawing, if you know a circle and its center, you just draw a line through the center, and the line between the center and the intersection is the diameter of the circle. If the center of the circle is unknown, the diameter can be calculated as the midline of the string. Specifically, if you make a string that is arbitrarily round, and you make the midline of the string, the line segment between the midline and the intersection of the two points of the circle is the diameter of the circle.",

There have been many theories about how the Sailor's Valley formed. In the 1970s, it was thought to be caused by erosion of water or the melting of permafrost in glacial regions. Thermal castration is a relatively plausible effect, but water erosion is unlikely, as liquid water is unlikely to exist on Mars with an atmospheric pressure of less than 1% of Earth's and a temperature of only 148\u2013310 K; however, scientists agree that liquid water may have existed on Mars in the past. The valley may have been formed in the past by the erosion of liquid water. McCauley proposed another hypothesis in 1972 that Sailor's Valley may have formed as a result of erosion of the underlying magma causing the surface to sink. Around 1989, Tanaka and Golombek proposed that it might be caused by a rupture caused by tension.

Since ancient times, China has had a philosophical idea of the unity of the heavens and the earth, and the Chinese believe that the rise and fall of human beings can be manifested through natural changes, and captured in the process of divination. On the one hand, divination is a mysticism, and on the other hand, it is the practical application of various natural scientific experiences. Although divination itself can be used to find information that has already occurred but that cannot be directly accessed due to conditional limitations, most people seem to be more interested in using it to explore the future. As the saying goes, \"The one who goes to the right counts, the one who comes to the wrong counts, and so does the one who goes to the left counts.\" Science can measure weather phenomena that have already occurred and thus successfully predict future weather changes, such as solar eclipses, weather warnings and volcanic eruptions, but these are not prophecies at all. Strictly speaking, fortune-telling predicts the effects of some supernatural force or fate, whereas scientific prediction relies on scientific laws, unfeeling material arguments, and mechanized methods of repetition. Thus, by operational definition, all non-scientific methods of prophecy can be said to be divination. In addition to these simple explanations, there are serious theories about how divination works. One of these theories, based on empirical science, is based on subconsciousness. According to this theory, divination is a process of decoding information contained in the subconscious.",

        "paragraph": "The M3 is a fully automatic, air-cooled, open bolt submachine gun that operates on the principle of recoil. The bolt is usually held open in the rear by a spring; when the trigger is pulled, the bullet is fired with the force of the spring; the bolt has a retractable clasp in front of it, which grips the shell and fires the bullet simultaneously; when fired, the bullet is ejected by high pressure gas produced by the ignition of the ammunition; when the trigger is pulled, the bullet is released by a retractable clasp; if the trigger finger is not loosened, the bullet is fired until the bullet is exhausted; if the trigger finger is loosened, the bolt is again held open in the rear. If the trigger finger is not loosened when the bullet is fired, the bolt will snap forward to the barrel. At this point, after changing the receiver, the right handle must be pulled backwards, driving the bolt backwards, compressing the recoil spring to be held by the spring, recovering the position of the ready firing. Each bolt bore one hole, each bore one guide rod, and the double spring outer guide rod contracted as the bolt moved back and forth. This design allows for the use of less sophisticated and inexpensive parts. Due to the low pressure produced by the.45 ACP cartridge and the heavy bolt, the M3 submachine gun does not require a complex chamber closure or delay mechanism. The safety of the M3 is located in a retractable case at the top right of the barrel, with a raised iron plate that holds the bolt. The M3 does not have a safety mechanism that locks the trigger, so inserting a magazine with a bullet while the bolt is pressed backwards is equivalent to inserting a bullet. The M3 magazine is a 30-round magazine with a single round of double-barreled ammunition, similar to the magazine of the Sten submachine gun. On the right side of the barrel, above the front of the trigger is the grip assembly, which consists of nine parts.

During the Second Sino-Japanese War, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) led by the Communist Party of China (CPC) launched an offensive against the National Revolutionary Army (NRA) in northern Henan Province. In early 1947, the U.S. Army switched from a full-scale offensive to a major offensive. Due to the concentration of the national army in the northern Shaanxi and Shandong battlefields, a dumbbell-like situation emerged in the war. On both sides of the east and west lines, a large number of troops were engaged in constant fighting, while in the middle zone, on the Jinzhiluyuan line, both sides took up defensive positions. Due to the large number of elite troops drawn from the national army to intensify the offensive in Shandong and northern Shaanxi, the central defenses were weak. Accordingly, Liu Beisheng, the commander of the Hunan Field Army of the Jin Jiru, and Deng Xiaoping, the political commissar, decided to launch a counterattack in the northern part of the Hunan region, a key area linking Shandong and northern Shandong battlefields, in order to fight the Liberation Army in Shandong and northern Shandong battlefields. The National Army deployed 31 regular brigades and local security teams totaling 300,000 men on the battlefield of Jinhe Luyuan, of which 6 reorganization divisions and 1 temporary reorganization column served as defenses on the northern front.

In today's Chinese-speaking world, \u7e23 exists mainly as a sub-district, but in Japan it is a first-class administrative district. As an administrative unit with a long history in China, modern Chinese scholars believe that counties are the watersheds of local administration in China's feudal dynasties. Its view is that the administration of the central government only affects the administrative districts above the county, and below the county is in a state of \"local autonomy\". In China, \"county\" became the name of administrative units in the spring and autumn period. Prior to this, the Zhou Dynasty was politically divided. There are different usages for this class of administrative units in the pre-Qin Dynasty, and the usages of warring states are particularly mixed. In the Western Zhou period, it was written \"han.\" In the late Qing Dynasty, Tang Degang believed that the origin of \"county\" was when Zhou Wu divided the princes, because he did not want to give the princes too large a fiefdom, and did not want to divide too many foreign princes, leading to \"many places that are neither Wangki nor suitable people can be sealed\", these lands \"hanged undecided\", only temporarily dispatched people to manage, waiting for suitable people to seal, called \"hanging\", and later evolved into \"county\". However, it is doubtful that the word \"kan\" was used in the pre-Qin Dynasty except in the Warring States Qin Dynasty, whereas the word \"kan\" was used in the Western Zhou Dynasty, whereas the word \"kan\" was used in the Eastern Zhou Dynasty. In the spring and autumn periods, the lords were annexed, and after the great powers destroyed the small states, if they did not want to divide the land to the nobility, they were also set up as counties.

During the Song and Yuan Dynasties, peasant uprisings in the eastern and northern parts of the country also caused enormous losses.

The problems that dominated economic hypotheses and theories at the time were becoming increasingly apparent, and John Maynard Keynes was one of the early thinkers to recognize these problems. When physics began to question the necessity of absolute time, writers began to question narrative structure, composers began to question the necessity of harmonious tonal harmony, Keynes began to question the two pillars of economics at the time: first, whether money had to have a firm foundation, usually the gold standard, and second, that if demand decreased, supply or price would decrease accordingly, thereby rebalancing. Keynes himself was closely associated with London's Bloomsbury district, and was fascinated by the atmosphere that changed people's minds. It was this experience and the signing of the Treaty of Versailles that ultimately led him to break with traditional theories. In 1920 he wrote The Economic Consequences of Peace, in which he not only elaborated on the overall economic consequences of the Treaty of Versailles as he saw it, but also established his position as an economist with practical political experience that could influence national decision-making. In the 1930s, Keynes published a series of articles on the effects of national power and overall economic trends, developed a theory that monetary policy was not just a fixed reference, and he became increasingly convinced that economic systems did not automatically follow a curve that economics called the productivity curve. But he didn't find any evidence, and he didn't find any form of expression for these ideas. In the late 1930s, the globalized economic system began to hit the United Kingdom \u2014 the central country at the time.",

By the time he was commissioned, the Navy was still using pre-armored wooden sailing ships, and by the time he retired, the Navy was already using steel battlecruisers, submarines, and aircraft carriers. An argumentative, energetic, forward-thinking man, Fisher is often cited as the second most important figure in the history of the British navy after Lord Nelson. Although he had extensive combat experience, he was remembered as an innovator, strategist, and promoter of naval development, rather than a naval commander involved in major naval battles. In 1904, he was appointed First Minister of the Navy. He decommissioned the next 150 obsolete warships, and began building replacements for modern warships. Fisher felt that the navy needed to improve the range, accuracy, and speed of the guns. He was also one of the first to advocate the use of torpedoes, which he believed would eventually replace heavy artillery as the main anti-ship weapon. During his tenure as naval governor, he introduced the torpedo boat destroyer class to the navy.

General engineering can be divided into four main categories: In addition, there are other engineering fields, formerly classified as mining engineering and marine engineering, and now classified as industrial engineering and materials engineering. The British Engineering Commission covers many of these areas of engineering. Occasionally, special applications integrate these traditional fields into a new one, such as Earth Systems Engineering and Management, which includes philosophy, ethics, anthropology, environmental sciences, and engineering studies. Some new fields are temporarily defined as a combination of some existing fields, so there are still many grey areas as to whether a particular application is considered a field, a major indicator being whether a major university has a department, institute, or course in the field. There is considerable overlap in these areas, especially in the applied sciences, such as mathematics, physics, and chemistry. The most critical and unique task of an engineer is to discover, understand and combine practical limitations to achieve satisfactory results. In many cases, the product doesn't just have to meet the technical requirements, it has to meet other requirements as well.

In the early days of the KMT's rise to power, after the 28th Incident, the KMT became quite sensitive to public gatherings of the people, and in 1938, the KMT imposed martial law, banning puppetry outside the theatre, thus allowing puppetry to develop inside the theatre, opening the way for the multi-faceted development of puppetry.

For observers on Earth, when Planet Nine is at its farthest point from the Sun, it will appear in either Orion or Taurus. According to Brown's conjecture, assuming the existence of Planet Nine, it would take at least 20 years to reach the planet if a spacecraft were to be launched from Earth, using the gravitational pull to navigate its orbit around the Sun. The planet's mass is estimated to be 10 times that of Earth, and its diameter is between 2 and 4 times that of Earth. Brown argues that if the ninth planet existed, its mass would be sufficient to clear its orbit of large objects within 4.6 billion years (with the possible exception of certain combinations of semi-major axes and mass) and its gravity-driven outer edge of the Solar System would be, by current definition, sufficient to make it a planet. Brown speculated that Planet Nine might be an ejected ice giant, similar in composition to Uranus and Neptune: a mixture of rock and ice and a portion of gas. In fact, if it had once flown between Jupiter and Neptune, the planet might have contained hydrogen and helium. Chad Cherkyro and Scott Shepherd were the first to describe the orbital classification of extreme trans-Neptunian objects, pointing to similarities in the orbits of asteroids 90377 and 2012 VP113.

Yuan appointed Huang Xing to stay in Nanjing, the main purpose of which was to use Huang Xing to demobilize the army, but Huang thought that the time for construction had come and that the Yuan clan could be promised through democracy, so he aggressively disbanded the Jiangnan region, which was occupied by the Allied forces, such as the revolutionary army near Nanjing, in just two months' time by three divisions instead of two.

Both Descartes and Fermat had a single coordinate axis. When Frans van Schooten and his students translated Geometry into Latin in 1649, they introduced concepts to explain some of its ideas, including the second coordinate axis. The Cartesian coordinate system underpins the calculus invented by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz. After the Cartesian coordinate system, people created more coordinate systems, like the polar coordinate system in the plane, and the sphere coordinate system and the cylindrical coordinate system in three-dimensional space. A two-dimensional orthogonal coordinate system is usually defined by two mutually perpendicular coordinate axes, usually called the x-axis and the y-axis, respectively; the intersection of the two coordinate axes, called the origin, is usually denoted by O, both meaning \"zero\" and the French initial \"Origine\". Each axis points in a particular direction. The coordinate axis of these two different lines determines a plane, called the xy-plane, also known as the Cartesian plane. Normally, as long as the two coordinate axes are perpendicular to each other, their direction is not affected by the analytic problem, but habitually, the x-axis is horizontally pendulous, called the horizontal axis, usually pointing to the right; the y-axis is vertically pendulous, called the vertical axis, usually pointing upwards. Such a positional relationship between two coordinate axes is called a two-dimensional right-hand coordinate system, or right-hand system. If you draw this right-handed system on a transparent piece of paper, and you rotate it in the plane no matter how, the result is called the right-handed system; but if you rotate the piece of paper, the coordinate system that you see on the back is called the left-handed system.",

What the Yugoslav legislature did was a graphic decision made by the Politburo. The National Security Agency (NSA) of the Yugoslav secret police operates much more strictly than those in other parts of Eastern Europe, but is still regarded as a formidable tool of government control. The media in Yugoslavia is still severely constrained by Western standards, but it still enjoys greater freedom. Nationalist groups are a special target in the eyes of the authorities.

However, the actual situation may differ from country to country. The sovereignty of a State over its territorial sea, its airspace and its continental shelf, as a part of its territory, is inviolable, but his State may exercise the right of passage over its territorial sea. The territorial sea was established on the basis of three principles: the state must occupy its coast for security purposes and protect its coast from offshore waters; the state must inspect and control ships in and out of its coastal harbours for commercial, financial or political purposes; and the state must possess the resources in its coastal waters in order to maintain the livelihoods of its inhabitants. The width of the territorial sea was at the heart of the controversy. From the 16th to the 17th centuries, the concepts were ambiguous. Initially, it was believed that this was due to the proximity of the sea. Later Dutch international jurists, such as Grotius, used the \"cannon shot\" as the area of control of the sea. Countries in the Mediterranean have also adopted the \"shore range\" argument. The Scandinavian countries of northern Europe define their territorial sea as a fixed distance along the coast. In the aforementioned claims, the \"shore gun range\" was generally accepted, and since the average 18th-century gun range did not exceed 3 nautical miles (5.6 km), some nations set their territorial sea width at 3 nautical miles. By 1945, the custom was gradually being changed to 12 miles (22 km) or even 200 miles (370 km). The 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea defined the limit as 12 nautical miles.",

Mobutu launched his second coup d'\u00e9tat in November 1965, taking control of the country. Under Mobutu, the Congo (renamed Sa\u00ef in 1971) was transformed into a dictatorship until Mobutu was overthrown in 1997. Congolese colonial rule began in the late 19th century. Since Belgium's independence from the Netherlands in 1830, the kingdom's lack of international power and prestige frustrated King Leopold II of Belgium, who sought to persuade the government to support expansion around the then undeveloped colonies of the Congo Basin. The idea was so controversial with the government that Leopold eventually founded his own colony. Many supportive Western countries viewed Rio de Janeiro as an effective buffer against power struggles between the colonies, so Rio de Janeiro's private colony, the Free State of the Congo, was recognized internationally in 1885. Belgium's rule in the Congo was based on the so-called \"colonial trinity\" of state, missionaries and private companies. During the 1940s and 1950s, Congo experienced unprecedented levels of urbanization, and the colonial government launched various development programs aimed at making the territory a \"model colony.\" The African nationalism movement developed in the 1950s outside of the Congo, mainly in the \"\u00e9volu\u00e9s\". The movement split several ethnically and geographically divergent political parties and groups. The greatest enemy of the Congolese national movement was the Abako League, led by Joseph Kasawubu. Despite being Africa's largest nationalist party, the National Movement has many different factions and positions on many issues.",

On 29 April 1952, Zhang Zhen, the Minister of Warfare of the Central Military Commission, was commissioned by the East China Military Region to report to the Central Military Commission and Mao Zedong that two divisions of the 21st Army, then stationed in eastern Zhejiang and northeastern Minchuan, would attack and liberate the other coastal islands of eastern Zhejiang with the support of the Navy and Air Force. Mao Zedong's advice was to wait until after the Korean Armistice to renegotiate. The 21st Army then went on to battle in the morning. In January 1953, Zhang Aiping led a team to the Fujian front line, concluding that the north-south occupation of the islands of Fujian and Zhejiang was to be replaced by the south-north occupation, that is, the first to occupy Dai, Xiao Jinmen, Non-War or Small War to occupy the other islands of Fujian and Zhejiang. The military commission approved the plan, and prepared to carry out the campaign by land and sea with 200,000 troops, first repairing airports in coastal areas of Fuqing, Dong'an, and Zhangzhou, and constructing railway embankments between Xiamen Island and mainland China. After the Korean War ended, in August 1953, the United States and the United States Army conducted the first joint military exercise in the Taiwan Strait, publicly declaring their determination to defend Taiwan militarily. At the end of 1953, Mao Zedong, at a meeting of the Military Commission in Hangzhou, suggested that the Taiwan question could be resolved. In early 1954, the Treaty of Mutual Defense between the United States and China began to be drafted. Against this backdrop, it was difficult for the PLA to strike large and small, and it could only try to find the bottom line for the U.S. military's involvement in the near-sea warfare of mainland China by attacking islands from the north to the south, in small- and medium-scale battles. Mao Zedong said: \"The situation has changed, we are ready to fight Da Chen, settle the coastal islands of Zhejiang first, we expect the emperor will not intervene much.",

But traditional wooden stoppers are much more environmentally friendly. Wine is a natural and fragile beverage, vulnerable to light, heat, vibration, and excessive humidity. Traditionally, wine cellars have provided a lightless and warm environment for wine, in addition to protecting it from damage from unstable external environments, and also providing it with a good shelf life.

However, this is only according to the conservation conditions obtained by traditional wisdom, and has not been rigorously scientifically investigated.

The varieties of grapes vary widely, and the geographical location, latitude, soil and climate of different regions all have suitable varieties for cultivation.

The Carabinieri Command for Liberated Italy was formed in Bari in the south and recruited new recruits to join the Italian Liberation Movement, as well as the Italian Co-Belligerent Army, which had already entered Italy, to fight the remaining Fascist parties in the north with the help of Nazi Germany. After the rescue of Mussolini, the remnants of the Fascists organized themselves in the north, remaining loyal to Mussolini's cavalry, and some of the surviving members of the Blackshirts, to form a \"Blackshirts Brigade\", which retaliated fiercely against Fascist opponents in its areas of control, and fought against the Liberation Army and Allied forces in the south. Although at its peak, the Blackshirts once claimed to have more than 49 brigade-level units, each \"brigade\" was only a small regiment, with no more than 1,2000 men. Due to the role of the Cavalry in the fall of Mussolini and the fact that one of the only two teams to fight the Germans during the Nazi occupation of Rome was a student battalion from the Second Cavalry School, the Germans became extremely distrustful of the Cavalry. After the German occupation of northern Italy in October 1943 and the formation of the Italian Social Republic, all cavalry units in the occupation zone were disbanded, many officers and men were arrested and deported to Germany as forced labor.",

Phoenix, Crane, Peacock, and Tucana are the four birds of the Southern Hemisphere. It's the brightest star in the constellation, and it's a bright orange giant with a magnitude of 2.37. The second-brightest Mars Nine is composed of two orange giants, a binary star with a combined apparent magnitude of 3.31. Phoenix has a disk of debris. We've discovered planets in 10 of the Phoenix constellations, and in the 21st century we've discovered the Phoenix Cluster and the Elgordo Cluster, two of the largest observable galaxies in the universe, 5.7 and 7.2 billion light-years away from Earth, respectively. There are two meteor showers in Phoenix, in July and December, respectively, and the latest research suggests that there may be seven more. The Dutch navigators and explorers Pieter Keyser and Frederick de Houtman, who accompanied the first Dutch expedition to the East Indies with the Indonesian fleet, charted twelve constellations in the southern sky, the largest of which was Phoenix.

In the 1960s, the existence of brown dwarfs was theoretically postulated. At the time of the discovery of the theory by Hiv Kumar in the 1960s, what is now known as a brown dwarf was known as a black dwarf. The term \"black dwarf\" now refers to white dwarfs that have cooled to the point where they no longer emit visible light. However, it has been calculated that even the least massive white dwarfs take much longer to cool to this temperature than the present age of the universe, so it is not expected that such objects will exist.",

The logo allows users to interact with resources in the network (generally referred to as the World Wide Web) through specific protocols. The most common form of a URI is the Uniform Resource Locator (URL), often designated as an informal URL. A more rare use is the Uniform Resource Name (URN), which aims to provide a pathway. Used to mark a resource in a particular namespace, to complement a URL. URIs can be viewed as locators (URLs), names (URNs), or both. A Uniform Resource Name (URN) is like a person's name, and a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is like a person's address. In other words, the URN defines the identity of something, and the URL provides a way to find that thing. An ISBN system used to identify a unique bibliographical object is a typical URN usage example. For example, ISBN 0-486-27557-4 uniquely marks a particular version of Shakespeare's play Romeo and Juliet. In order to access the resource and read the book, people need its location, which is a URL address. In a Unix-like operating system, a typical URL address may be a file directory, such as file:///home/username/RomeoAndJuliet.pdf. The URL indicates an e-book file stored on your local hard drive.

On September 1, 2015, the Taipei Metro Multi-Card Card System was completed, Kaohsiung One-Card entered the BeiJet, expected to have one to two multi-card boxes at each station to install a check-in machine, at the time the entire line can use Kaohsiung One-Card, and enjoy the same advantages as the YuYu Card, except for a discount on board the MRT, you can also borrow YouBike; and for one card first used in BeiJet, but the YuYu Card can not be used at the same time in Kaohsiung Metro, leading to \"snack big\" and unequal question. The company announced that it had signed a memorandum of understanding with Gucci at the end of July, stating that Gucci had not yet completed the installation of the IndyCart facility, and that it would not be able to open it to the public, and that Gucci had promised to fully open it to the public by the end of July 2016. However, the city of Taipei City Councillor Chen Shigewen questioned that one card currently issued more than 5 million cards, get an 8 percent discount on BeiJet, the price difference is paid by the city of BeiJet, the circulation of more than 50 million leisure cards, if you want to control the comparison with GJet, because one card is a privately owned company, not a publicly owned company, so the city of Kaohsiung government can not control whether the subsidized benefits budget.",

In November 2008, he was appointed vice-chairman of the Kuomintang, and resigned at the end of April 2014. In April 2011, the KMT's rival Luo Shulai defeated Chiang Kai-shek by less than one percent in the KMT's primary poll, but Chiang Kai-shek decided to withdraw from the Legislative Council of Taipei City's 3rd constituency and entered the coalition, and demonstrated a gentlemen's spirit to actively serve as the head of the Luo Shulai Legislative Council election team. In 2016, his son Chiang Wanan was elected to the Legislative Council of Taipei's 3rd constituency, which he previously ran, and he will be re-elected in 2020. The song was originally titled \"Chang Xiaoyian\", but Zhang Xiaoyian repeatedly tried to meet Song Meiling, and Song Meiling did not meet. He also asked Chiang Kai-shek's wife, Chiang Kai-shek, and Chiang Kai-shek's legally married children to be recognized, but they were unsuccessful. Zhang Xiaoqi was adamantly opposed to Zhang Xiaoyan's change of surname, and did not agree with his mother's behavior before his birth. It was not until the death of Chiang Kai-shek in December 2004 that he changed his surname to Chiang Kai-shek and said that his children would follow him. His younger brother, Zhang Xiaoqi, had died and could not be given a surname. His paternal grandparents were his maternal great-grandparents, and his paternal great-grandparents were his maternal great-grandparents. It is believed that he was the son of the former British ambassador to Paraguay, King George VI, and that he was the father of two sons, both of whom died in exile.",

        "paragraph": "The Vice-Chairman ranks second only to the Chairman of the Central Committee, above the Standing Committee of other non-Party Vice-Chairmen. The Twelfth Congress of the Communist Party of China abolished the positions of President and Vice-President of the Party, and stipulated that the three positions of Chairman of the Military Committee of the CPC Central Committee, Chairman of the Advisory Committee of the CPC Central Committee, and First Secretary of the CPC Central Committee of the Communist Party of China must be held by members of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. This rule was abolished after the 13th Deng Xiaoping and others withdrew from the Politburo Standing Committee. The Standing Committee of the Politburo of the Communist Party of China is the highest-ranking body of the Communist Party of China and the Government of the People's Republic of China at the \"State level\". The list of members of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the People's Republic of China after the founding of the People's Republic of China is usually arranged according to qualifications and positions, reflecting their status in the Party and the government, the list of attendance at official events, etc. However, the ranking of the Standing Committee is generally determined by the party's history and status, so sometimes it is not necessarily linked to the level of the official positions held, and the number of members is not necessarily single, for example, the six Standing Committee members elected at the 1st Plenary Session of the 12th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China ranked first as General Secretary of the CPC Hu Yaobang, second as Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission Ye Jianying, third as Chairman of the Central Military Commission Deng Xiaoping, fourth as Premier of the State Council Zhao Ziyang, fifth as President Li Shen-ming, and sixth as First Secretary of the Central Military Commission Chen Yun. The meetings of the Standing Committee of the Politburo are usually held once a week. The sixteenth and seventeenth Politburo Standing Committees increased from seven members at the fourteenth and fifteenth sessions to nine, and the eighteenth resumed to seven.",

There was a dispute within the Fourth Army to expel the commander Mu Bainan, to meet the commander Zhang Fu Kui, and Xue Yue to become Zhang's deputy. On the morning of November 17, 1927, the Zhang Huang Incident broke out in Guangzhou. After the uprising in Guangzhou, the main force of the 4th Guangdong Army could not return to the East River for a while, so they had to transfer the Xue Yue Division in the direction of the West River to the city, completely suppressing the Communist Party in Guangzhou. In the second half of 1927, this series of incidents resulted in heavy losses for the 4th Guangdong Army. Zhang Fukui's Guangdong army pursued the political strategy of Wang Sewei's restructuring, accepting Chiang Kai-shek's restructuring in 1928 to participate in the Second Northern Expedition; in the 1930s, Zhang Fukui's Guangdong army's Fourth Army turned against Guilin's Li Zongren and Bai Chonghui together against Chiang. When the Guangdong (Zhang Fukui) Gui coalition army entered Hengyang, the Guangdong army's Jiang Guangxu and Cai Tingkai followed, broke off the road behind Zhang Fukui. This led to the Battle of Hengyang, which resulted in the crushing defeat of the Zhang and Gui allied armies. Zhang Fukui laid hands, the Fourth Army was forced to surrender to Chiang Kai-shek, centralization was implemented, Xue Yue became the commander of the Fourth Army, Xue Yue led the Cantonese Fourth Army abandoned Gui Gui to Chiang, the background was at that time Wang Jiang merged. Since then, in the Central Military System, because Chen Cheng also had the experience of the Guangdong First Division, the cadres of the Zhejiang Army System and the Guangdong First Division of the Tang Dynasty were incorporated into Chen Cheng's small group of cadres who wanted to take over the Chen Cheng Guanna base.",
