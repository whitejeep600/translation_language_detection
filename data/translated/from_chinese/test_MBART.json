He obtained a scholarship to study at Tokyo Polytechnic University to explore world literature. Four years later, he graduated with a bachelor's degree in literature from Tokyo Polytechnic University. In 1917, Chen Shui-jin was ordered by Sun Yat-sen to lead the Chinese Revolutionary Party in Canada. At that time, the assassination of Tang Hualong occurred in Canada. Chen Shui-jin was accused by the local government of being the mastermind, and arrested. After being heavily rescued by overseas Chinese and revolutionary party members, Chen Shui-jin regained his freedom. In 1922, Chen Shui-jin returned from Canada, at the time of Chen's rebellion in Guangdong, and Sun Yat-sen took refuge on the Yongfeng Ship. He returned to Guangzhou immediately after the Chinese Revolution, and ventured to visit Sun Yat-sen on the Yongfeng Ship. Sun Yat-sen instructed Chen Shui-jin to return to Shanghai from Hong Kong promptly, and sent him to Shanghai as minister of party affairs.",

Tufts can grow under harsh environmental conditions, often pioneering the occupation of new land by organisms. Under extremely dry conditions, tufts can also remove water, enter a dormant state, wait for conditions to improve, and resume high-speed growth.

This is significantly shorter than the age of the Solar System, with only a few remnants of the early Solar System. The two main causes of family collapse are slow orbital dispersal caused by perturbations from Jupiter or other larger bodies, and collisions between asteroids and crushing them into smaller individuals. These tiny individuals are subject to the Yarkovsky effect, and are constantly pushed into the resonance orbit of Jupiter over time. Once they enter, they are quickly ejected into the main belt of small planets. Prospective estimates of the age range of some families range from less than a few million years to several billion years, such as the dense Karen family. Older families are thought to have only a small number of microscopic members, which is the basis for age determination.",

Power outages generally refer to the lack of electricity supply in a certain area. They are a disaster. Power outages are planned by a person, possibly for reasons such as blockage of electricity, maintenance of electricity facilities, retaliation or threats to others. The purpose of power outages can also be: to reduce the amount of electricity consumed when there is a shortage of electricity, or to enforce lighting controls or even restrictions on electricity consumption. For example, Hong Kong implemented lighting controls in 1973-1974 due to the first oil crisis. In cities, fluorescent tubes, LED signs and large display screens are kept lit at night. Heavy lights often make it difficult for residents to sleep, so some cities have introduced regulations requiring businesses to turn off advertising signs and display screens at night.",

        "paragraph": "The emergence of Protestantism stems from Martin Luther, a professor of theology and a Catholic priest, who criticized the excessive use of the Holy See for the atonement of sins. The decadent corruption of the Catholic Church, the ravages of the Reformation, and the deaths of the Jesuits ultimately triggered the Reformation. Indeed, after Luther entered the monastery in 1505, he experienced a great spiritual struggle of faith, \"a deep sense of guilt and a lack of the joy of God.\" At the beginning of the 16th century, under the high tolerance of the Catholic Church, the issue of the atonement of sins went out of control. The spirit of Protestant intransigence can be traced back to some of the forerunners of the Reformation in the 14th century, such as the Wickreeves of England, and the followers of the Lairds, the Jan Hussites of Bohemia, and the Savonarola of Italy. In the 20th century, Martin Luther launched the Reformation movement in Germany, quickly sweeping the whole of Germany, and in Geneva, Calvin's Reformation further deepened the influence of the Reformation.",
