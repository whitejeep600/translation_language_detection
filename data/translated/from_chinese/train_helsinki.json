The Gini coefficient is regulated by requiring the State to allocate national income twice through fiscal policy, such as spending on public financial services and taxes to the population, thereby equalizing income and reducing the Gini coefficient. Organizations such as the United Nations Development Programme provide that, normally, 0.4 is the \u201cguard line\u201d of the income distribution gap, and when the divide between the rich and the poor is greater than that of the \u201cguard line\u201d it is, it is easier for the social class to confront it.
